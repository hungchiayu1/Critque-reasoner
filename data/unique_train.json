"Context: A glacier cave is a cave formed within the ice of a glacier.Glacier caves are often called ice caves, but the latter term is properly used to describe bedrock caves that contain year-round ice.[1].Most glacier caves are started by water running through or under the glacier.This water often originates on the glacier's surface through melting, entering the ice at a moulin and exiting at the glacier's snout at base level.Heat transfer from the water can cause sufficient melting to create an air-filled cavity, sometimes aided by solifluction.Air movement can then assist enlargement through melting in summer and sublimation in winter..Some glacier caves are formed by geothermal heat from volcanic vents or hotsprings beneath the ice.An extreme example is the Kverkfj\u00f6ll glacier cave in the Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland, measured in the 1980s at 2.8 kilometres (1.7mi) long with a vertical range of 525 metres (1,722ft)..Some glacier caves are relatively unstable due to melting and glacial motion, and are subject to localized or complete collapse, as well as elimination by glacial retreat.An example of the dynamic nature of glacier caves is the former Paradise Ice Caves, located on Mount Rainier in the United States.Known since the early 1900s, the caves were thought to have disappeared altogether in the mid-1940s, yet in 1978 cavers measured 13.25 kilometres (8.23mi) of passageways in glacier caves there, and it was then considered the longest glacier cave system in the world.The Paradise Ice Caves collapsed and vanished in the 1990s, and the lower lobe of the glacier which once contained the caves has also vanished entirely between 2004 and 2006..\nQ: how are glacier caves formed?\nReasoning: A partly submerged glacier cave on Perito

of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular arc.It can be uniform, with a constant rate of rotation and constant tangential speed, or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation.The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves the circular motion of its parts.The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body, which remains at a constant distance from the axis of rotation.In circular motion, the distance between the body and a fixed point on its surface remains the same, i.e., the body is assumed rigid..Examples of circular motion include: special satellite orbits around the Earth (circular orbits), a ceiling fan's blades rotating around a hub, a stone that is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles, a car turning through a curve in a race track, an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, and a gear turning inside a mechanism..Since the object's velocity vector is constantly changing direction, the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation.Without this acceleration, the object would move in a straight line, according to Newton's laws of motion..In physics, uniform circular motion describes the motion of a body traversing a circular path at a constant speed.Since the body describes circular motion, its distance from the axis of rotation remains constant at all times.Though the body's speed is constant, its velocity is not constant: velocity, a vector quantity, depends on both the body's speed and its direction of travel.This changing velocity indicates the presence of an acceleration; this centripetal acceleration is of constant magnitude and directed at all times toward the axis of rotation.\nQ: How are the directions of the velocity and force vectors related in a circular motion\nReasoning: In physics , circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a

death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out.Thus with either death or endowment, the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years.However, some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase \"paid up additions\" to the

improve the financial literacy of girls.During an average selling season (usually January through April), more than one million girls sell over 200 million packages of cookies and raise over $800 million.[2][3] The first known sale of cookies by Girl Scouts was in 1917.[4][5][6] Cookie sales are organized by 112 regional Girl Scout councils[7] who select one of two national bakeries to buy cookies from.[3][8].The bakery selected determines which cookie varieties are available, when girls can begin selling cookies in their area, and cookie price.[5][9][10] The bakery is paid about 25 to 35 percent of the profits; 45 to 65 percent is used by the regional council to cover programming costs; and 10 to 20 percent is kept by the local troop[11] whose members decide how to spend their

magazine The American Girl suggested cookie sales as a fundraiser and provided a simple sugar cookie recipe from a regional director for the Girl Scouts of Chicago.[14] In 1928, the Girl Scout manual suggested sales of cookies to make a troop self-supporting.[15] In 1933, Girl Scouts in Philadelphia organized the first commercial sale, selling homemade cookies at the windows of the Philadelphia Gas and Electric Company (PGE).In 1934, the first official cookie sale was by the Girl Scout Council, in Philadelphia, contracting with a commercial bakery.[15] From 1933 to 1935, organized cookie sales rose, with troops in Philadelphia and New York City using the cookie-selling model to develop the marketing and sales skills of their local troops.[16] In 1936, Girl Scouts of the USA began licensing commercial bakers to produce cookies, in order to increase availability and reduce lead time, starting with Keebler-Weyl Bakery.[17] Southern Biscuit Company and Burry Biscuit,[18][19] both later acquired by the Interbake Foods division of George Weston Limited, were added in 1937.One hundred twenty five troops launched cookie sales that first year.[20].During World War II the Girl

ballet shoe,[1][2][3][4] is a type of shoe worn by ballet dancers when performing pointe work.Pointe shoes were conceived in response to the desire for dancers to appear weightless and sylph-like and have evolved to enable dancers to dance en pointe (on the tips of their toes) for extended periods of time.They are manufactured in a variety of colors, most commonly in shades of light pink..Women began to dance ballet in 1681, twenty years after King Louis XIV of France ordered the founding of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse.[5] At that time, the standard women's ballet shoe had heels.In 1835 dancer Marie Camargo of the Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet was the first to wear a non-heeled shoe, enabling her to perform leaps that would have been difficult, if not impossible, in the more conventional shoes of the age.[6] After the French Revolution, heels were completely eliminated from standard ballet shoes.These flat-bottomed predecessors of the modern pointe shoe were secured to the feet by ribbons and incorporated pleats under the toes to enable dancers to leap, execute turns, and fully extend their feet..The first dancers to rise up on their toes did so with the help of an invention by Charles Didelot in 1796.[7] His \"flying machine\" lifted dancers upward, allowing them to stand on their toes before leaving the ground.[6] This lightness and ethereal quality was well received by audiences and, as a result, choreographers began to look for ways to incorporate more pointe work into their pieces..As dance progressed into the 19th century, the emphasis on technical skill increased, as did the desire to dance en pointe without the aid of wires.When Marie Taglioni first danced La Sylphide en pointe, her shoes were nothing more than modified satin slippers; the soles were made of leather and the sides and toes were darned to help the shoes hold their shapes.[8] Because the shoes of this period offered no support, dancers would pad their toes for comfort and rely on the strength of their feet and ankles for support..The next substantially different form of pointe shoe appeared in Italy in the late 19th century.Dancers like Pierina Legnani wore shoes with a sturdy, flat platform at the front end of the shoe, rather than the more sharply pointed toe of earlier models.These shoes also included a box\u2014made of layers of fabric\u2014for containing the

skin to turn bluish.[8] Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.[3].Cholera is caused by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, with some types producing more severe disease than others.[2] It is spread mostly by unsafe water and unsafe food that has been contaminated with human feces containing the bacteria.[2] Undercooked shellfish is a common source.[9] Humans are the only known host for the bacteria.[2] Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, insufficient clean drinking water, and poverty.[2] Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test,[2] or a rapid dipstick test, although the dipstick test is less accurate.[10].Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water.[5] Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months, and confer the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by E.coli.[2] In 2017 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a single-dose, live, oral cholera vaccine called Vaxchora for adults aged 18\u201364 who are travelling to an area of active cholera transmission.[11] It offers limited protection to young children.People who survive an episode of cholera have long-lasting immunity for at least 3 years (the period tested.)[12].The primary treatment for affected individuals is oral rehydration salts (ORS), the replacement of fluids and electrolytes by using slightly sweet and salty solutions.[2] Rice-based solutions are preferred.[2] In children, Zinc supplementation has also been found to improve outcomes.[6] In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as Ringer's lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial.[2] The choice of antibiotic is aided by antibiotic sensitivity testing.[3].Cholera continues to affect an estimated 3\u20135million people worldwide and causes 28,800\u2013130,000deaths a year.[2][7] To date, seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the developing world, with the most recent beginning in 1961, and continuing today.[13] The illness is rare in high-income countries, and affects children most severely.[2][14] Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas.[2] Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and Southeast Asia.[2] The risk of death among those affected is usually less than 5%, given improved treatment, but may be as high as 50% without such access to treatment.[2] Descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC in Sanskrit.[5] In Europe, cholera was a term initially used to describe any kind of gastroenteritis, and was not used for this disease until the early 19th century.[15] The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology because of his insights about transmission via contaminated water, and a map of the same was the first recorded incidence of epidemiological tracking.[5][16].The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid.[17] These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria.[18] The diarrhea is frequently described as \"rice water\" in nature and may have a fishy odor.[17] An untreated person with cholera may produce 10 to 20 litres (3 to 5USgal) of diarrhea a day.[17] Severe cholera, without treatment, kills about half of affected individuals.[17] If the severe diarrhea is not treated, it can result in life-threatening dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.[17] Estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100.[19] Cholera has been nicknamed the \"blue death\"[20] because a person's skin may turn bluish-gray from extreme loss of fluids.[21].Fever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection.Patients can be lethargic and might have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, or wrinkled hands and feet.Kussmaul breathing, a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of acidosis from stool bicarbonate losses and lactic acidosis associated with poor perfusion.Blood pressure drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time.Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, seizures, or even coma due to electrolyte imbalances are common, especially in children.[17].\nQ: how are cholera and typhus transmitted and prevented\nReasoning: Cholera is an infection in the small intestine caused by the

career spanned Hong Kong and the United States.[3][4][5] He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is sometimes credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts (MMA).[6] Lee is considered by some commentators and martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West.He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and helping to change the way Chinese people were presented in American films.[7].Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a child actor by his father.However, these were not martial arts films.His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Yip Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and apparently frequent street fighting (neighbourhood and rooftop fights).In 1959, Lee moved to Seattle.In 1961, he enrolled in the University of Washington.[8] It was during this time in the United States that he began considering making money by teaching martial arts, even though he aspired to have a career in acting.He opened his first martial arts school, operated out of home in Seattle.After later adding a second school in Oakland, California, he once drew significant attention at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships of California by making demonstrations and speaking.He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to teach, where his students included Chuck Norris, Sharon Tate, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.In the 1970s, his Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the Hong Kong martial arts films to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a

pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of progressive lung disease characterized by long-term respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation.[8] The main symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath and a cough, which may or may not produce mucus.[4] COPD progressively worsens, with everyday activities such as walking or dressing becoming difficult.[3] While COPD is incurable, it is preventable and treatable.The two most common types of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis and have been the two classic COPD phenotypes.[9] Emphysema is defined as enlarged airspaces (alveoli) whose walls have broken down resulting in permanent damage to the lung tissue.Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years.Both of these conditions can exist without airflow limitation when they are not classed as COPD.Emphysema is just one of the structural abnormalities that can limit airflow and can exist without airflow limitation in a significant number of people.[10][11] Chronic bronchitis does not always result in airflow limitation but in young adults who smoke the risk of developing COPD is high.[12] Many definitions of COPD in the past included emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but these have never been included in GOLD report definitions.[8] Emphysema and chronic bronchitis remain the predominant phenotypes of COPD but there is often overlap between them and a number of other phenotypes have also been described.[9][13] COPD and asthma may coexist and converge in some individuals.[14] COPD is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation.[15].The most common cause of COPD is tobacco smoking.[16] Other risk factors include indoor and outdoor air pollution including dust, exposure to occupational irritants such as dust from grains, cadmium dust or fumes, and genetics, such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.[12][17] In developing countries, common sources of indoor air pollution are the use of coal and biomass such as wood and dry dung as fuel for cooking and heating.[18][12] The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by spirometry.[4].Most cases of COPD can be prevented by reducing exposure to risk factors such as smoking and indoor and outdoor pollutants.[19] While treatment can slow worsening, there is no conclusive evidence that any medications can change the long-term decline in lung function.[6] COPD treatments include smoking cessation, vaccinations, pulmonary rehabilitation, inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids.[6] Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy, lung volume reduction and lung transplantation.[20] In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications, antibiotics, corticosteroids and hospitalization may be needed.[21].As of 2015, COPD affected about 174.5million people (2.4% of the global population).[7] It typically occurs in males and females over the age of 35\u201340.[1][3] In 2019 it caused 3.2million deaths, 80% occurring in lower and middle income countries,[3] up from 2.4million deaths in 1990.[22][23] The number of deaths is projected to increase further because of continued exposure to risk factors and an aging population.[8] In the United States in 2010 the economic cost was put at US$32.1billion and projected to rise to US$49billion in 2020.[24] In the United Kingdom this cost is estimated at \u00a33.8 billion annually.[25].A cardinal symptom of COPD is the chronic and progressive shortness of breath which is most characteristic of the condition.Shortness of breath (breathlessness) is often the most distressing symptom responsible for the associated anxiety and level of disability experienced.[4] Symptoms of wheezing and chest tightness associated with breathlessness can be variable over the course of a day or between days and are not always present.Chest tightness often follows exertion.[4] Many people with more advanced COPD breathe through pursed lips, which can improve shortness of breath.[26] Shortness of breath is often responsible for reduced physical activity and low levels of physical activity are associated with worse outcomes.[27][28] In severe and very severe cases there may be constant tiredness, weight loss, muscle loss and anorexia.People with COPD often have increased breathlessness and frequent colds before seeking treatment.[4].\nQ: how active can one be with copd\nReasoning: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD), chronic obstructive airway disease

toss, or bags) is a lawn game popular in North America in which players or teams take turns throwing fabric bean bags at a raised, angled board with a hole in its far end.The goal of the game is to score points by either landing a bag on the board (one point) or putting a bag through the hole (three points)..The game was first described in Heyliger de Windt's 1883 patent for \"Parlor Quoits\", which displays most of the features of modern cornhole, but uses a square hole.[1] Quoits is a game similar to horseshoes, played by throwing steel rings at a metal spike.Several earlier \"parlor quoits\" patents had sought to recreate quoit gameplay in an indoor environment,[2] but De Windt's was the first to use bean bags and a slanted board with a hole as the target..He sold the rights to the game to a Massachusetts toy manufacturer which marketed a version of it under the name \"Faba Baga\".[2] Unlike modern cornhole, which has one hole and one size of bags, a Faba Baga board had two different-sized holes, worth different point values, and provided each player with one extra-large bag per round, which could score double points..In September 1974, Popular Mechanics magazine published an article written by Carolyn Farrell about a similar game called \"bean-bag bull's-eye.\"[3] Bean-bag bull's-eye was played on a board the same width of modern cornhole boards (24\"), but

including David Paul Gregg (1958) and James Russel (1965\u20131975).In particular, Gregg's patents were used as the basis of the LaserDisc specification that was co-developed between MCA and Philips after MCA purchased Gregg's patents, as well as the company he founded, Gauss Electrophysics.[3] The LaserDisc was the immediate precursor to the CD, with the primary difference being that the LaserDisc encoded information through an analog process whereas the CD used digital encoding..Key work to digitize the optical disc was performed by Toshi Doi and Kees Schouhamer Immink during 1979\u20131980, who worked on a taskforce for Sony and Philips.[4] The result was the Compact Disc Digital Audio (CD-DA), defined on 1980.The CD-ROM was later designed as an extension of the CD-DA, and adapted this format to hold any form of digital data, with an initial storage capacity of 553 MB.[5] Sony and Philips created the technical standard that defines the format of a CD-ROM in 1983,[6]

electricity , chemicals , friction , or radiation .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: A burn is an injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or ultraviolet radiation (like sunburn).[5] Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids (called scalding), solids, or fire.[9] Burns occur mainly in the home or the workplace.In the home, risks are associated with domestic kitchens, including stoves, flames, and hot liquids.[6] In the workplace, risks are associated with fire and chemical and electric burns.[6] Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors.[6] Burns can also occur as a result of self-harm or violence between people (assault).[6].Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns.[2][10] They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days.[2][10] When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn.[2] Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful.[2] Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur.[2] In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin.[2] Often there is no pain and the burnt area is stiff.[2] Healing typically does not occur on its own.[2] A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone.[2] The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.[2][11].Burns are generally preventable.[6] Treatment depends on the severity of the burn.[2] Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers.[2] Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature.[2][10] Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings.[2] It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large.[2] Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting.[2] Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling.[10] The most common complications of burns involve infection.[4] Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.[2].In 2015, fire and heat resulted in 67 million injuries.[7] This resulted in about 2.9 million hospitalizations and 176,000 deaths.[8][12] Among women in much of the world, burns are most commonly related to the use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves.[6] Among men, they are more likely a result of unsafe workplace conditions.[6] Most deaths due to burns occur in the developing world, particularly in Southeast Asia.[6] While large burns can be fatal, treatments developed since 1960 have improved outcomes, especially in children and young adults.[13] In the United States, approximately 96% of those admitted to a burn center survive their injuries.[14] The long-term outcome is related to the size of burn and the age of the person affected.[2].The characteristics of a burn depend upon its depth.Superficial burns cause pain lasting two or three days, followed by peeling of the skin over the next few days.[10][15] Individuals with more severe burns may indicate discomfort or complain of feeling pressure rather than pain.Full-thickness burns may be entirely insensitive to light touch or puncture.[15] While superficial burns are typically red in color, severe burns may be pink, white or black.[15] Burns around the mouth or singed hair inside the nose may indicate that burns to the airways have occurred, but these findings are not definitive.[16] More worrisome signs include: shortness of breath, hoarseness, and stridor or wheezing.[16] Itchiness is common during the healing process, occurring in up to 90% of adults and nearly all children.[17] Numbness or tingling may persist for a prolonged period of time after an electrical injury.[18] Burns may also produce emotional and psychological distress.[19].Burns are caused by a variety of external sources classified as thermal (heat-related), chemical, electrical, and radiation.[21] In the United States, the most common causes of burns are: fire or flame (44%), scalds (33%), hot objects (9%), electricity (4%), and chemicals (3%).[22] Most (69%) burn injuries occur at home or at work (9%),[14] and most are accidental, with 2% due to assault by another, and 1\u20132% resulting from a suicide attempt.[19] These sources can cause inhalation injury to the airway and/or lungs, occurring in about 6%.[4].Burn injuries occur more commonly among the poor.[19] Smoking and alcoholism are other risk factors.[9] Fire-related burns are generally more common in colder climates.[19] Specific risk factors in the developing world include cooking with open fires or on the floor[5] as well as developmental disabilities in children and chronic diseases in adults.[23].In the United States, fire and hot liquids are the most common causes of burns.[4] Of house fires that result in death, smoking causes 25% and heating devices cause 22%.[5] Almost half of injuries are due to efforts to fight a fire.[5] Scalding is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks, high temperature tap water in baths or showers, hot cooking oil, or steam.[25] Scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five[2] and, in the United States and Australia, this population makes up about two-thirds of all burns.[4] Contact with hot objects is the cause of about 20\u201330% of burns in children.[4] Generally, scalds are first- or second-degree burns, but third-degree burns may also result, especially with prolonged contact.[26] Fireworks are a common cause of burns during holiday seasons in many countries.[27] This is a particular risk for adolescent males.[28] In the United States, for non-fatal burn injuries to children, white males under the age of 6 comprise most cases.[29] Thermal burns from grabbing/touching and spilling/splashing were the most common type of burn and mechanism, while the bodily areas most impacted were hands and fingers followed by head/neck.[29].Chemical burns can be caused by over 25,000 substances,[2] most of which are either a strong base (55%) or a strong acid (26%).[30] Most chemical burn deaths are secondary to  ingestion.[2] Common agents include: sulfuric acid as found in toilet cleaners, sodium hypochlorite as found in bleach, and halogenated hydrocarbons as found in paint remover, among others.[2] Hydrofluoric acid can cause particularly deep burns that may not become symptomatic until some time after exposure.[31] Formic acid may cause the breakdown of significant numbers of red blood cells.[16].\nQ: how bad burns go to burn center\nReasoning: A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat , electricity , chemicals , friction , or radiation ."}, {"question_id": "Q55",

Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's five oceans, with an area of about 85,133,000km2 (32,870,000sqmi).[2] It covers approximately 17% of Earth's surface and about 24% of its water surface area.It is known to separate the \"Old World\" of Africa, Europe, and Asia from the \"New World\" of the Americas in the European perception of the World..Through its separation of Europe, Africa, and Asia from the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean has played a central role in the development of human society, globalization, and the histories of many nations.While the Norse were the first known humans to cross the Atlantic, it was the expedition of Christopher Columbus in 1492 that proved to be the most consequential.Columbus' expedition ushered in an age of exploration and colonization of the Americas by European powers, most notably Portugal, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom.From the 16th to 19th centuries, the Atlantic Ocean was the center of both an eponymous slave trade and the Columbian exchange while occasionally hosting naval battles.Such naval battles, as well as growing trade from regional American powers like the United States and Brazil, both increased in degree during the early 20th century, and while no major military conflicts took place in the Atlantic in the present day, the ocean remains a core component of trade around the world..The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Europe and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west.As one component of the interconnected World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica).The Atlantic Ocean is divided in two parts, the Northern and Southern Atlantic, by the Equator.[5].The oldest known mentions of an \"Atlantic\" sea

subtropical cyclones are named by various warning centers to simplify communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts, watches and warnings.The names are intended to reduce confusion in the event of concurrent storms in the same basin.Once storms develop sustained wind speeds of more than 33 knots (61km/h; 38mph), names are generally assigned to them from predetermined lists, depending on the basin in which they originate.Some tropical depressions are named in the Western Pacific, while tropical cyclones must contain a significant amount of gale-force

spectrum is the band of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye.Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light (or simply light)..The optical spectrum is sometimes considered to be the same as the visible spectrum, but some authors define the term more broadly, to include the ultraviolet and infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum as well.[1].A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to about 750 nanometers.[2] In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 400\u2013790terahertz.These boundaries are not sharply defined and may vary per individual.[3] Under optimal conditions these limits of human perception can extend to 310nm (ultraviolet) and 1100nm (near infrared).[4][5][6].The spectrum does not contain all the colors that the human visual system can distinguish.Unsaturated colors such as pink, or purple variations like magenta, for example, are absent because they can only be made from a mix of multiple wavelengths.Colors containing only one wavelength are also called pure colors or spectral colors.[7].Visible wavelengths pass largely unattenuated through the Earth's atmosphere via the \"optical window\" region of the electromagnetic spectrum.An example of this phenomenon is when clean air scatters blue light more than red light, and so the midday sky appears blue (apart from the area around the Sun which appears white because the light is not scattered as much).The optical window is also referred to as the \"visible window\" because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum.The near infrared (NIR) window lies just out of the human vision, as well as the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) window, and the long-wavelength or far-infrared (LWIR or

action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that removes soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust and then transports it to another location where it is deposited.Erosion is distinct from weathering which involves no movement.[1][2] Removal of rock or soil as clastic sediment is referred to as physical or mechanical erosion; this contrasts with chemical erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by dissolution.[3] Eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres, or for thousands of kilometres..Agents of erosion include rainfall;[4] bedrock wear in rivers; coastal erosion by the sea and waves; glacial plucking, abrasion, and scour; areal flooding; wind abrasion; groundwater processes; and mass movement processes in steep landscapes like landslides and debris flows.The rates at which such processes act control how fast a surface is eroded.Typically, physical erosion proceeds the fastest on steeply sloping surfaces, and rates may also be sensitive to some climatically controlled properties including amounts of water supplied (e.g., by rain), storminess, wind speed, wave fetch, or atmospheric temperature (especially for some ice-related processes).Feedbacks are also possible between rates of erosion and the amount of eroded material that is already carried by, for example, a river or glacier.[5][6] The transport of eroded materials from their original location is followed by deposition, which is arrival and emplacement of material at a new location.[1].While erosion is a natural process, human activities have increased by 10\u201340 times the rate at which soil erosion is occurring globally.[7] At agriculture sites in the Appalachian Mountains, intensive farming practices have caused erosion at up to 100 times the natural rate of erosion in the region.[8] Excessive (or accelerated) erosion causes both \"on-site\" and \"off-site\" problems.On-site impacts include decreases in agricultural productivity and (on natural landscapes) ecological collapse, both because of loss of the nutrient-rich upper soil layers.In some cases, this leads to desertification.Off-site effects include sedimentation of waterways and eutrophication of water bodies, as well as sediment-related damage to roads and houses.Water and wind erosion are the two primary causes of land degradation; combined, they are responsible for about 84% of the global extent of degraded land, making excessive erosion one of the most significant environmental problems worldwide.[9]:\u200a2\u200a[10]:\u200a1\u200a[11].Intensive agriculture, deforestation, roads, anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl are amongst the most significant human activities in regard

shell may be thought of as an orbit that electrons follow around an atom's nucleus.The closest shell to the nucleus is called the \"1 shell\" (also called the \"K shell\"), followed by the \"2 shell\" (or \"L shell\"), then the \"3 shell\" (or \"M shell\"), and so on farther and farther from the nucleus.The shells correspond to the principal quantum numbers (n = 1, 2, 3, 4...) or are labeled alphabetically with the letters used in X-ray notation (K, L, M,...).A useful guide when understanding electron shells in atoms is to note that each row on the conventional periodic table of elements represents an electron shell..Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: the first shell can hold up to two electrons, the second shell can hold up to eight (2 + 6) electrons, the third shell can hold up to 18 (2 + 6 + 10) and so on.The general formula is that the nth shell can in principle hold up to 2(n2) electrons.[1] For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells, see electron configuration.[2].Each shell consists of one or more subshells, and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals..In 1913, Bohr proposed a model of the atom, giving the arrangement of electrons in their sequential orbits.At that time, Bohr allowed the capacity of the inner orbit of the atom to increase to eight electrons as the atoms got larger, and \"in the scheme given below the number of electrons in this [outer] ring is arbitrary put equal to the normal valency of the corresponding element\".Using these and other constraints, he proposed configurations that are in accord with those now known only for the first six elements.\"From the above we are led to the following possible scheme for the arrangement of the electrons in light atoms:\"[3][4].The shell

for food; however, they may also be slaughtered for other reasons such as for harvesting of pelts, being diseased and unsuitable for consumption, or being surplus for maintaining a breeding stock.Slaughter typically involves some initial cutting, opening the major body cavities to remove the entrails and offal but usually leaving the carcass in one piece.Such dressing can be done by hunters in the field (field dressing of game) or in a slaughterhouse.Later, the carcass is usually butchered into smaller cuts..The animals most commonly slaughtered for food are cattle and water buffalo, sheep, goats,  pigs, deers, horses, poultry (mainly chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese), insects (a commercial species is the house cricket), and increasingly, fish in the aquaculture

device that suppresses the blast created when a gun (firearm or airgun) is discharged, therefore reducing the acoustic intensity of the muzzle report (sound of a gunshot) and jump, by modulating the speed and pressure of the propellant gas released from the muzzle.Like other muzzle devices, a silencer can be a detachable accessory mounted to the muzzle, or an integral part of the barrel..A typical silencer is a metallic (usually stainless steel or titanium) cylinder containing numerous internal sound baffles, with a hollow bore to allow the projectile (bullet) to exit normally.During firing, the bullet flies through the bore with little hindrance, but most of the expanding gas ejecta behind it is redirected through a longer and convoluted escape path created by the baffles, prolonging the release time.This slows down the gas and dissipates its kinetic energy into a larger surface area, reducing the blast intensity, thus lowering the loudness.[1].Silencers can also reduce the recoil during shooting, but unlike a muzzle brake or a recoil compensator, which reduce recoil by vectoring the muzzle blast sideways, silencers release almost all the gases towards the front.However, the internal baffles significantly prolong the time of the gas release and therefore decrease the rearward thrust generated \u2014 as for the same impulse, force is inversely proportional to time.The weight of the silencer itself and the leverage of its mounting location (at the far front end of the barrel) will also help counter muzzle rise..Because the internal baffles will slow and cool the released gas and contain gunpowder that is still burning upon exit from the muzzle, silencers also reduce or even eliminate the muzzle flash.This is different from a flash suppressor, which reduces the amount of flash by dispersing burning gases that are already released outside the muzzle, without necessarily reducing sound or recoil.A flash hider, or muzzle shroud, on the other hand, conceals visible flashes by screening them from the direct line of sight, rather than reducing the intensity of the flash..In 1892 a Swiss inventor called Jakob Stahel patented a silencer intended for killing cattle though he claimed it could be adapted to other firearms too.[2].\nQ: how a silencer works\nReasoning: Several firearms with detachable suppressors, from top to

for food continue to the modern era, with entirely separate breeds that focus on size and disease resistance..With the export of guinea pigs to Europe in the 15th century, the goal in breeding shifted to focus on the development of appealing pets.To this end, various competitive breeding organizations were founded by fanciers.The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the American Rabbit Breeders Association, is the governing body in the United States and Canada.[2][3] The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom.[4] For Australia and New Zealand, there are the Australian National Cavy Council and the New Zealand Cavy Council.[5][6] Each club publishes its own \"standard of perfection\" and determines which breeds are eligible for showing.New breeds are continuously emerging, which may or may not be recognized by these breeding organizations..Though there are many breeds of guinea pig, only a few found on the show table are common as pets.Most pet guinea pigs were either found undesirable by breeders,[clarification needed] or else were bred to be pleasant pets regardless of how well they met the \"standard of perfection\" for the breed.The

transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which enter the ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain via an anti-codon stem loop.For each coding triplet (codon) in the messenger RNA, there is a unique transfer RNA that must have the exact anti-codon match, and carries the correct amino acid for incorporating into a growing polypeptide chain.Once the protein is produced, it can then fold to produce a functional three-dimensional structure..A ribosome is made from complexes of RNAs and proteins and is therefore a ribonucleoprotein complex.Each ribosome is composed of small (30S) and large (50S)

"Context: The Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions, bio synthetic phase, dark reactions, or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle[1] of photosynthesis is a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and hydrogen-carrier compounds into glucose.The Calvin cycle is present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and also many photosynthetic bacteria.In plants, these reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled region of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes.These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them.The Calvin cycle  uses the chemical energy of ATP and reducing power of NADPH from the light dependent reactions to produce sugars for the plant to use.These substrates are used in a series of reduction-oxidation reactions to produce sugars in a step-wise process; there is no direct reaction that converts several molecules of CO2 to a sugar.There are three phases to the light-independent reactions, collectively called the Calvin cycle: carboxylation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration..Though it is called the \"dark reaction\", the Calvin cycle does not actually occur in the dark or during night time.This is because the process requires NADPH, which is short-lived and comes from the light-dependent reactions.In the dark, plants instead release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves to provide energy for the plant.The Calvin cycle thus happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis (C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation, and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM)); CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day to make this process work.[2].The reactions of the Calvin cycle are closely coupled to the thylakoid electron transport chain as the energy required to reduce the carbon dioxide is provided by NADPH produced during the light dependent reactions.\nQ: what happens  to the light independent reactions of photosynthesis?\nReasoning: The simplified internal structure of a chloroplast"}, {"question_id": "Q101", "question": "How Do You

Good Feelings marked a period in the political history of the United States that reflected a sense of national purpose and a desire for unity among Americans in the aftermath of the  War of 1812.[1][2] The era saw the collapse of the Federalist Party and an end to the bitter partisan disputes between it and the dominant Democratic-Republican Party during the First Party System.[3][4] President James Monroe strove to downplay partisan affiliation in making his nominations, with the ultimate goal of national unity and eliminating political parties altogether from national politics.[1][5][6] The period is so closely associated with Monroe's presidency (1817\u20131825) and his administrative goals that his name and the era are virtually synonymous.[7].During and after the 1824 presidential election, the Democratic-Republican Party split between supporters and opponents of Jacksonian Democracy, leading to the Second Party System..The designation of the period by historians as one of good feelings is often conveyed with irony or skepticism, as the history of the era was one in which the political atmosphere was strained and divisive, especially among factions within the Monroe administration and the Democratic-Republican Party.[3][8][9].The phrase Era of Good Feelings was coined by Benjamin Russell in the Boston Federalist newspaper Columbian Centinel on July 12, 1817, following Monroe's visit to Boston, Massachusetts, as part of his good-will tour of the United States.[7][10][11].The Era of Good Feelings started in 1815 at the end of the War of 1812.[2] Exultation replaced the bitter political divisions between Federalists and Republicans, the North and South, and the East Coast cities and settlers on the American frontier.The political hostilities declined because the Federalist Party had largely dissolved after the fiasco of the Hartford Convention in 1814\u201315.[12] As a party, Federalists \"had collapsed as a national political force\".[13][14][15] The Democratic-Republican Party was nominally dominant, but in practice it was inactive at the national level and in most states.[16].The era saw a trend toward national institutions that envisioned \"a permanent federal role in the crucial arena of national development and national prosperity\".[17] Monroe's predecessor, President James Madison, and the Republican Party, had come to appreciate \u2013 through the crucible of war \u2013 the expediency of Federalist institutions and projects, and prepared to legislate them under the auspices of John C.Calhoun and Henry Clay's American System.[18][19][20][21].Madison announced this shift in policy with his Seventh Annual Message to Congress in December 1815, subsequently authorizing measures for a national bank and a protective tariff on manufactures.[22] Vetoing the Bonus Bill on strict constructionist grounds, Madison nevertheless was determined, as had been his predecessor, Thomas Jefferson,[23] to see internal improvements implemented with an amendment to the US Constitution.[24][25] Writing to Monroe, in 1817, Madison declared that \"there has never been a moment when such a proposition to the states was so likely to be approved\".[26].The emergence of \"new Republicans\" \u2013 undismayed by mild nationalist policies \u2013 anticipated Monroe's \"era of good feelings\" and a general mood of optimism emerged with hopes for political reconciliation.[27].Monroe's landslide victory against Federalist Rufus King in the 1816 presidential election was so widely predicted that voter turnout was low.[28][29] A spirit of reconciliation between Republicans and Federalists was well underway when Monroe assumed office in March 1817.[3][30].As president, Monroe was widely expected to facilitate a rapprochement of the political parties in order to harmonize the country in a common national outlook, rather than party interests.\nQ: what ended the era of good feelings\nReasoning: The

applying a seal which had to be broken to open the container (hence the modern English verb \"to seal\", which implies secure closing without an actual wax seal)..The seal-making device is also referred to as the seal matrix or die; the imprint it creates as the seal impression (or, more rarely, the sealing).[1] If the impression is made purely as a relief resulting from the greater pressure on the paper where the high parts of the matrix touch, the seal is known as a dry seal; in other cases ink or another liquid or liquefied medium is used, in another color than the paper..In most traditional forms of dry seal the design on the seal matrix is in intaglio (cut below the flat surface) and therefore the design on the impressions made is in relief (raised above the surface).The design on the impression will reverse (be a mirror-image of) that of the matrix, which is especially important when script is included in the design, as it very often is.This will not be the case if paper is embossed from behind, where the matrix and impression read the same way, and both matrix and impression are in relief.However engraved gems were often carved in relief, called cameo in this context, giving a \"counter-relief\" or intaglio impression when used as seals.The process is essentially that of a mould..Most seals have always given a single impression on an essentially flat surface, but in medieval Europe two-sided seals with two matrices were often used by institutions or rulers (such as towns, bishops and kings) to make two-sided or fully three-dimensional impressions in wax, with a \"tag\", a piece of ribbon or strip of parchment, running through them.These \"pendent\" seal impressions dangled below the documents they authenticated, to which the attachment tag was sewn or otherwise attached (single-sided seals were treated in the same way)..Some jurisdictions consider rubber stamps[2] or specified signature-accompanying words such as \"seal\" or \"L.S.\"

precipitation falls in the months of June through September.The area is listed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as being in hardiness zone 9b as well as hardiness zone 10a just along the immediate coast and in peninsular Pinellas;[1] which is about the northern limit of where coconut palms and royal palms can be grown.Highs usually range between 65 and 95\u00b0F

photon energies..It covers electromagnetic waves with frequencies ranging from below one hertz to above 1025 hertz, corresponding to wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus.This range is divided into separate bands, and the electromagnetic waves within each band are called by different names; beginning at the low-frequency (long-wavelength) end of the spectrum these are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays at the high-frequency (short wavelength) end..The electromagnetic waves in each of these bands have different characteristics, such as how they are produced, how they interact with matter, and their practical applications.There is no known limit for long and short wavelengths.Extreme ultraviolet, soft X-rays, hard X-rays and gamma rays are  classified as ionizing radiation because their photons have enough energy to ionize atoms, causing chemical reactions.Radiation of visible light and longer wavelengths are classified as nonionizing radiation because they have insufficient energy to cause these effects..Throughout most of the electromagnetic spectrum, spectroscopy can be used to separate waves of different frequencies, producing a spectrum of the constituent frequencies.Spectroscopy is used to study the interactions of electromagnetic waves with matter.[1].Humans have always been aware of visible light and radiant heat but for most of history it was not known that these phenomena were connected or were representatives of a more

air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature..Clouds are seen in the Earth's homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere.Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common name..Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names because of the universal adoption of Luke Howard's nomenclature that was formally proposed in 1802.It became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms which can be further divided or classified into altitude levels to derive ten basic genera.The main representative cloud types for each of these forms are stratiform, cumuliform, stratocumuliform, cumulonimbiform, and cirriform.Low-level  clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes.However mid-level stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix alto- while high-level variants of these same two forms carry the prefix cirro-.In both cases, strato- is dropped from the latter form to avoid double-prefixing.Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one

compositional techniques, in which, \"the importance of individual pitches\", is minimized, \"in preference for texture, timbre, and dynamics as primary shapers of gesture and impact\", obscuring, \"the boundary between sound and noise\".[2].Techniques which may create or be used with sound mass include extended techniques such as muted brass or strings, flutter tonguing, wide vibrato, extreme ranges, and glissandos as the continuum for \"sound mass\" moves from simultaneously sounding notes \u2013 clusters etc., towards stochastic cloud textures, and 'mass structure' compositional textures which evolve over time.[2] In a sound mass, \"the traditional concept of 'chord' or vertical 'event' [is] replaced by a shifting, iridescent fabric of sound\".[3].The use of \"chords approaching timbres\" begins with Debussy and Edgard Var\u00e8se often carefully scored individual instrumental parts so that they would fuse into one ensemble timbre or sound mass.[4] Explored by Charles Ives and Henry Cowell in the early part of the twentieth century, this technique also developed from the modernist tone clusters and spread to orchestral writing by the mid 1950s and 1960s.[2] \"Unlike most tonal and non-tonal linear dissonances, tone clusters are essentially static.The individual pitches are of secondary importance; it is the sound mass that is foremost.\"[5] One French composer active in this period whose music takes a sound-mass approach directly influenced by both Debussy and Var\u00e8se is Maurice Ohana.[6].Examples can be found in Metastasis (1953\u201354), Pithoprakta (1955\u201356), and Achorripsis (1956\u201357), all orchestral works by Iannis Xenakis,[7] as well as in Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge for concrete and electronic sounds (1955\u201356), Zeitma\u00dfe for five woodwinds (1955\u201356), and Gruppen for three orchestras (1955\u201357), by Karlheinz Stockhausen.[8] Other composers and works include Barbara Kolb, Pauline Oliveros' Sound Patterns for chorus (1961), Norma Beecroft's From Dreams of Brass for chorus (1963\u201364), and Nancy Van de Vate.Beecroft \"blurs individual pitches in favor of a collective timbre through the use of vocal and instrumental clusters, choral speech, narrator, and a wash of sounds from an electronic tape\".[2].A very early example is the opening of Jean-F\u00e9ry Rebel's ballet Les El\u00e9mens (1737\u201338), where chaos is represented by a gradually cumulating orchestral cluster of all seven notes of the D minor scale.[9] A later example is the third movement of Ruth Crawford Seeger's String Quartet 1931[10][citation needed] while more recently Phill Niblock's multiple drone based music serves as an example.[11].Other examples include European \"textural\" compositions of the fifties and sixties such as Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1959) and Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's works featuring micropolyphony in works like Atmosph\u00e8res (1961) and his Requiem (1963\u201365).[12] Other composers with works using this technique include Henryk G\u00f3recki, Karel Husa, Witold Lutos\u0142awski, Kazimierz Serocki, Steven Stucky, and George Crumb.[12] Sound-mass

an end to the Second Red Scare.[4][5][6] Historians have suggested since the 1980s that as McCarthy's involvement was less central than that of others, a different and more accurate term should be used instead that more accurately conveys the breadth of the phenomenon, and that the term McCarthyism is now outdated.Ellen Schrecker has suggested that Hooverism after FBI Head J.Edgar Hoover is more appropriate.[7].What would become known as the McCarthy era began before McCarthy's rise to national fame.Following the breakdown of the wartime East-West alliance with the Soviet Union, and with many remembering the First Red Scare, President Harry S.Truman signed an executive order in 1947 to screen federal employees for possible association with organizations deemed \"totalitarian, fascist, communist, or subversive\", or advocating \"to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means.\" The following year, the Czechoslovak coup by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia heightened concern in the West about Communist parties seizing power and the possibility of subversion.In 1949, a high-level State Department official was convicted of perjury in a case of espionage, and the Soviet Union tested a nuclear bomb.The Korean War started the next year, significantly raising tensions and fears of impending communist upheavals in the United States.In a speech in February 1950, McCarthy claimed to have a list of members of the Communist Party USA working in the State Department, which attracted substantial press attention, and the term McCarthyism was published for the first time in late March of that year in The Christian Science Monitor, along with a political cartoon by Herblock in The Washington Post.The term has since taken on a broader meaning, describing the excesses of similar efforts to crack down on alleged \"subversive\" elements.\nQ: What did the hollywood blacklist have to do with McCarthy\nReasoning: A 1947 propaganda comic

Napoleon calls in the dogs he has raised to chase Snowball from the farm.This is the first time the dogs have been seen since Napoleon took them in and raised them to act as his secret police..Later on, after ostracising Snowball, Napoleon orders the construction of the windmill, which had been designed by Snowball and which Napoleon had opposed vigorously (just as Stalin opposed Trotsky's push for large scale industrialisation, then adopted it as a policy when Trotsky was in exile), so as to show the animals that he could be just as inventive as Snowball.The other animals are told it was Napoleon's ideas and that Snowball had stolen it.When the primitive windmill collapses after a storm, due to Napoleon's poor planning (a reference to Stalin's backward approach to the Five-Year

movement, which, according to Latter Day Saint theology, contains writings of ancient prophets who lived on the American continent from 600 BC to AD 421 and during an interlude dated by the text to the unspecified time of the Tower of Babel.[1][2] It was first published in March 1830 by Joseph Smith as The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.[3][4] The Book of Mormon is one of the earliest and most well known unique writings of the Latter Day Saint movement.The denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement typically regard the text primarily as scripture (sometimes as one of four standard works) and secondarily as a record of God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas.[5] The majority of Latter Day Saints believe the book to be a record of real-world history, with Latter Day Saint denominations viewing it variously as an inspired record of scripture to the lynchpin or \"keystone\" of their religion.[6] Some Latter Day Saint academics and apologetic organizations strive to affirm the book as historically authentic through their scholarship and research,[7] but mainstream archaeological, historical, and scientific communities have discovered little to support the existence of the civilizations described therein, and do not consider it to be an actual record of historical events.[8].According to Smith's account and the book's narrative, the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as \"reformed Egyptian\"[9] engraved on golden plates.Smith said that the last prophet to contribute to the book, a man named Moroni, buried it in the Hill Cumorah in present-day Manchester, New York, before his death, and then appeared in a vision to Smith in 1827 as an angel, revealing the location of the plates and instructing him to translate the plates into English.[2] Most naturalistic views on the origins of the Book of Mormon hold that Smith authored it, drawing, whether consciously or subconsciously, on material and ideas from his contemporary 19th-century environment, rather than translating an ancient record.[10][11].The Book of Mormon has a number of doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of Adam and Eve,[12] the nature of the Christian atonement,[13] eschatology, agency, priesthood authority, redemption from physical and spiritual death,[14] the nature and conduct of baptism, the age of accountability, the purpose and practice of communion, personalized revelation, economic justice, the anthropomorphic and personal nature of God, the nature of spirits and angels, and the organization of the latter day church.The pivotal event of the book is an appearance of Jesus Christ in the Americas shortly after his resurrection.[15] Common teachings of the Latter Day Saint movement hold that the Book of Mormon fulfills numerous biblical prophecies by ending a global apostasy and signaling a restoration of Christian gospel.The book is also a critique of Western society, condemning immorality, individualism, social inequality, ethnic injustice, nationalism, and the rejection of God, revelation, and miraculous religion.[16].The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books, titled after individuals named as primary authors or other caretakers of the ancient record the Book of Mormon describes itself as and, in most versions, is divided into chapters and verses.[17] Its English text imitates the style of the King James Version of the Bible,[17] and its grammar and word choice reflect Early Modern English.[18] The Book of Mormon has been fully or partially translated into at least 112 languages.[19].According to Joseph Smith, in 1823, when he was seventeen years old, an angel of God named Moroni appeared to him and said that a collection of ancient writings was buried in a nearby hill in present-day Wayne County, New York, engraved on golden plates by ancient prophets.[20][21] The writings were said to describe a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western hemisphere 600 years before Jesus's birth.[2] (This \"angel Moroni\" figure also appears in the Book of Mormon as the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days.) Smith said this vision occurred on the evening of September 21, 1823, and that on the following day, via divine guidance, he located the burial location of the plates on this hill and was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the same hill on September 22 of the following year to receive further instructions, which repeated annually for the next three years.[22][23] Smith told his entire immediate family about this angelic encounter by the next night, and his brother William reported that the family \"believed all he [Joseph Smith] said\" about the angel and plates.[24].Smith and his family reminisced that as part of what Smith believed was angelic instruction, Moroni provided Smith with a \"brief sketch\" of the \"origin, progress, civilization, laws, governments...righteousness and iniquity\" of the \"aboriginal inhabitants of the country\" (referring to the Nephites and Lamanites who figure in the Book of Mormon's primary narrative).Smith sometimes shared what he believed he had learned through such angelic encounters with his family in what his mother Lucy Mack Smith called \"most amusing recitals\".[25].\nQ: what edition of book of mormon had 103 sections\nReasoning:

(these are what is usually being referred to as \"the ARIA awards\") as well as Fine Arts Awards and Artisan Awards (held separately from 2004), Achievement Awards and ARIA Hall of Fame \u2013 the latter were held separately from 2005 to 2010 but returned to the general ceremony in 2011.For 2010, ARIA introduced public voted awards for the first time..Winning, or even being nominated for, an ARIA award results in a lot of media attention and publicity on an artist, and usually increases recording sales several-fold, as well as chart significance \u2013 in 2005, for example, after Ben Lee won three awards, his album Awake Is the New Sleep jumped from No.31 to No.5 in the ARIA Charts, its highest position.In October 1995 singer-songwriter Tina Arena became the first woman to win Album of the Year for Don't Ask (1994) and Song of the Year for \"Chains\".Before the ceremony the album had achieved 3\u00d7 platinum (for shipment of 210,000 copies) and by year's end it was 8\u00d7 platinum (560,000 copies) and had topped the end of year albums chart.[2][third-party source needed].In 1983, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) was established by the six major record companies then operating in Australia, EMI, Festival Records, CBS (now known as Sony Music), RCA (now known as BMG), WEA (now known as Warner Music) and PolyGram (now known as Universal) replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956.[3] It later included smaller record companies representing independent acts/labels and has over 100 members.[3].Australian TV pop music show Countdown presented its own annual awards ceremony, Countdown Music and Video Awards, which were co-produced by Carolyn James (also known as Carolyn Bailey) from 1981 to 1984 and, in the latter two years, in collaboration with ARIA.[4][5][6] ARIA provided peer voting for some awards, while Countdown provided coupons in the related Countdown Magazine for viewers to vote for populist awards.[7] At the 1985 Countdown awards ceremony, held on 14 April 1986, fans of INXS and Uncanny X-Men scuffled during the broadcast and as a result ARIA decided to hold their own awards.[6] Australian music journalist, Anthony O'Grady, described the fans of Uncanny X-Men, \"screeching dismay and derision every time their heroes were denied a prize.Finally, when INXS were announced Best Group and Michael Hutchence walked towards the stage, X-Men fans unfurled a 2-metre banner reading: '@*l! OFF POCK FACE'.\"[8].After that ceremony ARIA withdrew their support for the Countdown awards.Meanwhile, four music industry representatives had met in Sydney: a talent manager Peter Rix and three record company executives Brian Harris, Peter Ikin and Gil Robert.Rix summarised the outcome, \"the industry deserved a peer-voting Awards night and it needed to be sanctioned by\" ARIA.[8] Its \"primary purpose was to strive for some sort of objective overview of excellence in recording.\"[8] Rather than the ARIA board pay the entire cost of the event, \"we cooked up a scheme whereby the ARIA Awards would be funded by individual record companies buying tickets for a dinner.\"[8] Rix and his group approached ARIA board members, Paul Turner (also managing director of WEA) and Brian

the amendment prohibits affected individuals from succeeding to the presidency under any circumstances or whether it applies only to presidential elections.Until the amendment's ratification, the president had not been subject to term limits, but both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson (the first and third presidents) decided not to serve a third term, establishing the two-term

a water environment.Possible reasons for dredging include improving existing water features; reshaping land and water features to alter drainage, navigability, and commercial use; constructing dams, dikes, and other controls for streams and shorelines; and recovering valuable mineral deposits or marine life having commercial value.In all but a few situations the excavation is undertaken by a specialist floating plant, known as a dredger..Usually the main objectives of dredging is to recover material of value or use, or to create a greater depth of water.[1] Dredging systems can either be shore-based, brought to a location based on barges, or built into purpose built vessels..Dredging has significant environmental impacts: it can disturb marine sediments, leading to both short- and long-term water pollution, destroy important seabed ecosystems, and can release legacy human-sourced toxins captured in the sediment.These environmental impacts can significantly hurt marine wildlife populations, contaminate sources of drinking water and interrupt economic activities such as fishing..Dredging is excavation carried out underwater or partially underwater, in shallow waters or ocean waters.It keeps waterways and ports navigable, and assists coastal protection, land reclamation and coastal redevelopment, by gathering up bottom sediments and transporting it elsewhere.Dredging can be done to recover materials of commercial value; these may be high value minerals or sediments such as sand and gravel that are used by the construction industry.[2].Dredging is a four-part process: loosening the material, bringing the material to the surface (together extraction), transportation and disposal.[1].The extract can be disposed of locally or transported by barge or in a liquid suspension in pipelines.Disposal can be to infill sites, or the material can be used constructively to replenish eroded sand that has been lost to coastal erosion, or constructively create sea-walls,

comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.[b] Star Wars is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time..The original 1977 film, retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope, was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy.Lucas later returned to the series to write and direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005).In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise.This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)..All nine films, collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\", were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to the first two releases.Together with the theatrical live action \"anthology\" films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10billion, making Star Wars the third-highest-grossing film franchise of all time..The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\"[3] across multiple fictional eras, in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to in the films as 'droids'), which may be programmed for personal assistance or battle.[4] Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology.[5][6][7] The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes.Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a Star Wars planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life.[8] The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae.[9][10] Spacecraft range from small starfighters to large capital ships, such as the Star Destroyers, as well as space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars.[11][12][13] Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections and hyperspace transmission.[14].The universe of Star Wars is generally similar to the real universe but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative stories.[15] One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as \"an energy field created by all living things ...[that] binds the galaxy together\".[16] The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god.[17] Through training and meditation, those whom \"the Force is strong with\" exhibit various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).[18] It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force.[19] The mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression.[20][21] While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or

platelets, which is performed by a device used in blood donation that separates the platelets and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.Platelet transfusion can be a life-saving procedure in preventing or treating serious complications from bleeding and hemorrhage in patients who have disorders manifesting as thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) or platelet dysfunction.This process may also be used therapeutically to treat disorders resulting in extraordinarily high platelet counts such as essential thrombocytosis..Platelet transfusions are traditionally given to patients undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia, multiple myeloma, those with aplastic anemia, AIDS, hypersplenism, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), sepsis, bone marrow transplant, radiation treatment, organ transplant or surgeries such as cardiopulmonary bypass.Platelet transfusions should be avoided in those with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) because it can worsen neurologic symptoms and acute renal failure, presumably due to creation of new thrombi as the platelets are consumed.It should also be avoided in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).[citation needed].In adults, platelets are recommended in those who have levels less than 10,000/\u00b5L, or less than 20,000/\u00b5L if a central venous catheter is being placed, or less than 50,000/\u00b5L if a lumbar puncture or major surgery is required.[1].Not all platelet transfusions use platelets collected by automated apheresis.The platelets can also be separated from donations of whole blood collected in a traditional blood donation, but there are several advantages to separating the platelets at the time of collection.The first advantage is that the whole-blood platelets, sometimes called \"random\" platelets, from a single donation are not numerous enough for a dose to give to an adult patient.They must be pooled from several donors to create a single transfusion, and this complicates processing and increases the risk of diseases that can be spread in transfused blood, such as human immunodeficiency virus.[citation needed].\nQ: how

been called the \"father of English literature\", or, alternatively, the \"father of English poetry\".[2]  He was the first writer to be buried in what has since come to be called Poets' Corner, in Westminster Abbey.[3] Chaucer also gained fame as a philosopher and astronomer, composing the scientific A Treatise on the Astrolabe for his 10-year-old son Lewis.He maintained a career in the civil service as a bureaucrat, courtier, diplomat, and member of parliament..Among Chaucer's many other works are The Book of the Duchess, The House of Fame, The Legend of Good Women, and Troilus and Criseyde.He is seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of Middle English when the dominant literary languages in England were still Anglo-Norman French and Latin.[4] Chaucer's contemporary Thomas Hoccleve hailed him as \"the firste fyndere of our fair langage\" (i.e., the first one capable of finding poetic matter in English).[5][6] Almost two thousand English words are first attested to in Chaucerian manuscripts..Chaucer was born in London most likely in the early 1340s (by some accounts, including his monument, he was born in 1343), though the precise date and location remain unknown.The Chaucer family offers an extraordinary example of upward mobility.His great-grandfather was a tavern keeper, his grandfather worked as a purveyor of wines, and his father John Chaucer rose to become an important wine merchant with a royal appointment.[7] Several previous generations of Geoffrey Chaucer's family had been vintners[8][9] and merchants in Ipswich.[10] His family name is derived from the French chaucier, once thought to mean 'shoemaker', but now known to mean a maker of hose or leggings.[11].In 1324, his father John Chaucer was kidnapped by an aunt in the hope of marrying the 12-year-old to her daughter in an attempt to keep the property in Ipswich.The aunt was imprisoned and fined \u00a3250, now equivalent to about \u00a3200,000, which suggests that the family was financially secure.[12].John Chaucer married Agnes Copton, who inherited properties in 1349, including 24 shops in London from her uncle Hamo de Copton, who is described in a will dated 3April 1354 and listed in the City Hustings Roll as \"moneyer\", said to be a moneyer at the Tower of London.In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, dated June 1380, Chaucer refers to himself as me Galfridum Chaucer, filium Johannis Chaucer, Vinetarii, Londonie, which translates as: \"I, Geoffrey Chaucer, son of the vintner John Chaucer, London\".[13].While records concerning the lives of his contemporaries William Langland and the Gawain Poet are practically non-existent, since Chaucer was a public servant his official life is very well documented, with nearly five hundred written items

January 14, the depth of snow on the ground peaked at 29 inches (74cm).[3] The blizzard lasted for a total of 38 hours.At its peak, wind gusts reached speeds of  39 miles (63km) per hour.[4]  Five people died during the blizzard, with approximately 15 others seriously injured due to conditions created by the storm.One of the five deaths came when a snowplow driver went berserk, hitting 34 cars and ramming a man.[3].O'Hare Airport was closed and all flights were grounded for 96 hours, from January 13 to 15.[3] The cold weather and snowfall throughout the rest of January and February resulted in frozen tracks throughout the Chicago 'L' system.[3] Consequently, commuters overwhelmed the capacity of CTA buses, causing bus commutes that normally would have taken 30 to 45 minutes to take up to several hours.To avoid huge snowdrifts in the streets, the overcrowded buses were obliged to take numerous detours, adding additional time to the commute.[citation needed].Snow remained on the ground until March 6, a full fifty-one days.[4] Deployment of plows was significantly delayed, and when they finally appeared they struggled to keep up with the snowfall.Much of the snow remained unmoved throughout the next two months, causing ongoing public transit delays and significant problems with trash collection.The city's inadequate response to the blizzard was blamed primarily on mayor

trade.Many New World species kept as pets have setae known as urticating hairs that can cause irritation to the skin, and in extreme cases, cause damage to the eyes.[4].Like all arthropods, the tarantula is an invertebrate that relies on an exoskeleton for muscular support.[5] Like other Arachnida, a tarantula's body comprises two main parts, the prosoma (or cephalothorax) and the opisthosoma (or abdomen).The prosoma and opisthosoma are connected by the pedicel, or pregenital somite.This waist-like connecting piece is actually part of the prosoma and gives the opisthosoma a wide range of motion relative to the prosoma..Depending on the species, the body length of tarantulas ranges from about 5 to 11cm (2 to 4+1\u20442in)[6] with leg spans of 8\u201330cm

and also more than nuclear power.[3] Hydropower can provide large amounts of low-carbon electricity on demand, making it a key element for creating secure and clean electricity supply systems.[3] A hydroelectric power station that has a dam and reservoir is a flexible source, since the amount of electricity produced can be increased or decreased in seconds or minutes in response to varying electricity demand.Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, it produces no direct waste, and almost always emits considerably less greenhouse gas than fossil fuel-powered energy plants.[4] However, when constructed in lowland rainforest areas, where part of the forest is inundated, substantial amounts of greenhouse gases may be emitted.[5].Construction of a hydroelectric complex can have significant environmental impact, principally in loss of arable land and population displacement.[6][7] They also disrupt the natural ecology of the river involved, affecting habitats and ecosystems, and siltation and erosion patterns.While dams can ameliorate the risks of flooding, dam failure can be catastrophic..In 2021, global installed hydropower electrical capacity reached almost 1400 GW, the highest among all renewable energy technologies.[8] Hydroelectricity plays a leading role in countries like Brazil, Norway and China.[9] but there are geographical limits and environmental issues.[10] Tidal power can be used in coastal regions..Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks.In the late 18th century hydraulic power

Jewish practice since Biblical times and, as part of the eucharist commemorating Jesus's Last Supper, became even more essential to the Christian Church.[20] Although Islam nominally forbade the production or consumption of wine, during its Golden Age, alchemists such as Geber pioneered wine's distillation for medicinal and industrial purposes such as the production of perfume.[21].Wine production and consumption increased, burgeoning from the 15th century onwards as part of European expansion.Despite the devastating 1887 phylloxera louse infestation, modern science and technology adapted and industrial wine production and wine consumption now occur throughout the world..The origins of wine predate written records, and modern archaeology is still uncertain about the details of the first cultivation of wild grapevines.It has been hypothesized that early humans climbed trees to pick berries, liked their sugary flavor, and then began collecting them.After a few days with fermentation setting in, juice at the bottom of any container would begin producing low-alcohol wine.According to this theory, things changed around 10,000\u20138000 BC with the transition from a

of Africa in ancient times, as they were in much of the rest of the ancient world.[1] When the trans-Saharan slave trade, Indian Ocean slave trade and Atlantic slave trade (which started in the 16th century) began, many of the pre-existing local African slave systems began supplying captives for slave markets outside Africa.[2][3] Slavery in contemporary Africa is still practiced despite it being illegal..In the relevant literature African slavery is categorized into indigenous slavery and export slavery, depending on whether or not slaves were traded beyond the continent.[4].Slavery in historical Africa was practised in many different forms: Debt slavery, enslavement of war captives, military slavery, slavery for prostitution, and enslavement of criminals were all practised in various parts of Africa.[5] Slavery for domestic and court purposes was widespread throughout Africa.Plantation slavery also occurred, primarily on the eastern coast of Africa and in parts of West Africa.The importance of domestic plantation slavery increased during the 19th century, due to the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade.Many African states dependent on the international slave trade reoriented their economies towards legitimate commerce worked by slave labour.[6].Multiple forms of slavery and servitude have existed throughout African history, and were shaped by indigenous practices of slavery as well as the Roman institution of slavery (and the later Christian views on slavery), the Islamic institutions of slavery via the Muslim slave trade, and eventually the Atlantic slave trade.[2] Slavery was a part of the economic structure of African societies for many centuries, although the extent varied.[2] Ibn Battuta, who visited the ancient kingdom of Mali in the mid-14th century, recounts that the local inhabitants vied with each other in the number of slaves and servants they had, and was himself given a slave boy as a \"hospitality gift.\"[7] In sub-Saharan Africa, the slave relationships were often complex, with rights and freedoms given to individuals held in slavery and restrictions on sale and treatment by their masters.[8] Many communities had hierarchies between different types of slaves: for example, differentiating between those who had been born into slavery and those who had been captured through war.[9].\"The slaves in Africa, I suppose, are nearly in the proportion of three to one to the freemen.They claim no reward for their services except food and clothing, and are treated with kindness or severity, according to the good or bad disposition of their masters.Custom, however, has established certain rules with regard to the treatment of slaves, which it is thought dishonourable to violate.Thus the domestic slaves, or such as are born in a man\u2019s own house, are treated with more lenity than those which are purchased with money.\nQ: how did the african slave trade affect africans in terms of economy\nReasoning:

inside a magic circle..In the traditional system of Gardnerian magic, there was as an established idea of covens which were groups composed of initiated members that conducted rituals involving magical tools and secret books (Book of Shadows).These tools were predominately kept within a specific coven because they were considered sacred.These items were owned and used by individual Wiccans, but could also be used collectively by the coven..This practice may derive partly from Masonic traditions (such as the use of the Square and Compasses), from which Wicca draws some material,[2] and partly from the rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.The latter made much use of material from medieval grimoires such as the Key of Solomon, which has many illustrations of magical tools and instructions for their preparation.[3].In Wicca, magical tools are used during rituals which both honour the deities and work magic.The general idea is that the tool directs psychic energies to perform a certain action..In modern-day Wicca, there is an encouragement of solitary practice of rituals and study.Covens are still a part of Wicca and related doctrines but there is now insistence that solitary practice is permissible.The allowance of solitary practice is clearly an important factor in terms of the growth of adherents, as the requirement to join a coven would involve

production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which contains energy.Cellular respiration may be described as a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from nutrients into ATP, and then release waste products.[1].Cellular respiration is a vital process that happens in the cells of living organisms, including humans, plants, and animals.It's how cells produce energy to power all the activities necessary for life..The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, producing large amounts of energy (ATP).Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity.The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions.Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it is an unusual one because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions..Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent is molecular oxygen (O2).The chemical energy stored in ATP (the bond of its third phosphate group to the rest of the molecule can be broken allowing more stable products to form, thereby releasing energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes..Aerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP.Although carbohydrates, fats and proteins  are consumed as reactants, aerobic respiration is the preferred method of pyruvate production in glycolysis, and requires pyruvate to the mitochondria in

including Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islanders, whose data are published separately from American Indians and Alaska Natives\".[4] The US census tracks data from American Indians and Alaska Native separately from Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islanders,[4] who include Samoan Americans and Chamorros..The European colonization of the Americas that began in 1492 resulted in a precipitous decline in Native American population because of newly introduced diseases (including weaponized diseases and biological warfare by European colonizers[5][6][7][8][9]), wars, ethnic cleansing, and enslavement.After its formation, the United States, as part of its policy of settler colonialism, continued to wage war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples, removed them from their ancestral lands, and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies.These later focused on forced assimilation, into the 20th century.[10][11][12].When the United States was created, established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations, as they generally lived in communities separate from white settlers.The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent Native nations, and started treating them as \"domestic dependent nations\" subject to applicable federal laws.This law did preserve the rights and privileges agreed to under the treaties, including a large degree of tribal

Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east.Following the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus' voyages to the Americas, Spain began to colonize the Americas.From 1609 to 1821, the majority of Central American territories (except for what would become Belize and Panama, and including the modern Mexican state of Chiapas) were governed by the

coincided with the colonial invasion and beginning of the frontier wars in what came to be known as New South Wales in 1788..The Christian footprint in Australian society and culture remains broad, particularly in areas of social welfare and education provision and in the marking of festivals such as Easter and Christmas.Though the Australian Constitution of 1901 protects freedom of religion and separation of church and state, the Church of England held legal privileges in the early colonial period, when Catholicism in particular was suppressed, and sectarianism was a feature of Australian politics well into the 20th century, as was collaboration by church and state in seeking the conversion of the indigenous population to Christianity.Today, the Catholic Church is second only to government itself as a provider of government-funded social services, through organisations such as Catholic Social Services Australia and the St Vincent De Paul Society.The Anglican Church's Anglicare network is similarly engaged in areas such as emergency relief, aged care, family support service and help for the homeless.Other denominations assist through networks like UnitingCare Australia and the Salvation Army, and around a quarter of students attend church owned schools..Historically significant Australian Christians[1] have included the Reverend John Dunmore Lang, Saint

Australian Christians include Tim Costello; Baptist minister and current CEO of World Vision Australia; Frank Brennan, Jesuit human rights lawyer; John Dickson, historian and founder of The Centre for Public Christianity; Phillip Aspinall the current Archbishop of Brisbane, Philip Freier the current Anglican Primate of Australia and Archbishop of Melbourne; and recent Prime Ministers John Howard, Kevin Rudd, Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison..Like much of the Western world, Australia has been affected by the widespread decline in religiosity that has lowered the number of professing Christians

surface precipitation and the water table several meters beneath.Big sagebrush that is over a meter tall is an indicator of arable land, because it prefers deep, basic soils.[7] Sagebrush is generally long-lived once it makes it past the seedling stage, and can reach ages of over 100 years.[8].The species has a strong pungent fragrance (especially when wet) due to the presence of camphor, terpenoids and other volatile oils.[9] The taste is bitter and, together with the odor, serves to discourage browsing by many herbivores.\nQ: how does sagebrush effect community idaho\nReasoning:

two downtowns of San Diego and Tijuana in the South Bay, the city is at the center of one of the richest culturally diverse zones in the United States.Chula Vista is so named because of its scenic location between the San Diego Bay and coastal mountain foothills..The area, along with San Diego, was inhabited by the Kumeyaay before contact from the Spanish, who later claimed the area.In 1821, Chula Vista became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire, which reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later.California became part of the United States in 1848 as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850..Founded in the early 19th century and incorporated in October 1911, fast population growth has recently been observed in the

Amphitheatre, the Chula Vista marina, and the Living Coast Discovery Center.[14].Fossils of aquatic life, in the form of a belemnitida from the Jurassic, have been found within the modern borders of Chula Vista.[15] It is not until the Oligocene epoch that land life fossils have been found;[15][16] although Eocene epoch fossils have been found in nearby Bonita.[15] It is not until 10,000 years ago that human activity has been found within the modern borders of Chula Vista, primarily in Otay Valley of the San Dieguito people.[15] The oldest site of human settlement within the modern boundaries of Chula Vista, was named Otai by the Spanish in 1769, and had been occupied as far back as 7,980 years ago.[17] Another place where humans first settled within the modern boundaries of Chula Vista was at the Rolling Hills Site, which dates back to 7,000 years ago.[17].In 3000 BCE, people speaking the Yuman (Quechan) language began moving into the region from the Lower Colorado River Valley and southwestern Arizona portions of the Sonoran desert.Later the Kumeyaay tribe came to populate the land, on which the city sits today, and lived in the area for hundreds of years.[18] The

Ontario,[2] and throughout Canada for the description of electoral districts.By custom, it was applied in the original Thirteen Colonies that became the United States and in many other land jurisdictions based on English common law, including Zimbabwe, South Africa, India and Bangladesh.[3] While still in hand-me-down use, this system has been largely overtaken in the past few centuries by newer systems such as rectangular (government survey) and lot and block (recorded plat)..Typically the system uses physical features of the local geography, along with directions and distances, to define and describe the boundaries of a parcel of land.The boundaries are described in a running prose style, working around the parcel in sequence, from a point of beginning, returning to the same point; compare with the oral ritual of beating the bounds.It may include references to other adjoining parcels (and their owners), and it, in turn, could also be referred to in later surveys.At the time the description is compiled, it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monuments..A typical description for a small parcel of land would be: \"Commencing at a corner at the intersection of two stone walls near an apple tree on the north side of Muddy Creek road one mile above the junction of Muddy and Indian Creeks, thence north for 150 rods to the end of the stone wall bordering the road, thence northwest along a line to a large standing rock on the corner of the property now or formerly belonging to John Smith, thence west 150 rods to the corner of a barn near a large oak tree, thence south to Muddy Creek road, thence down the side of the creek road to the point of commencement.\" The sequence begins with an identified corner serving as benchmark.The description then gives distance, direction and various boundary descriptions as if one were walking the bounds pacing off the distance to the next corner where there is a change of direction.Where watercourses form part of the bounds their meander is generally taken as a straight line between the established corners and their monuments..In many deeds, the direction is described not by azimuth (a clockwise degree measure out of 360 degrees) but instead by bearing (a direction north or south followed by a degree measure out of 90 degrees and another direction west or east).For example, such a bearing might be listed as \"N 42\u00b035' W\", which means that the bearing is 42\u00b035' counterclockwise, or west of north.\nQ: what does metes and bounds

of universal gravitation is usually stated as that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.[note 1] The publication of the law has become known as the \"first great unification\", as it marked the unification of the previously described phenomena of gravity on Earth with known astronomical behaviors.[1][2][3].This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called inductive reasoning.[4] It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton's work Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (\"the Principia\"), first published on 5 July 1687.When Newton presented Book 1 of the unpublished text in April 1686 to the Royal Society, Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him..The equation for universal gravitation thus takes the form:.where F is the gravitational force acting between two objects, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, r is the distance between the centers of their masses, and G is the gravitational constant..The first test of Newton's law of gravitation between masses in the laboratory was the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798.[5] It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton's Principia and approximately 71 years after his death..Newton's law of gravitation resembles Coulomb's law of electrical forces, which is used to calculate the magnitude of the electrical force arising between two charged bodies.Both are inverse-square laws, where force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies.Coulomb's law has charge in place of mass and a different constant..Newton's law has later been superseded by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, but the universality of the gravitational constant is intact and the law still continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity in most applications.Relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme accuracy, or when dealing with very strong gravitational fields, such as those found near extremely massive and dense objects, or at small distances (such as Mercury's orbit around the

all forms of life.Every cell consists of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, and contains many macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA, as well as many small molecules of nutrients and metabolites.[1] The term comes from the Latin word cellula meaning 'small room'.[2].Cells can acquire specified function and carry out various tasks within the cell such as replication, DNA repair, protein synthesis, and motility.Cells are capable of specialization and mobility within the cell..Most plant and animal cells are only visible under a light microscope, with dimensions between 1 and 100micrometres.[3] Electron microscopy gives a much higher resolution showing greatly detailed cell structure.Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell such as bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals).[4] Most unicellular organisms are classed as microorganisms..The study of cells and how they work has led to many other studies in related areas of biology, including: discovery of DNA, cancer systems biology, aging and developmental biology..Cell biology is the study of cells, which were discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, who named them for their resemblance to cells inhabited by Christian monks in a monastery.[5][6] Cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells.[7] Cells emerged on Earth about 4 billion years ago.[8][9][10][11].With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology became advanced enough to discover cells.This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, known as cell biology.When observing a piece of cork under the scope, he was able to see pores.This was shocking at the time as it was believed

ahead.Headlamps are also often called headlights, but in the most precise usage, headlamp is the term for the device itself and headlight is the term for the beam of light produced and distributed by the device..Headlamp performance has steadily improved throughout the automobile age, spurred by the great disparity between daytime and nighttime traffic fatalities: the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states that nearly half of all traffic-related fatalities occur in the dark, despite only 25% of traffic travelling during darkness.[1].Other vehicles, such as trains and aircraft, are required to have headlamps.Bicycle headlamps are often used on bicycles, and are required in some jurisdictions.They can be powered by a battery or a small generator like a bottle or hub dynamo..The first horseless carriages used carriage lamps, which proved unsuitable for travel at speed.[2] The earliest lights used candles as the most common type of fuel.[3].The earliest headlamps, fuelled by combustible gas such as acetylene gas or oil, operated from the late 1880s.Acetylene gas lamps were popular in 1900s because the flame is resistant to wind and rain.Thick concave mirrors combined with magnifying lenses projected the acetylene flame light.[4] A number of car manufacturers offered Prest-O-Lite calcium carbide acetylene gas generator cylinder with gas feed pipes for lights as standard equipment for 1904 cars..The first electric headlamps were introduced in 1898 on the Columbia Electric Car from the Electric Vehicle Company of Hartford, Connecticut, and were optional.Two factors limited the widespread use of electric headlamps: the short life of filaments in the harsh automotive environment, and the difficulty of producing dynamos small enough, yet powerful enough to produce sufficient current.[5].\nQ: what are projection headlights\nReasoning: A motor scooter 's front with an impractical number and variety of headlamps, added for decorative

major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and is considered to be the top ranked professional ice hockey league in the world,[6] with players from 17 countries as of the 2023\u201324season[update].[7] The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) also views the Stanley Cup as one of the \"most important championships available to the sport\".[8].The National Hockey League was organized at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal on November 26, 1917, after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization, the National Hockey Association (NHA), which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew, Ontario.[9] The NHL immediately took the NHA's place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926..At its inception, the NHL had four teams, all in Canada, thus the adjective \"National\" in the league's name.The league expanded to the United States in 1924, when the Boston Bruins joined, and has since consisted of both American and Canadian teams.From 1942 to 1967, the league had only six teams, collectively (if not contemporaneously) nicknamed the \"Original Six\".The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the 1967 NHL expansion.The league then increased to 18 teams by 1974 and

as houseflies, cheese flies, and blowflies,[1] rather than larvae of the Nematocera, such as mosquitoes and crane flies..\"Maggot\" is not a technical term and should not be taken as such; in many standard textbooks of entomology, it does not appear in the index at all.[2][3] In many non-technical texts, the term is used for insect larvae in general.Other sources have coined their own definitions; for example: \"The term applies to a grub when all trace of limbs has disappeared\"[4] and \"Applied to the footless larvae of Diptera\".[5] Additionally, in Flies: The Natural History and Diversity of Diptera, the author claims maggots \"are larvae of higher Brachycera (Cyclorrhapha).\"[6].Maggot-like fly larvae are of significance in ecology and medicine; among other roles, various species are prominent in recycling carrion and garbage, attacking crops and foodstuffs, spreading microbial infections, and causing myiasis.Maggots are also particularly important in forensic entomology because their development can help determine the time of death, particularly maggots in the Calliphoridae family.[7].Anglers use maggots usually commercially supplied to catch non-predatory fish..Maggots are the most popular bait for anglers in Europe.[8] Anglers throw handfuls into the \"swim\" they are targeting, attracting the fish to the area.The anglers then use the largest or most attractive maggots on the hook, hoping to be irresistible to the fish.Commercial maggot breeders from the UK sell their maggots to tackle dealers throughout the E.U.and North America..In North America, maggots have been used primarily as ice fishing bait; recently, however, anglers have started using them year-round.[citation needed] Artificial maggots for fishing, either in natural or

Great (c.\u200972 BCE\u2013 c.\u20094 BCE) was a Roman Jewish client king of the Herodian Kingdom of Judea.[4][5][6] He is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea.Among these works are the rebuilding of the Second Temple in Jerusalem and the expansion of its base[7][8][9]\u2014the Western Wall being part of it.Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE Roman\u2013Jewish historian Josephus.[10].Herod also appears in the Christian Gospel of Matthew as the ruler of Judea who orders the Massacre of the Innocents at the time of the birth of Jesus, although most Herod biographers do not believe that this event occurred.[11] Despite his successes, including single-handedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing,[12] he has still been criticized by various historians.His reign polarizes opinion among historians, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, and some viewing it as a reminder of his tyrannical rule.[10].Upon Herod's death, the Romans divided his kingdom among three of his sons and his sister: Herod Archelaus became ethnarch of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea; Herod Antipas became tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea; Philip became tetrarch of territories north and east of the Jordan River; and Salome I was given a toparchy including the cities of Jabneh, Ashdod, and Phasaelis..Herod was born around 72 BCE[13][14] in Idumea, south of Judea.He was the second son of Antipater the Idumaean, a high-ranking official under ethnarch Hyrcanus II, and Cypros, a Nabatean Arab princess from Petra, in present-day Jordan.Herod's father was by descent an Edomite with a Jewish mother; his ancestors had converted to Judaism.Herod was raised as a Jew.[15][16][17][18][19] Strabo, a contemporary of Herod, held that the Idumaeans, whom he identified as of Nabataean origin, constituted the majority of the population of western Judea, where they commingled with the Judaeans and adopted their customs.[20] This is a view shared also by some modern scholarly works which consider Idumaeans as of Arab or Nabataean origins.[21][22][23][24] Thus Herod's ethnic background was Arab on both sides of his family.[15] According to Josephus, Herod was a descendant of Eleazar Maccabeus (Auran) of the Hasmoneans.[25].Herod rose to power largely through his father's good relations with the Roman general and dictator Julius Caesar, who entrusted  Antipater with the public affairs of Judea.[26] Herod was appointed provincial governor of Galilee in c.\u200947 BCE, when he was about either 25 or 28 years old (Greek original: \"15 years of age\").[27] There he faithfully farmed the taxes of that region for the Roman Senate, and he met with success in ridding that region of bandits.[28][29] Antipater's elder son, Phasael, served in the same capacity as governor of Jerusalem.During this time the young Herod cultivated a good relationship with Sextus Caesar, the acting Roman governor of Syria, who appointed Herod as general of Coelesyria and Samaria, greatly expanding his realm of influence.[30] He enjoyed the backing of Rome, but the Sanhedrin condemned his brutality.[3] When yet a private man, Herod had determined to punish Hyrcanus the Hasmonean king, who had once summoned Herod to stand trial for murder, but Herod was restrained from doing so by the intervention of his father and his elder brother..\nQ: how did king herod die\nReasoning: Herod (, Hordos, Greek : , H\u0113r\u014dd\u0113s), also known as Herod the Great (73/74 BCE \u2013 4 BCE in Jericho ), was a Roman client king

sera from different persons, and that some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood.[7] He wrote a two-sentence footnote:.The serum of healthy human beings not only agglutinates animal red

damage of bacterial kind.[8].This was the first evidence that blood variations exist in humans \u2013 it was believed that all humans have similar blood.The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals.Based on this he classified human blood into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C.He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type.Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A.\nQ: what antigen in present in type o+ and o-

table has two different and contradictory meanings:", "label": 0, "input": "Context: In parliamentary procedure, the verb to table has the opposite meaning in the United States from that of the rest of the world:.Motions which use the word \"table\" have specific meanings and functions, depending on the parliamentary authority used.The meaning of \"table\" also depends on the context in which it is used..Both the American and the British dialects have the expression \"to table a topic\" as a short way of saying \"to lay a topic on the table\" and \"to make a topic lie on the table\", but these have opposite meanings in the different varieties of the languages.The British meaning is based on the idea of parliamentarians gathering around a table with the bill laid upon so that all may point to sections for discussion.The American sense draws on the image of taking a paper that one has been examining and laying it aside, ending any discussion about it.The phrase \"put on the table\" can have the same meaning of \"making the issue available for debate\" in both dialects.[1][2][3] According to the American Heritage Dictionary, on the table in American English always has the two opposite meanings up for discussion and put aside for consideration at a later date depending on the context.[4].The British meaning of to \"table\" is to begin consideration of a proposal.[1] This comes from the use of the term to describe physically laying legislation on the table in the British Parliament; once an item on the order paper has been laid on the table, it becomes the current subject for debate.[5].The American meaning of \"to table\" is to postpone or suspend consideration of a motion.[1] In American usage, to allow consideration of the topic again, it would have to be \"taken from the table\".The use of expressions such as \"tabling a motion\" for setting aside or killing a main motion can cause confusion due to the usage of such expressions in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, where they have the opposite meaning\u2014that is, to propose a motion for consideration.[6][7] To make the intent clear internationally, the Congressional Quarterly and its associated CQ publications usually follow the word \"table\" (as used in Congress) with the word \"kill\" in parentheses in reporting congressional votes.[8][9].Under Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, the subsidiary motion to lay on the table is properly used only when it is necessary to suspend consideration of a main motion in order to deal with another matter that has come up unexpectedly and which must be dealt with before the pending motion can be properly addressed.[10] It has, however, become common to misuse this motion to end consideration of the pending main motion without debate, or to mistakenly assume that its adoption prevents further consideration of the main motion at all, or until a specified time.[11][12] Using \"table\" as a verb usually indicates misuse of this motion.[13] The book states, \"It is preferable to avoid moving 'to table' a motion, or 'that the motion be tabled.'\"[13].A main motion that has been laid on the table may be taken up again by adoption of a motion to take from the table.[14] A motion can be taken from the table at the same session (or meeting) or at the next session (or meeting) if that session occurs within a quarterly time interval.[15] Otherwise, the motion dies.[15].\nQ: what does a vote to table a motion mean?\nReasoning: In parliamentary procedure , a motion to table has two different and

watched, a stone \"not cut by human hands\" destroyed the statue and became a mountain filling the whole world.Daniel explained to the king that the statue represented four successive kingdoms beginning with Babylon, while the stone and mountain signified a kingdom established by God which would never be destroyed nor given to another people.Nebuchadnezzar then acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel's God and raises him to high office in Babylon.[1].The book of which Daniel is the hero divides into two parts, a set of tales in chapters 1\u20136, and the series of visions in chapters 7\u201312,[2] the tales no earlier than the Hellenistic period (323\u201330 BCE), and the visions from the Maccabean era (the mid-2nd century BCE).[3] Chapter 2 in its present form dates from no

BCE).[4].The overall theme of the Book of Daniel is God's sovereignty over history.[5] On the human level Daniel is set against the Babylonian magicians who fail to interpret the king's dream, but the cosmic conflict is between the God of Israel and the false Babylonian gods.[6] What counts is not Daniel's human gifts, nor his education in the arts of divination, but \"Divine Wisdom\" and the power that belongs to God alone, as Daniel indicates when he urges his companions to seek God's mercy for the interpretation of the king's dreams.[7].In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, is troubled by a dream.He summons his magicians and astrologers to interpret it, but demands that they first tell him what the dream was.They protest that no man can do such a thing, and Nebuchadnezzar orders that they all be executed.This decree also falls on Daniel, but he, through the agency of his God, is able to tell the king the dream.It was a dream of a great statue with a head

aircraft.Motive power is generated by converting the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy, either by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to power electric motors or, less commonly, by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine.[4].As of 2021[update], there are two models of hydrogen cars publicly available in select markets: the Toyota Mirai (2014\u2013), which is the world's first commercially produced dedicated fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV),[1][2][5] and the Hyundai Nexo (2018\u2013).There are also fuel cell buses.Hydrogen aircraft are not expected to carry many passengers long haul before the 2030s at the earliest.[6][7].As of 2019, 98% of hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming, which emits carbon dioxide.[8] It can be produced by electrolysis of water, or by thermochemical or pyrolytic means using renewable feedstocks, but the processes are currently expensive.[9] Various technologies are being developed that aim to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with hydrogen production using natural gas.[10].Vehicles running on hydrogen technology benefit from a long range on a single refuelling, but are subject to several drawbacks: high carbon emissions when hydrogen is produced from natural gas, capital cost burden, high energy inputs in production, low energy content per unit volume at ambient conditions, production and compression of hydrogen, the investment required to build refuelling infrastructure around the world to dispense hydrogen, and transportation of hydrogen.[11][12][13] In addition, leaked hydrogen has a global warming effect 11.6 times stronger than CO\u2082.[14].For light duty vehicles including passenger cars, hydrogen adoption is behind that of battery electric vehicles.A2022 study found that technological developments and economies of scale in BEVs, compared with the evolution of the use of hydrogen, have made it unlikely for hydrogen light-duty vehicles to play a significant role in the future.[15].The rationale for hydrogen vehicles lies in their potential to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, associated greenhouse gas emissions and localised air pollution from transportation.[18] This would require hydrogen to be produced cleanly, for use in sectors and applications where cheaper and more energy efficient mitigation alternatives are limited..Companies such as Boeing, Lange Aviation, and the German Aerospace Center pursue hydrogen as fuel for crewed and uncrewed aeroplanes.\nQ: How Hydrogen Fuel For Cars Work\nReasoning: Honda FCX

actual amount of positive (nuclear) charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom.The term \"effective\" is used because the shielding effect of negatively charged electrons prevent higher energy electrons from experiencing the full nuclear charge of the nucleus due to the repelling effect of inner layer.The effective nuclear charge experienced by an electron is also called the core charge.It is possible to determine the strength of the nuclear charge by the oxidation number of the atom.Most of the physical and chemical properties of the elements can be explained on the basis of electronic configuration.Consider the behavior of ionization energies in the periodic table.It is known that the magnitude of ionization potential depends upon the following factors:.In the periodic table, effective nuclear charge decreases down a group and increases left to right across a period..The effective atomic number Zeff, (sometimes referred to as the effective nuclear charge) of an atom is the number of protons that an electron in the element effectively 'sees' due to screening by inner-shell electrons.It is a measure of the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons in the atom.One can view the electrons in an atom as being 'stacked' by energy outside the nucleus; the lowest energy electrons (such as the 1s and 2s electrons) occupy the space closest to the nucleus, and electrons of higher energy are located further from the nucleus..The binding energy of an electron, or the energy needed to remove the electron

action figures, and other merchandise.[1] The show adapted stock footage from the Japanese TV series Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger (1992\u20131993), which was the 16th installment of Toei's Super Sentai franchise.[2] The second and third seasons of the show drew elements and stock footage from Gosei Sentai Dairanger and Ninja Sentai Kakuranger, respectively, though the Zyuranger costumes were still used for the lead cast in these two seasons.Only the mecha and the Kiba Ranger (White Ranger) costume from Dairanger were featured in the second season while only the Kakuranger mecha was featured in the third season, though the Kakuranger costumes were later used for the mini-series Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers.The series was produced by MMPR Productions and distributed by Saban Entertainment, while the show's merchandise was produced and distributed by Bandai Entertainment..While a global storyline would continue in Power Rangers Zeo, Power Rangers Turbo, Power Rangers in Space, and Power Rangers Lost Galaxy (which could be considered respectively and unofficially as the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons of the original series), the subsequent series would not be sequels or spin-offs in the traditional sense, having self-contained plots with no strong connection with the original series (except taking place in the same universe, not being reboots).The exceptions would be Power Rangers Dino Thunder, which could be considered as a continuation of the original classic series by having the presence of the character Tommy Oliver (the Green Ranger and later White Ranger, portrayed by Jason David Frank) as part of the regular team of Rangers of the generation of that series (in some of the other series the character only made special participations).Another series connected to the original classic series would be Power Rangers Operation Overdrive, as one of the main villains of this series, Thrax, is the son of Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, main villains of the classic series..In 2010, a remake of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, with a revised new look of the original 1993 logo, comic book-referenced graphics, and extra alternative visual effects, was broadcast on ABC Kids, and Bandai produced brand new toys to coincide with the series.Only the first 32 of season one's 60 episodes were remade.It was the final Power Rangers season to air on ABC Kids as Haim Saban re-acquired the franchise from Disney, who took over the rights in 2002.With the beginning of Power Rangers Samurai in 2011, the franchise had moved to

of mystery and the macabre.He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism and Gothic fiction in the United States, and of American literature.[1] Poe was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story, and is considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre, as well as a significant contributor to the emerging genre of science fiction.[2] He is the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.[3].Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Poe.[4] His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when his mother died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia.They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood.He attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money.He quarreled with John Allan over the funds for his education, and his gambling debts.In 1827, having enlisted in the United States Army under an assumed name, he published his first collection, Tamerlane and Other Poems, credited only to \"a Bostonian\".Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife in 1829.Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declared a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and parted ways with Allan..Poe switched his focus to prose, and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism.His work forced him to

meaning \"to devour\"), is an animal or plant whose food and energy requirements derive from animal tissues (mainly muscle, fat and other soft tissues) whether through hunting or scavenging.[1][2].The technical term for mammals in the order Carnivora is carnivoran, and they are so-named because most member species in the group have a carnivorous diet, but the similarity of the name of the order and the name of the diet causes confusion..Many but not all carnivorans are meat eaters; a few, such as the large and small cats (felidae) are obligate carnivores (see below).Other classes of carnivore are highly variable.The Ursids, for example: While the Arctic polar bear eats meat almost exclusively (more than 90% of its diet is meat), almost all other bear species are omnivorous, and one species, the giant panda, is nearly exclusively herbivorous.[3].Dietary carnivory is not a distinguishing trait of the order: Many mammals with highly carnivorous diets are not members of the order Carnivora.Cetaceans, for example, all eat other animals, but are paradoxically members of the almost exclusively plant-eating hooved mammals..Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called hypercarnivores or obligate carnivores, while those that also consume non-animal food are called mesocarnivores, or facultative carnivores, or omnivores (there are no clear distinctions).[2] A carnivore at the top of the food chain (adults not preyed upon by other animals) is termed an apex predator, regardless of whether it is an obligate or facultative carnivore..Outside the animal kingdom, there are several genera containing carnivorous plants (predominantly insectivores) and several phyla containing carnivorous fungi (preying mostly on microscopic invertebrates, such as nematodes, amoebae, and springtails)..Carnivores are sometimes characterized by their type of prey.For example, animals that eat mainly insects and similar invertebrates are

recovery, investigation, examination, and analysis of material found in digital devices, often in relation to mobile devices and computer crime.[1][2] The term \"digital forensics\" was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data.[1] With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged..Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications.The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts.Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as murder, theft, and assault against the person.Civil cases, on the other hand, deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes), but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (ediscovery) may be involved..Forensics may also feature in the private sector, such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigations (a special probe into the nature and extent of an unauthorized network intrusion)..The technical aspect of an investigation is divided into several sub-branches related to the type of digital devices involved: computer forensics, network forensics, forensic data analysis, and mobile device forensics.[3] The typical forensic process encompasses the seizure, forensic imaging (acquisition), and analysis of digital media, followed with the production of a report of the collected evidence..As well as identifying direct evidence of a crime, digital forensics can be used to attribute evidence to specific suspects, confirm alibis or statements, determine intent, identify sources (for example, in copyright cases), or authenticate documents.[4] Investigations are much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis (where the usual aim is to provide answers to a series of simpler questions), often involving complex time-lines or hypotheses.[5].Prior to the 1970s, crimes involving computers were dealt with using existing laws.The first computer crimes were recognized in the 1978 Florida Computer Crimes Act,[6] which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion of data on a computer system.[7] Over the next few years, the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright, privacy/harassment (e.g., cyber bullying, happy slapping, cyber stalking, and online predators), and child pornography.[8][9] It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences.Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983.[7] This was followed by the US Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989, and the British Computer Misuse Act in 1990.[7][9].The growth in computer crime during the 1980s and 1990s caused law enforcement agencies to begin establishing specialized groups, usually at the national level, to handle the technical

shadow/highlight detail and color saturation can be retained, and by how much either will be compromised..A \"color model\" is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (e.g.triples in RGB or quadruples in CMYK); however, a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation.Adding a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space establishes within the reference color space a definite \"footprint\", known as a gamut, and for a given color model, this defines a color space.For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model.When defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human

one's back and secured with two straps that go over the shoulders, but it can have an external frame, internal frame, and there are bodypacks..Backpacks are commonly used by hikers and students, and are often preferred to handbags for carrying heavy loads or carrying any sort of equipment, because of the limited capacity to carry heavy weights for long periods of time in the hands..Large backpacks, used to carry loads over 10 kilograms (22lb), as well as smaller sports backpacks (e.g.running, cycling, hiking, and hydration), usually offload the largest part (up to about 90%) of their weight onto padded hip belts, leaving the shoulder straps mainly for stabilising the load.This improves the potential to carry heavy loads, as the hips are stronger than the shoulders, and also increases agility and balance, since the load rides nearer the wearer's own center of mass..The word backpack was coined in the United States in the 1910s.Moneybag and packsack were used prior, and now occur mainly as regionalisms..The word rucksack is a German loanword mainly used in the UK, US and in other Western military forces.In Middle High German ruck(e) means \"back\" (dorsum), which led to the Upper German word ruggsack.In modern German the word \"der Rucksack\" is commonly used.[1] The name rucksack is cognate with the Danish rygs\u00e6k, Norwegian ryggsekk, Dutch rugzak, Afrikaans

"input": "Context: In baseball statistics, slugging percentage (SLG) is a measure of the batting productivity of a hitter.It is calculated as total bases divided by at-bats, through the following formula, where AB is the number of at-bats for a given player, and 1B, 2B, 3B, and HR are the number of singles, doubles, triples, and home runs, respectively:.Unlike batting average, slugging percentage gives more weight to extra-base hits such as doubles and home runs, relative to singles.Plate appearances resulting in walks, hit-by-pitches, catcher's interference, and sacrifice bunts or flies are specifically excluded from this calculation, as such an appearance is not counted as an at-bat (these are not factored into batting average either)..The name is a misnomer, as the statistic is not a percentage but an average of how many bases a player achieves per at bat.It is a scale of measure whose computed value is a number from 0 to 4.This might not be readily apparent given that a Major League Baseball player's slugging percentage is almost always less than 1 (as a majority of at bats result in either 0 or 1 base).The statistic gives a double twice the value of a single, a triple three times the value, and a home run four times.[2] The slugging percentage would have to be divided by 4 to actually be a percentage (of bases achieved per at bat out of total bases possible).As a result, it is occasionally called slugging average, or simply slugging, instead.[3].A slugging percentage is always expressed as a decimal to three decimal places, and is generally spoken as if multiplied by 1000.For example, a slugging percentage of .589 would be spoken as \"five eighty nine,\" and one of 1.127 would be spoken as \"eleven twenty seven.\".A slugging percentage

goat's milk.Goats were among the first animals to be domesticated for producing food.[2] Goat cheese is made around the world with a variety of recipes, giving many different styles of cheeses, from fresh and soft to aged and hard.[3].Goats produce high-quality, nutrient-rich milk under even the most difficult environments, making them valuable to arid or mountainous areas where cattle and sheep cannot survive.[4] Goats were one of the earliest animals domesticated to suit human needs\u2014more specifically milk production\u2014going back to 8,000 BC, 10,000 years ago.[2] Goat cheese has been made for at least as far back as 5,000 BC;[5] the first documented proof of humans making cheese of any kind dates to 7,500 years ago in Poland..Goat milk has higher proportions of medium-chain fatty acids, such as caproic and caprylic, which contribute to the characteristic tart/\"goat\" flavor of the cheese.[6] They also make goat milk and cheeses more easily digestible.[7].Goat milk, and therefore goat cheeses, contain anti-inflammatory enzymes, probiotics, antioxidants, proteins, and lipids and help maintain a healthy metabolism.These fatty acids take their name from the Latin for 'goat', capra.[8] It is also high in calcium, vitamins A and K, phosphorus, thiamin, and niacin.[4] Overall, the consumption of 60 grams (2.1oz) per day of cheese (both control and enriched), within the context of a balanced hypocaloric diet and recommendations for physical activity, was effective for the reduction of body weight, body mass index and waist circumference.[9].Goat cheese is made like other cheeses.The milk is filtered to remove unwanted impurities or deposits.A curdling starter agent is added, which can be rennet, or one or more starter bacteria that affect the curds' size and eventually the cheese's consistency.Some examples of starters are Lactococcus lactis lactis, L.l.cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus.\nQ: what cheese is made from goat's milk\nReasoning: Goat

as well as two species of genets.It varies in loudness and tone among species and in the same animal..Although true purring is exclusive to felids and viverrids,[1] other animals such as raccoons produce vocalizations that sound similar to true purring.Animals that produce purr-like sounds include mongooses, kangaroos, wallabies, wallaroos, badgers, rabbits and guinea pigs.[citation needed].Animals purr for a variety of reasons, including to express happiness or fear, and as a defense mechanism.It has also been shown that cats purr to manage pain and soothe themselves.[2] Purring is a soft buzzing sound, similar to a rolled 'r' with a fundamental frequency of around 25Hz.[3]  This sound occurs with noticeable vibrations on the surface of the body, varies in a rhythmic pattern during breathing and occurs continuously during inhalation and exhalation.The intensity and length of the purr can also vary depending on the level of arousal of the animal.[3].The mechanism by which cats purr is an object of speculation, with different hypotheses proposed.An early idea was that purring is a hemodynamic process where sound is produced as the blood runs through the thorax.[4].There is a unique \"neural oscillator\" in the cat's brain of uncertain significance.[5] Although the mechanism has not yet been fully explained, recent studies have inferred it could be the result of oscillatory mechanisms in the central nervous system.[6] Studies have also shown that purring can be caused through electrically stimulating the infundibular region of the cat's brain, suggesting central control.[7].One hypothesis, backed by electromyographic studies, is that cats produce the purring noise by using the vocal folds or the muscles of the larynx to alternately dilate and constrict the glottis rapidly, causing air vibrations during inhalation and exhalation.[8] Combined with the steady inhalation and exhalation of air as the cat breathes, a purring noise is produced with strong harmonics.[9].No cat can both purr and roar.\nQ: how does a cat purr\nReasoning: A purr is a sound made by all species of felids and is a part of cat communication ."}, {"question_id":

the causes of World War I remains a debated issue.World War I began in the Balkans on July 28, 1914, and hostilities ended on November 11, 1918, leaving 17 million dead and 25 million wounded.Moreover, the Russian Civil War can in many ways be considered a continuation of World War I, as can various other conflicts in the direct aftermath of 1918..Scholars looking at the long term seek to explain why two rival sets of powers (the German Empire and Austria-Hungary against the Russian Empire, France, the British Empire and later the United States) came into conflict by 1915.They look at such factors as political, territorial and economic competition; militarism, a complex web of alliances and alignments; imperialism, the growth of nationalism; and the power vacuum created by the decline of the Ottoman Empire.Other important long-term or structural factors that are often studied include unresolved territorial disputes, the perceived breakdown of the European balance of power,[1][2] convoluted and fragmented governance, arms races and security dilemmas,[3][4] a cult of the offensive,[1][5][4] and military planning.[6].Scholars seeking short-term analysis focus on the summer of 1914 and ask whether the conflict could have been stopped, or instead whether deeper causes made it inevitable.Among the immediate causes were the decisions made by statesmen and generals during the July Crisis, which was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by the Bosnian Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip, who had been supported by a nationalist organization in Serbia.[7] The crisis escalated as the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia was joined by their allies Russia, Germany, France, and ultimately Belgium and the United Kingdom.Other factors that came into play during the diplomatic crisis leading up to the war included misperceptions of intent (such as the German belief that Britain would remain neutral), the fatalistic belief that war was inevitable, and the speed with which the crisis escalated, partly due to delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications..The crisis followed a series of diplomatic clashes among the Great Powers (Italy, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary and Russia) over European and colonial issues in the decades before 1914 that had left tensions high.And the cause of the public clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe that had been taking place since 1867.[8].Consensus on the origins of the war remains elusive, since historians disagree on key factors and place differing emphasis on a variety of factors.\nQ: what caused ww\nReasoning: Personifications of Germany, France, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and the United

its colours and symbols, which may also be used separately from the flag as a symbol of the nation.The design of a national flag is sometimes altered after the occurrence of important historical events.The burning or destruction of a national flag is a greatly symbolic act..Historically, flags originated as military standards, used as field signs.Throughout history, various examples of such proto-flags exist: the white cloth banners of the Zhou dynasty's armies in the 11th century BC, the vexillum standards flown by the armies of the Roman Empire, the Black Standard famously carried by Muhammad which later became the flag of the Abbasid Caliphate, and the various \"Raven banners\" flown by Viking chieftains.Angelino Dulcert published a series of comprehensive Portolan charts in the 14th century AD, which famously showcased the flags of several polities depicted \u2013 although these are not uniformly \"national flags\", as some were likely the personal standards of the

17th century as the red-white-blue Statenvlag (\"States Flag\"), the naval flag of the States-General of the Dutch Republic, making the Dutch flag perhaps the oldest tricolour flag in continuous use, although standardisation of the exact colours is of a much later date.[1][2].During the age of sail in the early 17th century, the Union Jack finds its origins, when James VI of Scotland inherited the

cystine knot growth factor (NDP) gene, which is located on the X chromosome.[1][2] In addition to the congenital ocular symptoms, the majority of patients experience a progressive hearing loss starting mostly in their 2nd decade of life, and some may have learning difficulties among other additional characteristics..Patients with Norrie disease may develop cataracts, leukocoria (where the pupils appear white when light is shone on them), along with other developmental issues in the eye, such as shrinking of the globe and the wasting away of the iris.[2] Around 30 to 50% of them will also have developmental delay or learning difficulties, psychotic-like features, incoordination of movements or behavioral abnormalities.[2] Most patients are born with normal hearing; however, the onset of hearing loss is very common in early adolescence.[3] About 15% of patients are estimated to develop all the features of the disease.[4].Due to the X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance, Norrie disease affects almost entirely males.Only in very rare cases, females have been diagnosed with Norrie disease; cases of symptomatic female carriers have been reported.[5][6] It is a very rare disorder that is not associated with any specific ethnic or racial groups, with cases reported worldwide (including cases in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australasia).[7][8][9][10] While more than 400 cases have been described, the prevalence and incidence of the disease still remains unknown.[11][12].The most prominent symptoms initially observed in Norrie disease are ocular.Initial characteristics are usually identified at birth or in early infancy, with parents often noticing abnormal eye features or that their child fails to show a response to light.[13][14][15] The first visible finding is leukocoria, a grayish-yellow pupillary reflection that originates from a mass of disorganized tissue behind the lens.This material, which possibly includes an already detached retina, may be confused with a tumor and thus is termed pseudoglioma.[2][11] However, an affected baby may have a normally sized eye globe and unremarkable iris, anterior chamber, cornea and intraocular pressure.Over the first few months of life, complete or partial retinal detachment evolves.From infancy through childhood, the patient may undergo progressive changes in the disease.[2] Disease progression often includes vitreoretinal hemorrhages, the formation of cataracts, deterioration of the iris with adhesions forming between the iris and the lens or the cornea, and shallowing of the anterior chamber which may increase intraocular pressure, causing eye pain.[2] As the situation worsens, there is corneal opacification, where the cornea becomes opaque, and band keratopathy.Intraocular pressure is lost and the globe shrinks.In the last stage of Norrie disease, the globes appear small and sunken in (phthisis bulbi) and the cornea appears to be milky.[2].\nQ:

and obligations pertaining to two or more mutually agreeing parties.A contract typically involves the transfer of goods, services, money, or a promise to transfer any of those at a future date, and the activities and intentions of the parties entering into a contract may be referred to as contracting.In the event of a breach of contract, the injured party may seek judicial remedies such as damages or rescission.[1] A binding agreement between actors in international law is known as a treaty..Contract law, the field of the law of obligations concerned with contracts, is based on the principle that agreements must be honoured.[2] Like other areas of private law, contract law varies between jurisdictions.In general, contract law is exercised and governed either under common law jurisdictions, civil law jurisdictions, or mixed-law jurisdictions that combine elements of both common and civil law.Common law jurisdictions typically require contracts to include consideration in order to be valid, whereas civil and most mixed-law jurisdictions solely require a meeting of the minds between the parties..Within the overarching category of civil law jurisdictions, there are several distinct varieties of contract law with their own distinct criteria: the German tradition is characterised by the unique doctrine of abstraction, systems based on the Napoleonic Code are characterised by their systematic distinction between different types of contracts, and Roman-Dutch law is largely based on the writings of renaissance-era Dutch jurists and case law applying general principles of Roman law prior to the Netherlands' adoption of the Napoleonic Code.The UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, published in 2016, aim to provide a general harmonised framework for international contracts, independent of the divergences between national laws, as well as a statement of common contractual principles for arbitrators and judges to apply where national laws are lacking.Notably, the Principles reject the doctrine of consideration, arguing that elimination of the doctrine \"bring[s] about greater certainty and reduce litigation\" in international trade.[3] The Principles also rejected the abstraction principle on the grounds that it and similar doctrines are \"not easily compatible with modern business perceptions and practice\".[3].Contract law can be contrasted with tort law (also referred to in some jurisdictions as the law of delicts), the other major area of the law of obligations.While tort law generally deals with private duties and obligations that exist by operation of law, and provide remedies for civil wrongs committed between individuals not in a pre-existing legal relationship, contract law provides for the creation and enforcement of duties and obligations through a prior agreement between parties.The emergence of quasi-contracts, quasi-torts, and quasi-delicts renders the boundary between tort and contract law somewhat uncertain.[4].\nQ: what kind of legal remedy is it to ask someone to fulfill there promise\nReasoning: A contract is an agreement having a lawful object entered into voluntarily by two or

1315\u20131317 and the end of the Black Death in 1350, when it was nearly 370,000,000.[4] The highest global population growth rates, with increases of over 1.8% per year, occurred between 1955 and

increasing, but there is significant uncertainty about its long-term trajectory due to changing fertility and mortality rates.[7] The UN Department of Economics and Social Affairs projects between 9

this number); by the late 18th century, estimates ranged close to one billion (consistent with current estimates).[13] More refined estimates, broken down by continents, were published in the first

current population estimates are fraught with uncertainties from 3% to 5%.[15].Estimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15million.[16][17] Even earlier, genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BC, according to the now

"label": 0, "input": "Context: In psycholinguistics, language processing refers to the way humans use words to communicate ideas and feelings, and how such communications are processed and understood.Language processing is considered to be a uniquely human ability that is not produced with the same grammatical understanding or systematicity in even human's closest primate relatives.[1].Throughout the 20th century the dominant model[2] for language processing in the brain was the Geschwind-Lichteim-Wernicke model, which is based primarily on the analysis of brain-damaged patients.However, due to improvements in intra-cortical electrophysiological recordings of  monkey and human brains, as well non-invasive techniques such as fMRI, PET, MEG and EEG, a dual auditory pathway[3][4] has been revealed and a two-streams model has been developed.In accordance with this model, there are two pathways that connect the auditory cortex to the frontal lobe, each pathway accounting for different linguistic roles.The auditory ventral stream pathway is responsible for sound recognition, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'what' pathway.The auditory dorsal stream in both humans and non-human primates is responsible for sound localization, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'where' pathway.In humans, this pathway (especially in the left hemisphere) is also responsible for speech production, speech repetition, lip-reading, and phonological working memory and long-term memory.In accordance with the 'from where to what' model of language evolution,[5][6] the reason the ADS is characterized with such a broad range of functions is that each indicates a different stage in language evolution..The division of the two streams first occurs in the auditory nerve where the anterior branch enters the anterior cochlear nucleus in the brainstem which gives rise to the auditory ventral stream.The posterior branch enters the dorsal and posteroventral cochlear nucleus to give rise to the auditory dorsal stream.[7]:\u200a8.Language processing can also occur in relation to signed languages or written content..\nQ: how does the brain

Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks, and a genre of ancient Greek folklore, today absorbed alongside Roman mythology into the broader designation of classical mythology.These stories concern the ancient Greek religion's view of the origin and nature of the world; the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and mythological creatures; and the origins and significance of the ancient Greeks' cult and ritual practices.Modern scholars study the myths to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece, and to better understand the nature of myth-making itself.[1].The Greek myths were initially propagated in an oral-poetic tradition most likely by Minoan and Mycenaean singers starting in the 18th centuryBC;[2] eventually the myths of the heroes of the Trojan War and its aftermath became part of the oral tradition of Homer's epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey.Two poems by Homer's near contemporary Hesiod, the Theogony and the Works and Days, contain accounts of the genesis of the world, the succession of divine rulers, the succession of human ages, the origin of human woes, and the origin of sacrificial practices.Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns, in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle, in lyric poems, in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth centuryBC, in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age, and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias..Aside from this narrative deposit in ancient Greek literature, pictorial representations of gods, heroes, and mythic episodes featured prominently in ancient vase paintings and the decoration of votive gifts and many other artifacts.Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth centuryBC depict scenes from the Epic Cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles.In the succeeding Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.[3].Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture, arts, and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language.Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes.[4]:\u200a43.Greek mythology is known today primarily from Greek literature and representations on visual media dating from the Geometric period from c.\u2009900BC to c.\u2009800BC onward.[5]:\u200a200\u200a In fact, literary and archaeological sources integrate, sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict; however, in many cases, the existence of this corpus of data

is also the first part of the alimentary canal which leads to the pharynx and the gullet.In tetrapod vertebrates, the mouth is bounded on the outside by the lips and cheeks \u2014 thus the oral cavity is also known as the buccal cavity (from Latin bucca, meaning \"cheek\")[2] \u2014 and contains the tongue on the inside.Except for some groups like birds and lissamphibians, vertebrates usually have teeth in their mouths,[3] although some fish species have pharyngeal teeth instead of oral teeth..Most bilaterian phyla, including arthropods, molluscs and chordates, have a two-opening gut tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other.Which end forms first in ontogeny is a criterion used to classify bilaterian animals into protostomes and deuterostomes..In the first multicellular animals, there was probably no mouth or gut and food particles were engulfed by the cells on the exterior surface by a process known as endocytosis.The particles became enclosed in vacuoles into which enzymes were secreted and digestion took place intracellularly.The digestive products were absorbed into the cytoplasm and diffused into other cells.This form of digestion is used nowadays by simple organisms such as Amoeba and Paramecium and also by sponges which, despite their large size, have no mouth or gut and capture their food by endocytosis.[4].However, most animals have a mouth and a gut, the lining of which is continuous with the epithelial cells on the surface of the body.A few animals which live parasitically originally had guts but have secondarily lost these structures.\nQ: How do you

exploration was driven by a \"Space Race\" between the Soviet Union and the United States.A driving force of the start of space exploration was during the Cold War.After the ability to create nuclear weapons, the narrative of defense/offense left land and the power to control the air became the focus.Both the Soviet and the U.S.were fighting to prove their superiority in technology through exploring the unknown: space.In fact, the reason NASA was made was due to the response of Sputnik I.[3] The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period.The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971..After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS)..\nQ: how many missions has the us sent to mars\nReasoning:

Vermont, Coolidge was a Republican lawyer from New England who climbed the ladder of Massachusetts politics, becoming the state's 48th governor.His response to the Boston police strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight as a man of decisive action.The next year, Coolidge was elected the country's 29th vice president and succeeded the presidency upon the sudden death of President Warren G.Harding in 1923.Elected in his own right in 1924, Coolidge gained a reputation as a small-government conservative with a taciturn personality and dry sense of humor that earned him the nickname \"Silent Cal\".Though his widespread popularity enabled him to run for a second full term, Coolidge chose not to run again in 1928, remarking that ten years as president would be \"longer than any other man has had it\u2013 too long!\"[b].Throughout his gubernatorial career, Coolidge ran on the record of fiscal conservatism, strong support for women's suffrage, and a vague opposition to Prohibition.[2] During his presidency, he restored public confidence in the White House after the many scandals of the Harding administration.He signed into law the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, which granted U.S.citizenship to all Native Americans, and oversaw a period of rapid and expansive economic growth known as the \"Roaring Twenties\", leaving office with considerable popularity.[3] He was known for his hands-off governing approach and pro-business stances; as biographer Claude Fuess wrote: \"He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class, could interpret their longings and

origin.[1][2] The French also made a significant contribution to the invention of the first coffee makers, predecessors of today's espresso machines, and generally to the caf\u00e9 culture.Espresso can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under pressure through finely-ground coffee beans.Espresso is the most common way of making coffee in southern Europe, especially in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and Greece, but it is also popular in the rest of the world..Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, with a viscosity similar to that of warm honey.This is due to the higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and the crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).[3] As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated..Espresso contains more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, but as its usual serving size of 25\u201330 ml (1 US oz) is much smaller than other coffee drinks, the overall caffeine content of a single serving of espresso is generally lower than that of other coffees.[4] While the exact caffeine content of any coffee drink will vary, a typical 30 millilitres (1 US fluid ounce) serving of espresso contains approximately 65 milligrams of caffeine, but a typical 240 millilitres (8 US fluid ounces) serving of drip coffee contains between 150 and 200mg of caffeine.[5][6][7].The three dispersed phases in espresso are what make this beverage unique.The first dispersed phase is an emulsion of oil droplets.The second phase is suspended solids, while the third is the layer of gas bubbles or foam.The dispersion of very small oil droplets is perceived in the mouth as creamy.This characteristic of espresso contributes to what is known as the body of the beverage.These oil droplets preserve some of the aromatic compounds that are lost to the air in other coffee forms, enhancing the strong flavor of espresso.[8].\nQ: how much caffeine is in a shot of espresso\nReasoning: Espresso is a concentrated beverage brewed by forcing

"input": "Context: A contract is an agreement that specifies certain legally enforceable rights and obligations pertaining to two or more mutually agreeing parties.A contract typically involves the transfer of goods, services, money, or a promise to transfer any of those at a future date, and the activities and intentions of the parties entering into a contract may be referred to as contracting.In the event of a breach of contract, the injured party may seek judicial remedies such as damages or rescission.[1] A binding agreement between actors in international law is known as a treaty..Contract law, the field of the law of obligations concerned with contracts, is based on the principle that agreements must be honoured.[2] Like other areas of private law, contract law varies between jurisdictions.In general, contract law is exercised and governed either under common law jurisdictions, civil law jurisdictions, or mixed-law jurisdictions that combine elements of both common and civil law.Common law jurisdictions typically require contracts to include consideration in order to be valid, whereas civil and most mixed-law jurisdictions solely require a meeting of the minds between the parties..Within the overarching category of civil law jurisdictions, there are several distinct varieties of contract law with their own distinct criteria: the German tradition is characterised by the unique doctrine of abstraction, systems based on the Napoleonic Code are characterised by their systematic distinction between different types of contracts, and Roman-Dutch law is largely based on the writings of renaissance-era Dutch jurists and case law applying general principles of Roman law prior to the Netherlands' adoption of the Napoleonic Code.The UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, published in 2016, aim to provide a general harmonised framework for international contracts, independent of the divergences between national laws, as well as a statement of common contractual principles for arbitrators and judges to apply where national laws are lacking.Notably, the Principles reject the doctrine of consideration, arguing that elimination of the doctrine \"bring[s] about greater certainty and reduce litigation\" in international trade.[3] The Principles also rejected the abstraction principle on the grounds that it and similar doctrines are \"not easily compatible with modern business perceptions and practice\".[3].Contract law can be contrasted with tort law (also referred to in some jurisdictions as the law of delicts), the other major area of the law of obligations.While tort law generally deals with private duties and obligations that exist by operation of law, and provide remedies for civil wrongs committed between individuals not in a pre-existing legal relationship, contract law provides for the creation and enforcement of duties and obligations through a prior agreement between parties.The emergence of quasi-contracts, quasi-torts, and quasi-delicts renders the boundary between tort and contract law somewhat uncertain.[4].\nQ: how is a contract legally binding?\nReasoning: A contract is an agreement

"Context: Affluence refers to an individual's or household's economical and financial advantage in comparison to others.[1] It may be assessed through either income or wealth..In absolute terms affluence is a relatively widespread phenomenon in the United States, with over 30% of households having an income exceeding $100,000 per year and over 30% of households having a net worth exceeding $250,000, as of 2019.[2][3] However, when looked at in relative terms, wealth is highly concentrated: the bottom 50% of Americans only share 2% of total household wealth while the top 1% hold 35% of that wealth..In the United States, as of 2019, the median household income is $60,030 per year and the median household net worth is $97,300, while the mean household income is $89,930 per year and the mean household net worth is $692,100.[2][3].While income is often seen as a type of wealth in colloquial language use, wealth and income are two substantially different measures of economic prosperity.Wealth is the total value of net possessions of an individual or household, while income is the total inflow of monetary assets over a given time period.Hence the change in wealth over that time period is equal to the income minus the expenditures in that period.Income is a so-called \"flow\" variable, while wealth is a so-called \"stock\" variable..Affluence in the United States has been attributed in many cases to inherited wealth amounting to \"a substantial head start\":[6][7] in September 2012, the Institute for Policy Studies found that over 60 percent of the Forbes richest 400 Americans had grown up with substantial privilege.[8].Income is commonly used to measure affluence, although this is a relative indicator: a middle class person with a personal income of $77,500 annually and a billionaire may both be referred to as affluent, depending on reference groups.An average American with a median income of $32,000[9] ($39,000 for those employed full-time between the

executive of a Fortune 500 company, then the description would not apply.[11][12] Accordingly, marketing firms and investment houses classify those with household incomes exceeding $250,000 as mass affluent, while the threshold upper class is most commonly defined as the top 1% with household incomes commonly exceeding $525,000 annually..According to the U.S.Census Bureau, 42% of U.S.\nQ: how

selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR), also known as a rhizotomy, dorsal rhizotomy, or a selective posterior rhizotomy, is a neurosurgical procedure that selectively cut problematic nerve roots of the spinal cord.[3][note 1] This procedure has been well-established in the literature as a surgical intervention and is used to relieve negative symptoms of neuromuscular conditions such as spastic diplegia and other forms of spastic cerebral palsy.[4] The specific sensory nerves inducing spasticity are identified using electromyographic (EMG) stimulation and graded on a scale of 1 (mild) to 4 (severe spasticity).Abnormal nerve responses (usually graded a 3 or 4) are isolated and cut, thereby reducing symptoms of spasticity.[3].Spasticity is defined as a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone in response to a stretch.[5]  This upper motor neuron condition results from a lack of descending input from the brain that would normally release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), which serves to dampen neuronal excitability in the nervous system.[6]  Spasticity is thought to be caused by an excessive increase of excitatory signals from sensory nerves without proper inhibition by GABA.[7]  Two common conditions associated with this lack of descending input are cerebral palsy and acquired brain injury.[6].Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR), less often referred to as selective posterior rhizotomy (SPR), is the most widely used form of rhizotomy, and is today a primary treatment for spastic diplegia, best done in the youngest years before bone and joint deformities from the pull of spasticity take place.Still, it can be performed safely and effectively on adults as well..SDR is a permanent procedure that addresses the spasticity at its neuromuscular root: i.e., in the central nervous system that contains the misfiring nerves that cause the spasticity of those particular muscles in the first place.After SDR, the person's spasticity is usually eliminated, revealing the \"real\" strength (or lack thereof) of the muscles underneath.SDR's result is fundamentally unlike orthopedic surgical procedures, where spasticity is left untreated..Because there is always temporary weakness after SDR, patients should work hard to strengthen the weak muscles with physical therapy and learn habits of movement and daily tasks in a body without spasticity..SDR is usually performed on the pediatric spastic cerebral palsy population between the ages of 2 and 6.This is the age range where orthopedic deformities from spasticity have not yet occurred or are minimal.It is also variously claimed by clinicians that another advantage of doing the surgery so young is that it is inherently easier for these young children to restrengthen their muscles and to re-learn how to walk, often having the effect that later in life, they do not even remember the period when they lived with the spasticity at all.\nQ: How will I feel after my

of Hebrew scriptures, including the Torah, the Nevi'im, and the Ketuvim.Different branches of Judaism and Samaritanism have maintained different versions of the canon, including the 3rd-century BCE Septuagint text used in Second Temple Judaism, the Syriac Peshitta, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and most recently the 10th-century medieval Masoretic Text compiled by the Masoretes, currently used in Rabbinic Judaism.[2] The terms \"Hebrew Bible\" or \"Hebrew Canon\" are frequently confused with the Masoretic Text; however, this is a medieval version and one of several texts considered authoritative by different types of Judaism throughout history.[2] The current edition of the Masoretic Text is mostly in Biblical Hebrew, with a few passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel and Ezra, and the verse Jeremiah 10:11).[3].The authoritative form of the modern Hebrew Bible used in Rabbinic Judaism is the Masoretic Text (7th to 10th century CE), which consists of 24 books, divided into chapters and pesuqim (verses).The Hebrew Bible developed during the Second Temple Period, as the Jews decided which religious texts were of divine origin; the Masoretic Text, compiled by the Jewish scribes and scholars of the Early Middle Ages, comprises the Hebrew and Aramaic 24 books that they considered authoritative.[2].The Hellenized Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria produced a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible called \"the Septuagint\", that included books later identified as the Apocrypha, while the Samaritans produced their own edition of the Torah, the Samaritan Pentateuch; according to the Dutch\u2013Israeli biblical scholar and linguist Emanuel Tov, professor of Bible Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, both of these ancient editions of the Hebrew Bible differ significantly from the medieval Masoretic Text.[2].In addition to the Masoretic Text, modern biblical scholars seeking to understand the history of the Hebrew Bible use a range of sources.[4] These include the Septuagint, the Syriac language Peshitta translation, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls collection, and quotations from rabbinic manuscripts.These sources may be older than the Masoretic Text in some cases and often differ from it.[5] These differences have given rise to the theory that yet another text, an Urtext of the Hebrew Bible, once existed and is the source of the versions extant today.[6] However, such an Urtext has never been found, and which of the three commonly known versions (Septuagint, Masoretic Text, Samaritan Pentateuch) is closest to the Urtext is debated.[7].There are many similarities between the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament.The Protestant Old Testament has the same books as the Hebrew Bible, but the books are arranged in different orders.The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches include the Deuterocanonical books, which are not included in the Hebrew Bible.[8].Tanakh is an acronym, made from the first Hebrew letter of each of the Masoretic Text's three traditional divisions: Torah (literally 'Instruction' or 'Law'),[9] Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings)\u2014hence TaNaKh..The three-part division reflected in the acronym Tanakh is well attested in the rabbinic literature.[10] During that period, however, Tanakh was not used.\nQ:

1998 with the Launch of the G series.The G series saw no increase in displacement but power went from 100BHP to 108BHP thanks to the newly designed airbox.[citation needed] The fairing was revamped,

coil with HT lead..With strong competition from Honda's CBR600F4i, Suzuki's GSX-R600, and Yamaha's YZF-R6, Kawasaki decided on an unusual move for the late 2002 models.They increased the capacity of the traditional 600cc (37cuin) motor to 636 cubic centimetres (38.8cuin) with the ZX-6R A1P.This version used the J series bodywork with the only notable differences being the \"636\" stickers on the

temperature and pressure.However, the BTU is not standardised worldwide, with slightly different values in the EU, UK, and USA, meaning that the energy content of the therm also varies by territory..Natural gas meters measure volume and not energy content, and given that the energy density varies with the mix of hydrocarbons in the natural gas, a 'therm factor' is used by natural gas companies to convert the volume of gas used to its heat equivalent, usually being expressed in units of 'therms per CCF' (CCF is an abbreviation for 100 cubic feet).Higher than average concentration of ethane, propane or butane will increase the therm factor and the inclusion of non-flammable impurities, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen will reduce it.The Wobbe Index of a fuel gas is also sometimes used to quantify the amount of heat per unit volume burnt..A decatherm or dekatherm[5] (dth or Dth) is 10 therms, which is 1,000,000British thermal units or 1.055 GJ.[6][7] It is a combination of the prefix  for 10 (deca, often with the US spelling \"deka\") and the energy unit therm.There is some ambiguity, as \"decatherm\" uses the prefix \"d\" to mean 10, where in metric the prefix \"d\" means \"deci\" or one-tenth, and the prefix \"da\" means \"deca\", or 10, though decatherm may use a capital \"D\".The energy content of 1,000 cubic feet (28m3) natural gas measured at standard conditions is approximately equal to one dekatherm..This unit of energy is used primarily to measure natural gas.Natural gas is a mixture of gases containing approximately 80% methane (CH4) and its heating value varies from about or 10.1 to 11.4 kilowatt-hours per cubic metre (975 to 1,100Btu/cuft), depending on the mix of different gases in the gas stream.The volume of natural gas with

ones).[7] For example, some strains of E.coli benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2[8] or by preventing the colonization of the intestine by pathogenic bacteria.These mutually beneficial relationships between E.coli and humans are a type of mutualistic biological relationship \u2014 where both the humans and the E.coli are benefitting each other.[9][10] E.coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter.The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for three days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.[11].E.coli and other facultative anaerobes constitute about 0.1% of gut microbiota,[12] and fecal\u2013oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease.Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination.[13][14] A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E.coli which can survive for many days and grow outside a host.[15].\nQ: how does the e coli bacteria cause death\nReasoning: Escherichia coli (; commonly abbreviated E. coli) is a Gram-negative , rod-shaped bacterium that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms)."}, {"question_id": "Q450", "question": "what area

of ozone in Earth's atmosphere, and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone (the ozone layer) around Earth's polar regions.[1] The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole.There are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events in addition to these stratospheric events..The main causes of ozone depletion and the ozone hole are manufactured chemicals, especially manufactured halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCFCs, halons), referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS).[2] These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by turbulent mixing after being emitted from the surface, mixing much faster than the molecules can settle.[3] Once in the stratosphere, they release atoms from the halogen group through photodissociation, which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2).[4] Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halocarbons increased..Ozone depletion and the ozone hole have generated worldwide concern over increased cancer risks and other negative effects.The ozone layer prevents harmful wavelengths of ultraviolet (UVB) light from passing through the Earth's atmosphere.These wavelengths cause skin cancer, sunburn, permanent blindness, and cataracts,[5] which were projected to increase dramatically as a result of thinning ozone, as well as harming plants and animals.These concerns led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which bans the production of CFCs, halons, and other ozone-depleting chemicals.[6] Currently,[when?] scientists plan to develop new refrigerants to replace older ones.[7].The ban came into effect in 1989.Ozone levels stabilized by the mid-1990s and began to recover in the 2000s, as the shifting of the jet stream in the southern hemisphere towards the south pole has stopped and might even be reversing.[8] Recovery is projected to continue over the next century, and the ozone hole was expected to reach pre-1980 levels by around 2075.[9] In 2019, NASA reported that the ozone hole was the smallest ever since it was first discovered in 1982.[10][11].The Montreal Protocol is considered the most successful international environmental agreement to date.[12][13] Following the bans on ozone-depleting chemicals, the UN projects that under the current regulations the ozone layer will completely regenerate by 2045, thirty years earlier than previously predicted.[14].Three forms (or allotropes) of oxygen are involved in the ozone-oxygen cycle: oxygen atoms (O or atomic oxygen), oxygen gas (O2 or diatomic oxygen), and ozone gas (O3 or triatomic oxygen).[15] Ozone is formed in the stratosphere when oxygen gas molecules photodissociate after absorbing UVC photons.This converts a single O2 into two atomic oxygen radicals.\nQ: what causes destruction of the ozone layer\nReasoning: Image of the largest Antarctic ozone hole ever

Committee on Style, which wrote its final draft, with Gouverneur Morris leading the effort.It was not proposed or discussed on the floor of the convention beforehand.The initial wording of the preamble did not refer to the people of the United States; rather, it referred to people of the various states, which was the norm..In earlier documents, including the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, the Articles of Confederation, and the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognizing American independence, the word \"people\" was not used, and the phrase the United States was followed immediately by a listing of the states, from north to south.[1]  The change was made out of necessity, as the Constitution provided that, whenever the popularly elected ratifying conventions of nine states gave their approval, it would go into effect for those nine, irrespective of whether any of the remaining states ratified.[2].The Preamble serves solely as an introduction and does not assign powers to the federal government,[3] nor does it provide specific limitations on government action.Due to the Preamble's limited nature, no court has ever used it as a decisive factor in case adjudication,[4] except as regards frivolous litigation.[5].The courts have shown interest in any clues they can find in the Preamble regarding the Constitution's meaning.[6] Courts have developed several techniques for interpreting the meaning of statutes and these are also used to interpret the Constitution.[7] As a result, the courts have said that interpretive techniques that focus on the exact text of a document[8] should be used in interpreting the meaning of the Constitution.Balanced against these techniques are those that focus more attention on broader efforts to discern the meaning of the

immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses.The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called an antigen.[2][3] Each tip of the \"Y\" of an antibody contains a paratope (analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision.Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize it directly (for example, by blocking a part of a virus that is essential for its invasion)..To allow the immune system to recognize millions of different antigens, the antigen-binding sites at both tips of the antibody come in an equally wide variety..In contrast, the remainder of the antibody is relatively constant.In mammals, antibodies occur in a few variants, which define the antibody's class or isotype: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM..The constant region at the trunk of the antibody includes sites involved in interactions with other components of the immune system.The class hence determines the function triggered by an antibody after binding to an antigen, in addition to some structural features..Antibodies from different classes also differ in where they are released in the body and at what stage of an immune

insurance, and out-of-pocket payments.The U.S.is the only developed country without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of its population lacks health insurance.[1][2][3][4].The United States spends more on healthcare than any other country, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP.[1] However, this expenditure does not necessarily translate into better overall health outcomes compared to other developed nations.[5] Coverage varies widely across the population, with certain groups, such as the elderly and low-income individuals, receiving more comprehensive care through government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare..The U.S.healthcare system has been the subject of significant political debate and reform efforts, particularly in the areas of healthcare costs, insurance coverage, and the quality of care.Legislation such as the Affordable Care Act of 2010 has sought to address some of these issues, though challenges remain..Uninsured rates have fluctuated over time, and disparities in access to care exist based on factors such as income, race, and geographical location.[6][7][8][9] The private insurance model predominates, and employer-sponsored insurance is a common way for individuals to obtain coverage.[1][10][11] The complex nature of the system, as well as its high costs, has led to ongoing discussions about the future of healthcare in the United States..At the same time, the United States is a global leader in medical innovation, measured either in terms of revenue or the number of new drugs and devices introduced.[12][13] The Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity concluded that the United States dominates science & technology, which \"was on full display during the

by weight and by volume.Ensuring the right amount of body water is part of fluid balance, an aspect of homeostasis..By weight, the average adult human is approximately 60% water, and the average child is approximately 65% water.[1][2] There can be considerable variation in body water percentage based on a number of factors like age, health, water intake, weight, and sex.In a large study of adults

am loved\", \"I am worthy\") as well as emotional states, such as triumph, despair, pride, and shame.[1] Smith and Mackie define it by saying \"The self-concept is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it (see self).\"[2].The construct of self-esteem has been shown to be a desirable one in psychology, as it is associated with a variety of positive outcomes, such as academic achievement,[3][4] relationship satisfaction,[5] happiness,[6] and lower rates of criminal behavior.The benefits of high self-esteem are thought to include improved mental and physical health, and less anti-social behavior [7] while drawbacks of low self-esteem have been found to be anxiety, loneliness, and increased vulnerability to substance abuse.[8].Self-esteem can apply to a specific attribute or globally.Psychologists usually regard self-esteem as an enduring personality characteristic (trait self-esteem), though normal, short-term variations (state self-esteem) also exist.Synonyms or near-synonyms of self-esteem include: self-worth,[9] self-regard,[10] self-respect,[11][12] and self-integrity..The concept of self-esteem has its origins in the 18th century, first expressed in the writings of the Scottish enlightenment thinker David Hume.Hume posits that it is important to value and think well of oneself because it serves a motivational function that enables people to explore their full potential.[13][14].The identification of self-esteem as a distinct psychological construct has its origins in the work of philosopher and psychologist, William James.James identified multiple dimensions of the self, with two levels of hierarchy: processes of knowing (called the \"I-self\") and the resulting knowledge about the self (the \"Me-self\").The observation about the self and storage of those observations by the I-self creates three types of knowledge, which collectively account for the Me-self,

constituent of the FTSE 100 Index..The company was founded in 1826 as a partnership between members of the Pilkington and Greenall families, based in St Helens, Lancashire (now Merseyside), England.[1] The venture used the trading name of St Helens Crown Glass Company.[2] On the departure from the partnership of the last Greenall in 1845, the firm became known as Pilkington Brothers.[3] In 1894, the business was incorporated under the Companies Act 1862 as Pilkington Brothers Limited.[4].Pilkington was floated as a public company on the London Stock Exchange in 1970.[5] It was for many years the biggest employer in the northwest industrial town.The distinctive blue-glass head office tower block on Alexandra Business Park, off Prescot Road, used as the firm's world HQ, and completed in 1964, still dominates the town's skyline..Between 1953 and 1957, Pilkington employees Alastair Pilkington (no family relation) and Kenneth Bickerstaff invented the float glass process, a revolutionary method of high-quality flat glass production by floating molten glass over a bath of molten tin, avoiding the costly need to grind and polish plate glass to make it clear.[2] Pilkington then allowed the Float Process to be used under licence by numerous manufacturers around the world..Pilkington, with its subsidiary Triplex Safety Glass, in which it gradually acquired a controlling interest, also became a major world supplier of toughened and laminated safety glass to the automotive, aerospace and building industries.[2].During the 1960s and 1970s, Pilkington used the flow of Float royalties to invest in float glass plants in several countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada and Sweden, and also to acquire major existing flat and safety glass producers and plants in the United States (Libbey Owens Ford), Germany and France..A Monopolies Commission report in 1967, concluded that Pilkington and Triplex operations were efficient and entrepreneurial and, despite their high share of the UK glass trade, operated in a manner suited to consumers' best interests.[2].A rank-and-file strike in 1970, sparked off by an error in wage packets, brought 8,000 workers out

accessible settings.These interventions are designed to help individuals with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school and in their community, which may not be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education..Special education aims to provide accommodated education for disabled students such as learning disabilities, learning difficulties (such as dyslexia), communication disorders, emotional and behavioral disorders, physical disabilities (such as osteogenesis imperfecta, cerebral palsy, lissencephaly,

example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, paper cups or similar items.The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the voice sounds for reproduction at a distance.One precursor to the development of the electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when Carl Friedrich Gauss

peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination..Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule.Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor.He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest.Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400km (250mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling

organisms that produces the gametes, such as sperm or egg cells.It involves two rounds of division that ultimately result in four cells with only one copy of each chromosome (haploid).Additionally, prior to the division, genetic material from the paternal and maternal copies of each chromosome is crossed over, creating new combinations of code on each chromosome.[3] Later on, during fertilisation, the haploid cells produced by meiosis from a male and a female will fuse to create a cell with two copies of each chromosome again, the zygote..Errors in meiosis resulting in aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes) are the leading known cause of miscarriage and the most frequent genetic cause of developmental disabilities.[4].In meiosis, DNA replication is followed by two rounds of cell division to produce four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the original parent cell.[3] The two meiotic divisions are known as meiosis I and meiosis II.Before meiosis begins, during S phase of the cell cycle, the DNA of each chromosome is replicated so that it consists of two identical sister chromatids, which remain held together through sister chromatid cohesion.This S-phase can be referred to as \"premeiotic S-phase\" or \"meiotic S-phase\".Immediately following DNA replication, meiotic cells enter a prolonged G2-like stage known as meiotic prophase.During this time, homologous chromosomes pair with each other and undergo genetic recombination, a programmed process in which DNA may be cut and then repaired, which allows them to exchange some of their genetic information.A subset of recombination events results in crossovers, which create physical links known as chiasmata (singular: chiasma, for the Greek letter Chi (\u03a7)) between the homologous chromosomes.In most organisms, these links can help direct each pair of homologous chromosomes to segregate away from each other during meiosis I, resulting in two haploid cells that have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell..During meiosis II, the cohesion between sister chromatids is released and they segregate from one another, as during mitosis.\nQ: how many cells

category (such as gender or person) \"agree\" between varied words or parts of the sentence..For example, in Standard English, one may say I am or he is, but not \"I is\" or \"he am\".This is because English grammar requires that the verb and its subject agree in person.The pronouns I and he are first and third person respectively, as are the verb forms am and is.The verb form must be selected so that it has the same person as the subject in contrast to notional agreement, which is based on meaning.[2][3].Agreement generally involves matching the value of some grammatical category between different constituents of a sentence (or sometimes between sentences, as in some cases where a pronoun is required to agree with its antecedent or referent).Some categories that commonly trigger grammatical agreement are noted below..Agreement based on grammatical person is found mostly between verb and subject.An example from English (I am vs.he is) has been given in the introduction to this article..Agreement between pronoun (or corresponding possessive adjective) and antecedent also requires the selection of the correct person.For example, if the antecedent is the first person noun

volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater.For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates.Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande rift in North America.Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs from the core\u2013mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers (1,900mi) deep in the Earth.This results in hotspot volcanism, of which the Hawaiian hotspot is an example.Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another..Large eruptions can affect atmospheric temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the Sun and cool the Earth's troposphere.Historically, large volcanic eruptions have been followed by volcanic winters which have caused catastrophic famines.[1].Other planets besides Earth have volcanoes.For example, volcanoes are very numerous on Venus.[2].The word volcano is derived from the name of Vulcano, a volcanic island in the Aeolian Islands of Italy whose name in turn comes from Vulcan, the god of fire in Roman mythology.[3] The study

"label": 0, "input": "Context: A pothole is a depression in a road surface, usually asphalt pavement, where traffic has removed broken pieces of the pavement.It is usually the result of water in the underlying soil structure and traffic passing over the affected area.Water first weakens the underlying soil; traffic then fatigues and breaks the poorly supported asphalt surface in the affected area.Continued traffic action ejects both asphalt and the underlying soil material to create a hole in the pavement.[1].According to the US Army Corps of Engineers's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, pothole formation requires two factors to be present at the same time: water and traffic.Water weakens the soil beneath the pavement while traffic applies the loads that stress the pavement past the breaking point.Potholes form progressively from fatigue of the road surface which can lead to a precursor failure pattern known as crocodile (or alligator) cracking.[2] Eventually, chunks of pavement between the fatigue cracks gradually work loose, and may then be plucked or forced out of the surface by continued wheel loads to create a pothole.[3].In areas subject to freezing and thawing, frost heaving can damage a pavement and create openings for water to enter.In the spring, thaw of pavements accelerates this process when the thawing of upper portions of the soil structure in a pavement cannot drain past still-frozen lower layers, thus saturating the supporting soil and weakening it.[3].Potholes can grow to several feet in width, though they usually only develop to depths of a few inches.If they become large enough, damage to tires, wheels, and vehicle suspensions is liable to occur.Serious road accidents can occur as a direct result, especially on those roads where vehicle speeds are greater.[3].\nQ: How is the pothole formed\nReasoning: A deep pothole on New York City's Second Avenue"}, {"question_id": "Q516", "question": "how much more time

"Context: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine.RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 90\u201395% of cases.[1] RCC occurrence shows a male predominance over women with a ratio of 1.5:1.RCC most commonly occurs between 6th and 7th decade of life.[2].Initial treatment is most commonly either partial or complete removal of the affected kidney(s).[3] Where the cancer has not metastasised (spread to other organs) or burrowed deeper into the tissues of the kidney, the five-year survival rate is 65\u201390%,[4] but this is lowered considerably when the cancer has spread..The body is remarkably good at hiding the symptoms and as a result people with RCC often have advanced disease by the time it is discovered.[5] The initial symptoms of RCC often include blood in the urine (occurring in 40% of affected persons at the time they first seek medical attention), flank pain (40%), a mass in the abdomen or flank (25%), weight loss (33%), fever (20%), high blood pressure (20%), night sweats and generally feeling unwell.[1] When RCC metastasises, it most commonly spreads to the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, adrenal glands, brain or bones.[6] Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have improved the outlook for metastatic RCC.[7][8].RCC is also associated with a number of paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) which are conditions caused by either the hormones produced by the tumour or by the body's attack on the tumour and are present in about 20% of those with RCC.[1] These syndromes most commonly affect tissues which have not been invaded by the cancer.[1] The most common PNSs seen in people with RCC are: high blood calcium levels, high red blood cell count, high platelet count and secondary amyloidosis.[6].Historically, medical practitioners expected a person to present with three findings.This classic triad[9] is 1: haematuria, which is when there is blood present in the urine, 2: flank pain, which is pain on the side of the body between the hip and ribs, and 3: an abdominal mass, similar to bloating but larger.It is now known that this classic triad of symptoms only occurs in 10\u201315% of cases, and is usually indicative that the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is in an advanced stage.[9] Today, RCC is often asymptomatic (meaning few to no symptoms) and is generally detected incidentally when a person is being examined for other ailments.[10].Other signs and symptom may include haematuria;[9] loin pain;[9] abdominal mass;[10] malaise, which is a general feeling of unwellness;[10] weight loss and/or loss of appetite;[11] anaemia resulting from depression of erythropoietin;[9] erythrocytosis (increased production of red blood cells) due to increased erythropoietin secretion;[9] varicocele, which is seen in males as an enlargement of the pampiniform plexus of veins draining the testis (more often the left testis)[10] hypertension (high blood pressure) resulting from secretion of renin by the tumour;[12] hypercalcemia, which is elevation of calcium levels in the blood;[13] sleep disturbance or night sweats;[11] recurrent fevers;[11] and chronic fatigue.[14].The greatest risk factors for RCC are lifestyle-related; smoking, obesity and hypertension (high blood pressure) have been estimated to account for up to 50% of cases.[15].Occupational exposure to some chemicals such as asbestos, cadmium, lead, chlorinated solvents, petrochemicals and PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has been examined by multiple studies with inconclusive results.[16][17][18].\nQ: how much more time does chemo give to people with renal

0, "input": "Context: A solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, and functions as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage.[1] It is also sometimes called a semiconductor storage device, a solid-state device, or a solid-state disk,[2] even though SSDs lack the physical spinning disks and movable read\u2013write heads used in hard disk drives (HDDs) and floppy disks.[3] SSD also has rich internal parallelism for data processing.[4].In comparison to hard disk drives and similar electromechanical media which use moving parts, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run silently, and have higher input/output rates and lower latency.[5] SSDs store data in semiconductor cells.As of 2019,[update] cells can contain between 1 and 4 bits of data.SSD storage devices vary in their properties according to the number of bits stored in each cell, with single-bit cells (\"Single Level Cells\" or \"SLC\") being generally the most reliable, durable, fast, and expensive type, compared with 2- and 3-bit cells (\"Multi-Level Cells/MLC\" and \"Triple-Level Cells/TLC\"), and finally, quad-bit cells (\"QLC\") being used for consumer devices that do not require such extreme properties and are the cheapest per gigabyte (GB) of the four.In addition, 3D XPoint memory (sold by Intel under the Optane brand) stores data by changing the electrical resistance of cells instead of storing electrical charges in cells, and SSDs made from RAM can be used for high speed, when data persistence after power loss is not required, or may use battery power to retain data when its usual power source is unavailable.[6] Hybrid drives or solid-state hybrid drives (SSHDs), such as Intel's Hystor[7] and Apple's Fusion Drive, combine features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit using both flash memory and spinning magnetic disks in order to improve the performance of frequently-accessed data.[8][9][10] Bcache achieves a similar effect purely in software, using combinations of dedicated regular SSDs and HDDs..SSDs based on NAND flash will slowly leak charge over time if left for long periods without power.This causes worn-out drives (that have exceeded their endurance rating) to start losing data typically after one year (if stored at 30\u00b0C) to two years (at 25\u00b0C) in storage; for new drives it takes longer.[11] Therefore, SSDs are not suitable for archival storage.3D XPoint is a possible exception to this rule; it is a relatively new technology with unknown long-term data-retention characteristics..SSDs can use traditional HDD interfaces and form factors, or newer interfaces and form factors that exploit specific advantages of the flash memory in SSDs.Traditional interfaces (e.g.SATA and SAS) and standard HDD form factors allow such SSDs to be used as drop-in replacements for HDDs in computers and other devices.Newer form factors such as mSATA, M.2, U.2, NF1/M.3/NGSFF,[12][13] XFM Express (Crossover Flash Memory, form factor XT2)[14] and EDSFF (formerly known as Ruler SSD)[15][16] and higher speed

cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent.\"[10] Some of the noted differences were a higher life expectancy in Canada, as well as a lower infant mortality rate than the United States..One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health Organization's ratings of \"overall health service performance\", which used a \"composite measure of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution\", ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations.This study rated the US \"responsiveness\", or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment, as 1st, compared with 7th for Canada.\nQ: how much does U.S. pay on health care per person\nReasoning: Health spending

associated with shock waves created when an object travels through the air faster than the speed of sound.Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy, sounding similar to an explosion or a thunderclap to the human ear..The crack of a supersonic bullet passing overhead or the crack of a bullwhip are examples of a sonic boom in miniature.[2].Sonic booms due to large supersonic aircraft can be particularly loud and startling, tend to awaken people, and may cause minor damage to some structures.This led to the prohibition of routine supersonic flight overland.Although they cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle, the nuisance due to the sonic booms may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a feasible option.[3][4].A sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the sound barrier and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the supersonic object.Rather, the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is traveling at supersonic speeds and affects only observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object.As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the observer, they will briefly experience the \"boom\"..When an aircraft passes through the air, it creates a series of pressure waves in front of the aircraft and behind it, similar to the bow and stern waves created by a boat.These waves travel at the speed of sound and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other's way quickly enough.Eventually, they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as Mach 1, and is approximately 1,192km/h (741mph) at sea level and 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F)..\nQ: what creates sonic boom\nReasoning: The sound source has now

transmits digital data, usually an identifying inventory number, back to the reader.This number can be used to track inventory goods.[1].Passive tags are powered by energy from the RFID reader's interrogating radio waves.Active tags are powered by a battery and thus can be read at a greater range from the RFID reader, up to hundreds of meters..Unlike a barcode, the tag does not need to be

example, an RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line, RFID-tagged pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses, and implanting RFID microchips in livestock and pets enables positive identification of animals.[3][4] Tags can also be used in shops to expedite checkout, and to prevent theft by customers and

three distinct, interacting agents in the psychic apparatus, defined in Sigmund Freud's structural model of the psyche.The three agents are theoretical constructs that Freud employed to describe the basic structure of mental life as it was encountered in psychoanalytic practice.Freud himself used the German terms das Es, Ich, and \u00dcber-Ich, which literally translate as \"the it\", \"I\", and \"over-I\".The Latin terms id, ego and super-ego were chosen by his original translators and have remained in use..In the ego psychology model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual desires; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic agent that mediates between the instinctual desires of the id and the critical super-ego;[1] Freud compared the ego (in its relation to the id) to a man on horseback: the rider must harness and direct the superior energy of his mount, and at times allow for a practicable satisfaction of its urges.The ego is thus \"in the habit of transforming the id's will into action, as if it were its own.\"[2].Freud introduced the structural model (id, ego, super-ego) in the essay Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920) in response to the unstructured ambiguity and conflicting uses of the term \"the unconscious mind\".He elaborated, refined, and formalised that model in the essay The Ego and the Id (1923).[3].The terms \"id\", \"ego\", and \"super-ego\" are not Freud's own; they are latinisations by his translator James Strachey.Freud himself wrote of \"das Es\",[4] \"das Ich\",[5]  and \"das \u00dcber-Ich\"[6]\u2014respectively, \"the It\", \"the I\", and \"the Over-I\".Thus, to the German reader, Freud's original terms are to some degree self-explanatory.The term \"das Es\" was originally used by Georg Groddeck, a physician whose unconventional ideas were of interest to Freud (Groddeck's translators render the term in English as \"the It\").[7] The word ego is

eye contact is sometimes known as oculesics.[3].Eye contact and facial expressions provide important social and emotional information.People, perhaps without consciously doing so, search other's eyes and faces for positive or negative mood signs.In some contexts, the meeting of eyes arouses strong emotions..Eye contact provides some of the strongest emotions during a social conversation.This primarily is because it provides details on emotions and intentions.In a group, if eye contact is not inclusive of a certain individual, it can make that individual feel left out of the group; while on the other hand, prolonged eye contact can tell someone you are interested in what they have to say.[4].Eye contact is also an important element in flirting, where it may serve to establish and gauge the other's interest in some situations.Mutual eye contact that signals attraction initially begins as a brief glance and progresses into a repeated volleying of eye contact.[5].In the process

"Bed bugs are parasitic insects of the cimicid family that feed exclusively on blood .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Bed bugs are parasitic insects from the genus Cimex, who are micropredators that feed on blood, usually at night.[7] Their bites can result in a number of health impacts including skin rashes, psychological effects, and allergic symptoms.[5] Bed bug bites may lead to skin changes ranging from small areas of redness to prominent blisters.[1][2] Symptoms may take between minutes to days to appear and itchiness is generally present.[2] Some individuals may feel tired or have a fever.[2] Typically, uncovered areas of the body are affected.[2] Their bites are not known to transmit any infectious disease.[5][7][8] Complications may rarely include areas of dead skin or vasculitis.[2].Bed bug bites are caused primarily by two species of insects: Cimex lectularius (the common bed bug) and Cimex hemipterus, found primarily in the tropics.[3] Their size ranges between 1 and 7mm.[7] They spread by crawling between nearby locations or by being carried within personal items.[2] Infestation is rarely due to a lack of hygiene but is more common in high-density areas.[2][9] Diagnosis involves both finding the bugs and the occurrence of compatible symptoms.[5] Bed bugs spend much of their time in dark, hidden locations like mattress seams, or cracks in a wall.[2].Treatment is directed towards the symptoms.[2] Eliminating bed bugs from the home is often difficult, partly because bed bugs can survive up to approximately 300 days without feeding.[6][8] Repeated treatments of a home may be required.[2] These treatments may include heating the room to 50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F) for more than 90 minutes, frequent vacuuming, washing clothing at high temperatures, and the use of various pesticides.[2].Fossils found in Egypt show bed bugs have been known as human parasites for at least 3,500 years.[10] Despite being nearly eradicated in developed countries after WW2, infestations have increased since the 1990s and bed bugs are now relatively common in all regions of the globe.[7][3][4][6] The exact causes of this increase are unclear; theories include increased human travel, more frequent exchange of second-hand furnishings, a greater focus on control of other pests, and increasing resistance to pesticides.[4].Bed bugs infest dwellings and bite people, causing irritation and sometimes other issues.There is no evidence that bed bugs transmit infectious diseases[5][7] even though they appear physically capable of carrying pathogens and this possibility has been investigated.[3][5].The most common skin findings associated with bed bug bites are itching, flat and bumpy, reddish lesions.[8] Each lesion is about 2\u20135mm (0.08\u20130.2in) but may be as large as 2cm (0.8in) in diameter and there may or may not be a central spot (punctum).[8] Bites are usually present on areas of exposed skin, especially exposed areas not covered by sheets or blankets, such as arms, legs, feet, face or neck.[8] Individual responses to bites vary, ranging from no visible effect (in about 20\u201370%),[3][5] to small flat (macular) spots, to the formation of prominent blisters (wheals and bullae) along with intense itching that may last several days.[5] Vesicles and nodules may also form.The lesions due to bites may become secondarily infected due to scratching but systemic effects from bed bug bites are very rare.[8] A central spot of bleeding may also occur due to the release of blood thinning substances in the bug's saliva.[4].Symptoms may not appear until some days after the bites have occurred.[5] Reactions often become brisker after multiple bites due to possible sensitization to the salivary proteins of the bed bug.[3] Numerous bites may lead to a red rash or hives.[5].Bedbug bites may cause other symptoms and health issues.Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis from the injection of serum and other non-specific proteins have been documented, though rarely.[5][11] As each bite takes a tiny amount of blood, chronic or severe infestation may lead to anemia.[5] Scratching bites may lead to bacterial skin infection.[5][12] Systemic poisoning may occur if the bites are numerous.[13] The bite itself may be painful thus resulting in poor sleep and worse work performance.[5].Bed bugs can feed on warm-blooded animals other than humans, such as pets.\nQ: how do you get bed bugs\nReasoning: Bed bugs are parasitic insects of the cimicid family that feed exclusively on blood ."},

the Christian Old Testament.[1] It is identified by a superscription as the words of the 8th-century BCE prophet Isaiah ben Amoz, but there is evidence that much of it was composed during the Babylonian captivity and later.[2] Johann Christoph D\u00f6derlein suggested in 1775 that the book contained the works of two prophets separated by more than a century,[3] and Bernhard Duhm originated the view, held as a consensus through most of the 20th century, that the book comprises three separate collections of oracles:[4][5] Proto-Isaiah (chapters 1\u201339), containing the words of the 8th-century BCE prophet Isaiah; Deutero-Isaiah (chapters 40\u201355), the work of an anonymous 6th-century BCE author writing during the Exile; and Trito-Isaiah (chapters 56\u201366), composed after the return from Exile.[6] Isaiah 1\u201333 promises judgment and restoration for Judah, Jerusalem and the nations, and chapters 34\u201366 presume that judgment has been pronounced and restoration follows soon.[7] While few scholars today attribute the entire book, or even most of it, to one person,[4] the book's essential unity has become a focus in more recent research.[8].The book can be read as an extended meditation on the destiny of Jerusalem into and after the Exile.[9].The Deutero-Isaian part of the book describes how God will make Jerusalem the centre of his worldwide rule through a royal saviour (a messiah) who will destroy the oppressor (Babylon); this messiah is the Persian king Cyrus the Great, who is merely the agent who brings about Yahweh's kingship.[10] Isaiah speaks out against corrupt leaders and for the disadvantaged, and roots righteousness in God's holiness rather than in Israel's covenant.[11].Isaiah was one of the most popular works among Jews in the Second Temple period (c.515 BCE \u2013 70 CE).[12] In Christian circles, it was held in such high regard as to be called \"the Fifth Gospel\",[13] and its influence extends beyond Christianity to English literature and to Western culture in general, from the libretto of Handel's Messiah to a host of such everyday phrases as \"swords into ploughshares\" and \"voice in the wilderness\".[14].General scholarly consensus through most of the 20th century saw three separate collections of oracles in the book of Isaiah.[4] A typical outline based on this understanding of the book sees its underlying structure in terms of the identification of historical figures who might have been their authors:[15].While one part of the general consensus still holds, this perception of Isaiah as made up of three rather distinct sections underwent a radical challenge in the last quarter of the 20th century.[17] The newer approach looks at the book in terms of its literary and formal characteristics, rather than authors, and sees in it a two-part structure divided between chapters 33 and 34:[18].Seeing Isaiah as a two-part book (chapters 1\u201333 and 34\u201366) with an overarching theme leads to a summary of its contents like the following:[10].The older understanding of this book as three fairly discrete sections attributable to identifiable authors leads to a more atomised picture of its contents, as in this example:.While it is widely accepted that the book of Isaiah is rooted in a historic prophet called Isaiah, who lived in the Kingdom of Judah during the 8th century BCE, it is also widely accepted that this prophet did not write the entire book of Isaiah.[9][22].The composition history of Isaiah reflects a major difference in the way authorship was regarded in ancient Israel and in modern societies; the ancients did not regard it as inappropriate to supplement an existing work while remaining anonymous.[26] While the authors are anonymous, it is plausible that all of them were priests, and the book may thus reflect Priestly concerns, in opposition to the increasingly successful reform movement of the Deuteronomists.[27].The historic Isaiah ben Amoz lived in the Kingdom of Judah during the reigns of four kings from the mid to late 8th-century BCE.[22][29] During this period, Assyria was expanding westward from its origins in modern-day northern Iraq towards the Mediterranean, destroying first Aram (modern Syria) in 734\u2013732 BCE, then the Kingdom of Israel in 722\u2013721, and finally subjugating Judah in 701.[30] Proto-Isaiah is divided between verse and prose passages, and a currently popular theory is that the verse passages represent the prophecies of the original 8th-century Isaiah, while the prose sections are \"sermons\" on his texts composed at the court of Josiah a hundred years later, at the end of the 7th century.[31].\nQ: what does it mean when isaiah of the bible in chapter 55:verses 8,9

as an expulsion of fluid from the Skene's gland at the lower end of the urethra during or before an orgasm.It is also known colloquially as squirting (or gushing), although research indicates that female ejaculation and squirting are different phenomena,  squirting being attributed to a sudden expulsion of liquid that partly comes from the bladder and contains urine.[1][2].Female ejaculation is physiologically distinct from coital incontinence, with which it is sometimes confused.[3][4].There have been few studies on female ejaculation.[5] A failure to adopt common definitions and research methodology by the scientific community has been the primary contributor to this lack of experimental data.[6] Research has suffered from highly selected participants, narrow case studies, or very small sample sizes, and consequently has yet to produce significant results.Much of the research into the composition of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is, or contains, urine.[5][7] It is common for any secretion that exits the vagina, and for fluid that exits the urethra, during sexual activity to be referred to as female ejaculate, which has led to significant confusion in the literature.[7].Whether the fluid is secreted by the Skene's gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals, and are related to doubts over the existence of the G-spot,[8][9][7] there is substantial evidence that the Skene's gland is the source of female ejaculation.[1][7] The function of female ejaculation, however, remains unclear.[7].In questionnaire surveys, 35\u201350% of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm.[10][11][12] Other studies find anywhere from 10 to 69%, depending on the definitions and methods used.[13][14] For instance Kratochv\u00edl (1994) surveyed 200 women and found that 6% reported ejaculating, an additional 13% had some experience and about 60% reported release of fluid without actual gushing.[15] Reports on the volume of fluid expelled vary considerably, starting from amounts that would be imperceptible to a woman, to mean values of 1\u20135 ml.[16].The suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women's health writer Rebecca Chalker as \"one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology\".[17] Female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical, medical, and biological literature throughout recorded history.The reasons for the interest in female ejaculation have been questioned by feminist writers.[18].In the 16th century, the Dutch physician Laevinius Lemnius, referred to how a woman \"draws forth the man's seed and casts her own with it\".[19] In the 17th century, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriceau described glands at the female urethral meatus that \"pour out great quantities of saline liquor during coition, which increases the heat and enjoyment of women\".[20] This century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function,[21] in particular the work of the Bartholin family in Denmark..In the 17th century, the Dutch anatomist Reinier de Graaf wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs Concerning the Generative Organs of Women which is much cited in the literature on this topic.De Graaf discussed the original controversy but supported the Aristotelian view.[22][23] He identified the source as the glandular structures and ducts

bat.Innings also means the period in which an individual player bats (acts as either striker or nonstriker).In cricket and rounders, \"innings\" is both singular and plural; this contrasts with baseball and softball in which the singular is \"inning\"..The earliest known record of the term concerns a match in August 1730 at Blackheath, Kent between a Kent side and London Cricket Club.The London-based St.James Evening Post reported: \"'Twas thought that the Kentish champions would have lost their honours by being beat at one innings if time had permitted\".[1][2].An innings is one of

meaning of \"score\" for both the team and each individual batsman.For example, it may be said that \"he played an innings of 101\", meaning that the player scored 101 runs in his innings (while batting during one of the team's innings).Similarly, it may be said that the team had a first innings (score) of 501.[5].The term can generally be taken as a reference to the time during which someone

"input": "Context: Poverty is a state or condition in which one lacks the financial resources and essentials for a certain standard of living.Poverty can have diverse social, economic, and political causes and effects.[1] When evaluating poverty in statistics or economics there are two main measures: absolute poverty compares income against the amount needed to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter;[2] relative poverty measures when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place.The definition of relative poverty varies from one country to another, or from one society to another.[2].Statistically, as of 2019[update], most of the world's population live in poverty: in PPP dollars, 85% of people live on less than $30 per day, two-thirds live on less than $10 per day, and 10% live on less than $1.90 per day.[3] According to the World Bank Group in 2020, more than 40% of the poor live in conflict-affected countries.[4] Even when countries experience economic development, the poorest citizens of middle-income countries frequently do not gain an adequate share of their countries' increased wealth to leave poverty.[5] Governments and non-governmental organizations have experimented with a number of different policies and programs for poverty alleviation, such as electrification in rural areas or housing first policies in urban areas.The international policy frameworks for poverty alleviation, established by the United Nations in 2015, are summarized in Sustainable Development Goal 1: \"No Poverty\"..Social forces, such as gender, disability, race and ethnicity, can exacerbate issues of poverty\u2014with women, children and minorities frequently bearing unequal burdens of poverty.Moreover, impoverished individuals are more vulnerable to the effects of other social issues, such as the environmental effects of industry or the impacts of climate change or other natural disasters or extreme weather events.Poverty can also make other social problems worse; economic pressures on impoverished communities frequently play a part in deforestation, biodiversity loss and ethnic conflict.For this reason, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and other international policy programs, such as the international recovery from COVID-19, emphasize the connection of poverty alleviation with other societal goals.[6].The word poverty comes from the old (Norman) French word povert\u00e9 (Modern French: pauvret\u00e9), from Latin paupert\u0101s from pauper (poor).[7].There are several definitions of poverty depending on the context of the situation it is placed in.It usually references a state or condition in which a person or community lacks the

part, of an ethnic, racial, religious, or national group.The term was coined in 1944 by Raphael Lemkin.It is defined in Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) of 1948 as \"any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group's conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\"[1].The preamble to the CPPCG states that \"genocide is a crime under international law, contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world\", and it also states that \"at all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity.\"[1].The debate continues over what legally constitutes genocide.One definition is any conflict that the International Criminal Court has so designated.Mohammed Hassan Kakar argues that the definition should include political groups or any group so defined by the perpetrator.[2] He prefers the definition from Frank Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn, which defines genocide as \"a form of one-sided mass killing in which a state or other authority intends to destroy a group so defined by the perpetrator.\"[3].In literature, some scholars have popularly emphasized the role that the Soviet Union played in excluding political groups from the international definition of genocide, which is contained in the Genocide Convention of 1948,[4] and in particular they have written that Joseph Stalin may have feared greater international scrutiny of the political killings that occurred in the country, such as the Great Purge;[5] however, this claim is not supported by evidence.The Soviet view was shared and supported by many diverse countries, and they were also in line with Raphael Lemkin's original conception,[a] and it was originally promoted by the World Jewish Congress.[7].Analysis of genocides before World War I is the result of modern studies that apply objectivity and fact, while previous accounts of genocides mostly aimed to emphasize one's own superiority.According to Frank Chalk, Helen Fein, and Kurt Jonassohn, if a dominant group of people had little in common with a marginalized group of people, it was easy for the dominant group to define the marginalized group as a subhuman group; the marginalized group might be labeled a threat that must be eliminated.[8].While the concept of genocide was formulated by Lemkin in the mid-20th century, the expansion of various European colonial powers, such as the British and the Spanish Empires, and the subsequent establishment of colonies on indigenous territory frequently involved acts of genocidal violence against indigenous groups in the Americas, Australia, Africa, and Asia.[9] According to Lemkin, colonization was in itself \"intrinsically genocidal\", and he saw this genocide as a two-stage process, the first being the destruction of the indigenous population's way of life.\nQ: how many native Americans did the United States kill or deport?\nReasoning: Genocide is a term

consumed as food are known as roe or caviar..Chickens and other egg-laying creatures are raised throughout the world, and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry.In 2009, an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens.[3] There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation, as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production.In 2012, the European Union banned battery husbandry of chickens..Bird eggs have been valuable foodstuffs since prehistory, in both hunting societies and more recent cultures where birds were domesticated.The chicken was most likely domesticated for its eggs (from jungle fowl native to tropical and subtropical Southeast Asia and Indian subcontinent) before 7500 BCE.Chickens were brought to Sumer and Egypt by 1500 BCE, and arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the quail had been the primary source of eggs.[4] In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, dating to approximately 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs, presumably those of the pelican, as offerings.[5] In ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods and meals often started with an egg course.[5] The Romans crushed the shells in their plates to prevent evil spirits from hiding there.[6].In the Middle Ages, eggs were forbidden during Lent because of their richness,[6] although the motivation for forgoing eggs during Lent was not entirely religious.An annual pause in egg consumption allowed farmers

the United States' successful bid to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[7] The inaugural season took place in 1996 with ten teams.[8] MLS experienced financial and operational struggles in its first few years, losing millions of dollars and folding two teams in 2002.[9] Since then, developments such as the proliferation of soccer-specific stadiums around the league, implementation of the Designated

cardiovascular physiology , ejection fraction (EF) represents the volumetric fraction of blood pumped out of the ventricle (heart) with each heart beat or cardiac cycle .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: An ejection fraction (EF) is the volumetric fraction (or portion of the total) of fluid (usually blood) ejected from a chamber (usually the heart) with each contraction (or heartbeat).It can refer to the cardiac atrium,[1] ventricle,[2] gall bladder,[3] or leg veins,[4] although if unspecified it usually refers to the left ventricle of the heart.EF is widely used as a measure of the pumping efficiency of the heart and is used to classify heart failure types.It is also used as an indicator of the severity of heart failure, although it has recognized limitations.[5].The EF of the left heart, known as the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), is calculated by dividing the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle per beat (stroke volume) by the volume of blood present in the left ventricle at the end of diastolic filling (end-diastolic volume).LVEF is an indicator of the effectiveness of pumping into the systemic circulation.The EF of the right heart, or right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), is a measure of the efficiency of pumping into the pulmonary circulation.A heart which cannot pump sufficient blood to meet the body's requirements (i.e., heart failure) will often, but not invariably, have a reduced ventricular ejection fraction.[6].In heart failure, the difference between heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, and heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction, is significant, because the two types are treated differently..Modalities applied to measurement of ejection fraction is an emerging field of medical mathematics and subsequent computational applications.The first common measurement method is echocardiography,[7][8] although cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),[8][9] cardiac computed tomography,[8][9] ventriculography and nuclear medicine (gated SPECT and radionuclide angiography)[8][10] scans may also be used.Measurements by different modalities are not easily interchangeable.[11] Historically, the gold standard for measurement of the ejection fraction was ventriculography,[12] but cardiac MRI is now considered the best method.[13] Prior to these more advanced techniques, the combination of electrocardiography and phonocardiography was used to accurately estimate ejection fraction.[14].\nQ: how is the ejection fraction measured\nReasoning: In cardiovascular physiology , ejection fraction

blindness respectively are often used.In the absence of treatment such as corrective eyewear, assistive devices, and medical treatment \u2013 visual impairment may cause the individual difficulties with normal daily tasks including reading and walking.[6] In addition to the various permanent conditions, fleeting temporary vision impairment, amaurosis fugax, may occur, and may indicate serious medical problems.[7][8][9].The most common causes of visual impairment globally are uncorrected refractive errors (43%), cataracts (33%), and glaucoma (2%).[1] Refractive errors include near-sightedness, far-sightedness, presbyopia, and astigmatism.[1] Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness.[1] Other disorders that may cause visual problems include age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal clouding, childhood blindness, and a number of infections.[10] Visual impairment can also be caused by problems in the brain due to stroke, premature birth, or trauma, among others.[11] These cases are known as cortical visual impairment.[11] Screening for vision problems in children may improve future vision and educational achievement.[12] Screening adults without symptoms is of uncertain benefit.[13] Diagnosis is by an eye exam.[2].The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of visual impairment is either preventable or curable with treatment.[1] This includes cataracts, the infections river blindness and trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uncorrected refractive errors, and some cases of childhood blindness.[14] Many people with significant visual impairment benefit from vision rehabilitation, changes in their environment, and assistive devices.[2].As of 2015[update], there were 940 million people with some degree of vision loss.[5] 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind.[1] The majority of people with poor vision are in the developing world and are over the age of 50 years.[1] Rates of visual impairment have decreased since the 1990s.[1] Visual impairments have considerable economic costs both directly due to the cost of treatment and indirectly due to decreased ability to work.[15].In 2010, the WHO definition for visual impairment was changed and now follows the ICD-11.The previous definition which used \"best corrected visual acuity\" was changed to \"presenting visual acuity\".This change was made as newer studies showed that best-corrected vision overlooks a larger proportion of the population who has visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive errors, and/or

divided into two processes based on how food is broken down: mechanical and chemical digestion.The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes.Mechanical digestion takes place in the mouth through mastication and in the small intestine through segmentation contractions.In chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small compounds that the body can use..In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva.Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work, and

\"rule\" or \"measuring stick\".The use of the word \"canon\" to refer to a set of religious scriptures was first used by David Ruhnken, in the 18th century.[1].Various biblical canons have developed through debate and agreement on the part of the religious authorities of their respective faiths and denominations.Some books, such as the Jewish\u2013Christian gospels, have been excluded from various canons altogether, but many disputed books are considered to be biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical by many, while some denominations may consider them fully canonical.Differences exist between the Hebrew Bible and Christian biblical canons, although the majority of manuscripts are shared in common..Different religious groups include different books in their biblical canons, in varying orders, and sometimes divide or combine books.The Jewish Tanakh (sometimes called the Hebrew Bible) contains 24 books divided into three parts: the five books of the Torah (\"teaching\"); the eight books of the Nevi'im (\"prophets\"); and the eleven books of Ketuvim (\"writings\").It is composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew.The Septuagint (in Koine Greek), which closely resembles the Hebrew Bible but includes additional texts, is used as the Christian Greek Old Testament, at least in some liturgical contexts.The first part of Christian Bibles is the Old Testament, which contains, at minimum, the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible but divided into 39 (Protestant) or 46 (Catholic) books (including deuterocanonical works) and ordered differently.The second part is the New Testament,

masts), spans (bridges), and earth (cliffs).[1][2] Participants exit from a fixed object such as a cliff, and after an optional freefall delay, deploy a parachute to slow their descent and land.A popular form of BASE jumping is wingsuit BASE jumping..In contrast to other forms of parachuting, such as skydiving from airplanes, BASE jumps are performed from fixed objects which are generally at much lower altitudes, and BASE jumpers only carry one parachute..BASE jumping is significantly more hazardous than other forms of parachuting, and is widely considered to be one of the most dangerous extreme sports.[3].Fausto Veranzio is widely believed to have been the first person to build and test a parachute,[4] by jumping from St Mark's Campanile in Venice in 1617 when he was over 65 years old.[5] However, these and other sporadic incidents were one-time experiments, not the actual systematic pursuit of a new form of parachuting..There are precursors to the sport dating back hundreds of years.[citation needed] In 1966, Michael Pelkey and Brian Schubert jumped from El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.[6] The acronym \"B.A.S.E.\" (now more commonly \"BASE\") was later coined by filmmaker Carl Boenish, his wife Jean Boenish, Phil Smith, and Phil Mayfield.[7] Carl Boenish was an important catalyst behind modern BASE jumping, and in 1978 he filmed jumps from El Capitan, made using ram-air parachutes and the freefall tracking technique.[8] While BASE jumps had been made prior to that time, the El Capitan activity was the effective birth of what is now called BASE jumping..After 1978, the filmed jumps from El Capitan were repeated, not as an actual publicity exercise or as a movie stunt, but as a true recreational activity.It was this that popularized BASE jumping more widely among parachutists.[9] Carl Boenish continued to publish films and informational magazines on BASE jumping until his death in 1984 after a BASE jump off the Troll Wall.By this time, the concept had spread among skydivers worldwide, with hundreds of participants making fixed-object jumps..During the early eighties, nearly all BASE jumps were made using standard skydiving equipment, including two parachutes (main and reserve), and deployment components.Later on, specialized equipment and techniques were developed specifically for the unique needs of BASE jumping..\nQ:

rats).[2][3].The corresponding formation hanging down from the ceiling of a cave is a stalactite.Mnemonics have been developed for which word refers to which type of formation; one is that stalactite has a C for \"ceiling\", and stalagmite has a G for \"ground\",[4] another is that, as with ants in the pants, the mites go up and the tights (tites) come down..The most common stalagmites are speleothems, which usually form in limestone caves.[5] Stalagmite formation occurs only under certain pH conditions within the cavern.They form through deposition of calcium carbonate and other minerals, which is precipitated from mineralized water solutions.Limestone is the chief form of calcium carbonate rock,  which is dissolved by water that contains carbon dioxide, forming a calcium bicarbonate solution in caverns.[6] The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the water must be greater than the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the cave chamber for conventional stalagmite growth.[7].If stalactites \u2013 the ceiling formations \u2013 grow long enough to connect with stalagmites on the floor, they form a column..Stalagmites should normally not be touched, since the rock buildup is formed by minerals precipitating out of the water solution onto the existing surface; skin oils can alter the surface tension where the mineral water clings or flows, thus affecting the growth of the formation.Oils and dirt (mud, clay) from human contact can also stain the formation and change its color permanently..Another type of stalagmite is formed in lava tubes while molten and

known as the white shark, white pointer, or simply great white, is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans.It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon.The great white shark is notable for its size, with the largest preserved female specimen measuring 5.83m (19.1ft) in length and around 2,000kg (4,410lb) in weight at maturity.[3] However, most are smaller; males measure 3.4 to 4.0m (11 to 13ft), and females measure 4.6 to 4.9m (15 to 16ft) on average.[4][5] According to a 2014 study, the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above previous estimates,[6] making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fishes currently known.[7] According to the same study, male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring.[8] Great white sharks can swim at speeds of 25km/h (16mph)[9] for short bursts and to depths of 1,200m (3,900ft).[10].The great white shark is arguably the world's largest-known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals, such as pinnipeds and dolphins.The great white shark is also known to prey upon a variety of other animals, including fish, other sharks, and seabirds.It has only one recorded natural predator, the orca.[11].The species faces numerous ecological challenges which has resulted in international protection.The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the great white shark as a vulnerable species,[1] and it is included in Appendix II of CITES.[12] It is also protected by several national governments, such as Australia (as of 2018).[13] Due to their need to travel long distances for seasonal migration and extremely demanding diet, it is not logistically feasible to keep great white sharks in captivity; because of this, while attempts have been made to do so in the past, there are no known aquariums in the world believed to house a live specimen.[14].The great white shark is depicted in popular culture as a ferocious man-eater, largely as a result of the novel Jaws by Peter Benchley and its subsequent film adaptation by Steven Spielberg.Humans are not a preferred prey,[15]  but nevertheless it is responsible for the largest number of reported and identified fatal unprovoked shark attacks on humans.[16] However, attacks are rare, typically occurring fewer than 10 times per year globally.[17][18].The great white is the sole recognized extant species in the genus Carcharodon, and is one of five extant species belonging to the family Lamnidae.[19] Other members of this family include the mako sharks, porbeagle, and salmon shark.The family belongs to the

party.Special celebrations and gifts are often given for particular anniversary milestones (e.g., 10, 15, 20, or 25 years).In some cultures, traditional names exist for milestone anniversaries; for instance, fifty years of marriage may be known variously as a \"golden wedding anniversary\", \"golden anniversary\" or \"golden wedding\"..Associating a wedding anniversary with precious metals such  as \"gold\" (50 years) or \"silver\" (25 years) has been documented in Germanic countries since the 1500s.[1] In English-speaking countries, the tradition of associating gift-giving with wedding anniversaries became more prevalent in the nineteenth century.[2]  In the twentieth century, increased commercialization led to the inclusion of more anniversaries to a list of predetermined gifts.[3][4].In some parts of the world, couples can receive special recognition from government officials for particular milestones.In the Commonwealth realms, a couple can receive a message from the monarch for 60th, 65th and 70th wedding anniversaries and for any wedding anniversary after that.This is done by applying to Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom or to the governor-general's office

scanning on the flatbed or platen (the \"glass\") or through a document feeder.The vast majority of fax machines have an ADF, allowing the unattended sending of multi-page faxes.ADF is so ubiquitous

early European modern humans appear in the fossil record about 48,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic Era.Settled agriculture marked the Neolithic Era, which spread slowly across Europe from southeast to the north and west.The later Neolithic period saw the introduction of early metallurgy and the use of copper-based tools and weapons, and the building of megalithic structures, as exemplified by Stonehenge.During the Indo-European migrations, Europe saw migrations from the east and southeast.The period known as classical antiquity began with the emergence of the city-states of ancient Greece.Later, the Roman Empire came to dominate the entire Mediterranean basin.The Migration Period of the Germanic people began in the late 4th century AD and made gradual incursions into various parts of the Roman Empire..The Fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476 traditionally marks the start of the Middle Ages.While the Eastern Roman Empire would continue for another 1000 years, the former lands of the Western Empire would be fragmented into a number of different states.At the same time, the early Slavs began to become established as a distinct group in the central and

producer Katsuya Eguchi stated that the device was designed to filter out video game sound from the audio speakers.[2] Miyamoto noted at the time that the quality of the noise filtering functionality in the Wii Speak is \"very good\", which may have contributed to the cost of the device.[3] An on/off switch was originally planned, but the microphone was ultimately designed to only turn on when a

crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader.Heavily influenced by Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, Kafka even went so far as to call Dostoevsky a blood relative.[2] Like Kafka's two other novels, The Castle and Amerika, The Trial was never completed, although it does include a chapter which appears to bring the story to an intentionally abrupt ending..After Kafka's death in 1924 his friend and literary executor Max Brod edited the text for publication by Verlag Die Schmiede.The original manuscript is held at the Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach am Neckar, Germany.The first English-language translation, by Willa and Edwin Muir, was published in 1937.[3] In 1999, the book was listed in Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century and as No.2 of the Best German Novels of the Twentieth Century..Kafka drafted the opening sentence of The Trial in August 1914, and continued work on the novel throughout 1915.This was an unusually productive period for Kafka, despite the outbreak of World War I, which significantly increased the pressures of his day job as an insurance agent.[4].Having begun by writing the opening and concluding sections of the novel, Kafka worked on the intervening scenes in a haphazard manner, using several different notebooks simultaneously.His friend Max Brod, knowing Kafka's habit of destroying his own work, eventually took the manuscript into safekeeping.This manuscript consisted of 161 loose pages torn from notebooks, which Kafka had bundled together into chapters.The order of the chapters was not made clear to

Jews across German-occupied Europe, around two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population.The murders were carried out primarily through mass shootings and poison gas in extermination camps, chiefly Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, and Che\u0142mno in occupied Poland..The Nazis developed their ideology based on racism and pursuit of \"living space\", and seized power in early 1933.In an attempt to force all German Jews to emigrate, the regime passed anti-Jewish laws and orchestrated a nationwide pogrom in November 1938.After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, occupation authorities began to establish ghettos to segregate Jews.Following the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, 1.5 to 2million Jews were shot by German forces and local collaborators..Later in 1941 or early 1942, the highest levels of the German government decided to murder all Jews in Europe.Victims were deported by rail to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, most were killed with poison gas.Other Jews continued to be employed in forced labor camps where many died from starvation, abuse or exhaustion[2] or used as test subjects in deadly medical experiments.[3] Although many Jews tried to escape, surviving in hiding was difficult due to factors such as the lack of money to pay helpers and the risk of denunciation.The property, homes, and jobs belonging to murdered Jews were redistributed to the German occupiers and other non-Jews.Although the majority of Holocaust victims died in 1942, the killing continued at a lower rate

the Millennial Generation, is the demographic cohort following Generation X .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Millennials, also known as Generation Y (often shortened to Gen Y), are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z.Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with the generation typically being defined as people born from 1981 to 1996.[1]  Most millennials are the children of baby boomers and older Generation X.[2] In turn millennials are often the parents of Generation Alpha.[3].As the first generation to grow up with the Internet, Millennials have also been described as the first global generation.[4] The generation is generally marked by elevated usage of and familiarity with the Internet, mobile devices, and social media.[5] The term \"digital natives\", which is now also applied to successive generations, was originally coined to describe this generation.[6].Millennials have also been called the \"Unluckiest Generation\" because the average millennial has experienced slower economic growth since entering the workforce than any other generation in U.S.history.[7] The generation has also been weighed down by student debt and child-care costs.[8].Across the globe, young people have postponed marriage or living together as a couple.[9] Millennials were born at a time of declining fertility rates around the world,[10] and are having fewer children than their predecessors.[11][12][13][14] Those in developing nations will continue to constitute the bulk of global population growth.[15] In the developed world, young people of the 2010s were less inclined to have sexual intercourse compared to their predecessors when they were at the same age.[16] In the West, they are less likely to be religious than their predecessors, but they may identify as spiritual.[17][10].Between the 1990s and the 2010s, people from the developing world became increasingly well educated, a factor that boosted economic growth in these countries.[18] Millennials across the world have suffered significant economic disruption since starting their working lives; many faced high levels of youth unemployment during their early years in the job market in the wake of the Great Recession, and suffered another recession in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[19][20].Members of this demographic cohort are known as millennials because the oldest became adults around the turn of the millennium.[21] Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, known for creating the Strauss\u2013Howe generational theory, are widely credited with naming the millennials.[22] They coined the term in 1987, around the time children born in 1982 were entering kindergarten, and the media were first identifying their prospective link to the impending new millennium as the high school graduating class of 2000.[23] They wrote about the cohort in their books Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 (1991)[24] and Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation (2000).[23].In August 1993, an Advertising Age editorial coined the phrase Generation Y to describe teenagers of the day, then aged 13\u201319 (born 1974\u20131980), who were at the time defined as different from Generation X.[25] However, the 1974\u20131980 cohort was later re-identified by most media sources as the last wave of Generation X,[26] and by 2003 Ad Age had moved their Generation Y starting year up to 1982.[27] According to journalist Bruce Horovitz, in 2012, Ad Age \"threw in the towel by conceding that millennials is a better name than Gen Y,\"[22] and by 2014, a past director of data strategy at Ad Age said to NPR \"the Generation Y label was a placeholder until we found out more about them.\"[28].Millennials are sometimes called echo boomers, due to them often being the offspring of the baby boomers, the significant increase in birth rates from the early 1980s to mid-1990s, and their generation's large size relative to that of boomers.[29][30][31][32] In the United States, the echo boom's birth rates peaked in August 1990[33][29] and a twentieth-century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued.[34][35] Psychologist Jean Twenge described millennials as \"Generation Me\" in her 2006 book Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled \u2013 and More Miserable Than Ever Before,[36][37] while in 2013, Time magazine ran a cover story titled Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation.[38] Alternative names for this group proposed include the Net Generation,[39] Generation 9/11,[40] Generation Next,[41] and The Burnout Generation.[42].Oxford Living Dictionaries describes a millennial as a person \"born between the early 1980s and the late 1990s.\"[43] Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines millennial as \"a person born in the 1980s or 1990s\".[44] More detailed definitions in use are as follows:.Jonathan Rauch, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote for The Economist in 2018 that \"generations are squishy concepts\", but the 1981 to 1996 birth cohort is a \"widely accepted\" definition for millennials.[1] Reuters also state that the \"widely accepted definition\" is 1981\u20131996.[45].\nQ: What Generation Am I\nReasoning: Generation Y,

(/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0d\u0251\u02d0/) or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century, with early centres in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, at the Cabaret Voltaire (in 1916), founded by Hugo Ball with his companion Emmy Hennings, and in Berlin in 1917.[2][3] New York Dada began c.\u20091915,[4][5] and after 1920 Dada flourished in Paris.Dadaist activities lasted until the mid 1920s..Developed in reaction to World War I, the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected the logic, reason, and aestheticism of modern capitalist society, instead expressing nonsense, irrationality, and anti-bourgeois protest in their works.[6][7][8] The art of the movement began primarily as performance[9] art, but eventually spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including collage, sound poetry, cut-up writing, and sculpture.Dadaist artists expressed their discontent toward violence, war, and nationalism and maintained political affinities with radical politics on the left-wing and far-left politics.[10][11][12][13].There is no consensus on the origin of the movement's name; a common story is that the German artist Richard Huelsenbeck slid a paper knife (letter-opener) at random into a dictionary, where it landed on \"dada\", a colloquial French term for a hobby horse.Jean Arp wrote that Tristan Tzara invented the word at 6p.m.on 6February 1916, in the Caf\u00e9 de la Terrasse in Z\u00fcrich.[14] Others note that it suggests the first words of a child, evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group.Still others speculate that the word might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning (or no meaning at all) in any language, reflecting the movement's internationalism.[15].The roots of Dada lie in pre-war avant-garde.The term anti-art, a precursor to Dada, was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 to characterize works that challenge accepted definitions of art.[16] Cubism and the development of collage and abstract art would inform the movement's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention.The work of French poets, Italian Futurists and the German Expressionists would influence Dada's rejection of the tight correlation between words and meaning.[17] Works such as Ubu Roi (1896) by Alfred Jarry and the ballet Parade (1916\u201317) by Erik Satie would also be characterized as proto-Dadaist works.[18] The Dada movement's principles were first collected in Hugo Ball's Dada Manifesto in 1916.Ball is seen as the founder of the Dada movement.[19].\nQ: what did dada artists

fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons.[1] The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture).The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors..Silk is produced by several insects; but, generally, only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing.There has been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level.[2] Silk is mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, but some insects, such as webspinners and raspy crickets, produce silk throughout their lives.[3] Silk production also occurs in hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), silverfish, caddisflies, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles, lacewings, fleas, flies, and midges.[2] Other types of arthropods produce silk, most notably various arachnids, such as spiders..The word silk comes from Old English: sioloc, from Latin: sericum[4] and Ancient Greek: \u03c3\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, romanized:s\u0113rik\u00f3s, \"silken\", ultimately from the Chinese word \"s\u012b\" and other Asian sources\u2014compare Mandarin s\u012b \"silk\", Manchurian sirghe, Mongolian sirkek.[5].The production of silk originated in China in the Neolithic period, although it would eventually reach other places of the world (Yangshao culture, 4th millennium BC).Silk production remained confined to China until the Silk Road opened at some point during the latter part of the 1st millennium BC, though China maintained its virtual monopoly over silk production for another thousand years..Several kinds of wild silk, produced by caterpillars other than the mulberry silkworm, have been known and spun in China, South Asia, and Europe since ancient times, e.g.the production of Eri silk in Assam, India.However, the scale of production was always far smaller than for cultivated silks.There are several reasons for this: first, they differ from the domesticated varieties in colour and texture and are therefore less uniform; second, cocoons gathered in the wild have usually had the pupa emerge from them before being discovered so the silk thread that makes up the cocoon has been torn into shorter lengths; and third, many wild cocoons are covered in a mineral layer that prevents attempts to reel from them long strands of silk.[6] Thus, the only way to obtain silk suitable for spinning into textiles in areas where commercial silks are not cultivated was by tedious and labor-intensive carding..\nQ: what can silk be used

first distinctly recognised breeds of Asian cat.Derived from the Wichianmat landrace, one of several varieties of cats native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the original Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century.[1] The carefully refined, more extreme-featured, modern-style Siamese is characterised by blue almond-shaped eyes; a triangular head shape; large ears; an elongated, slender, and muscular body; and various forms of point colouration.Other than colouration, the modern-style Siamese bears little resemblance to the original stock, and the more moderate, traditional, or \"old-style\" Siamese, with a much rounder head and body, has been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat.The International Cat Association describes the modern Siamese as affectionate, social, intelligent, and playful into adulthood, often enjoying a game of fetch.[2] Siamese tend to seek human interaction and also like companionship from other cats..The Siamese (sometimes in the traditional form) is among the foundation stock of several other breeds developed by crossbreeding with other cats; some examples are the Oriental Shorthair and Colorpoint Shorthair, developed to expand the range of coat patterns; the long-haired variant most often dubbed the Himalayan; and hair-mutation breeds, including the Cornish Rex, Sphynx, Peterbald, and blue-point Siamese cat.The Siamese cat comes in two distinct variations: traditional, with a rounded head (though not as rounded as the later American Apple-head mix) and a slightly chubby body; or the modern Siamese, which is very skinny and has a wedge-shaped head.The long-haired Siamese is recognised internationally as a Balinese cat.Siamese cats are one of the more common breeds to have non-white irises..A description and depiction of the Wichienmaat (Siamese cat) first appears in a collection of ancient manuscripts called the Tamra Maew (The Cat-Book Poems), thought to originate from the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1351 to 1767 AD).Over a dozen are now kept in the National Library of Thailand, while others have resurfaced outside of Thailand and are now in the British Library and National Library of Australia.In addition to the old Siamese cat, the Tamra Maew also describes other heritage cats of Thailand including the Korat cat (Malet), which is still bred for preservation in Thailand today and has become popular in other countries, and the Konja cat (Black cat), Suphalak (a controversy in Burmese cat)..When the capital city Ayutthaya was sacked on 7

several ways to define \"money\", but standard measures usually include currency in circulation (i.e.physical cash) and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions).[1][2] Money supply data is recorded and published, usually by the national statistical agency or the central bank of the country.Empirical money supply measures are usually named M1, M2, M3, etc., according to how wide a definition of money they embrace.The precise definitions vary from country to country, in part depending on national financial institutional traditions..Even for narrow aggregates like M1, by far the largest part of the money supply consists of deposits in commercial banks, whereas currency (banknotes and coins) issued by central banks only makes up a small part of the total money supply in modern economies.The public's demand for currency and bank deposits and commercial banks' supply of loans are consequently important determinants of money supply changes.As these decisions are influenced by central banks' monetary policy, not least their setting of interest rates, the money supply is ultimately determined by complex interactions between non-banks, commercial banks and central banks..According to the quantity theory supported by the monetarist school of thought, there is a tight causal connection between growth in the money supply and inflation.In particular during the 1970s and 1980s this idea was influential, and several major central banks during that period attempted to control the money supply closely, following a monetary policy target of increasing the money supply stably.However, the strategy was generally found to be impractical because money demand turned out to be too unstable for the strategy to work as intended..Consequently, the money supply has lost its central role in monetary policy, and central banks today generally do not try to control the money supply.\nQ: what affects the money

political scientist and constitutional scholar David Fellman:.Constitutionalism is descriptive of a complicated concept, deeply embedded in historical experience, which subjects the officials who exercise governmental powers to the limitations of a higher law.Constitutionalism proclaims the desirability of the rule of law as opposed to rule by the arbitrary judgment or mere fiat of public officials...Throughout the literature dealing with modern public law and the foundations of statecraft the central element of the concept of constitutionalism is that in political society government officials are not free to do anything they please in any manner they choose; they are bound to observe both the limitations on power and the procedures which are set out in the supreme, constitutional law of the community.It may therefore be said that the touchstone of constitutionalism is the concept of limited government under a higher law.[3].Constitutionalism has prescriptive and descriptive uses.Law professor Gerhard Casper captured this aspect of the term in noting, \"Constitutionalism has both descriptive and prescriptive connotations.Used descriptively, it refers chiefly to the historical struggle for constitutional recognition of the people's right to 'consent' and certain other rights, freedoms, and privileges.Used prescriptively, its meaning incorporates those features of

associated with consumption (particularly quick consumption) of cold beverages or foods such as ice cream, popsicles, and snow cones.It is caused by a cold substance touching the roof of the mouth, and is believed to result from a nerve response causing rapid constriction and swelling of blood vessels,[3] \"referring\" pain from the roof of the mouth to the head.[4][5] The rate of intake for cold foods has been studied as a contributing factor.[1][6] It can also occur during a sudden exposure of unprotected head to cold temperatures, such as by diving into cold water.[7] A cold-stimulus headache is distinct from dentin hypersensitivity, a type of dental pain that can occur under similar circumstances..Cats and other animals have been observed exhibiting a similar reaction when presented with a similar stimulus.[8].The term ice-cream headache has been in use since at least January 31, 1937, contained in a journal entry by Rebecca Timbres published in the 1939 book We Didn't Ask Utopia: A Quaker Family in Soviet Russia.[9][non-primary source needed] The first published use of the term brain freeze, in the sense of a cold-stimulus headache, was in 1991.[10][non-primary source needed][a] 7-Eleven has trademarked the term.[11].A cold-stimulus headache is thought to be the direct result of the rapid cooling and rewarming of the capillaries in the sinuses leading to periods of vasoconstriction and vasodilation.A similar, but painless, blood vessel response causes the face to appear \"flushed\" after being outside on a cold day.In both instances, the low temperature causes the capillaries in the sinuses to constrict and then experience extreme rebound dilation as they warm up again.[12].In the palate, this dilation is sensed by nearby pain receptors, which then send signals back to the brain via the trigeminal nerve, one of the major nerves of the facial area.This nerve also senses facial pain, so as the neural signals are conducted the brain interprets the pain as coming from the forehead\u2014the same \"referred pain\" phenomenon seen in heart attacks.Brain-freeze pain may last from a few seconds to a few minutes.Research suggests that the same vascular mechanism and nerve implicated in \"brain freeze\" cause the aura (sensory disturbance) and pulsatile (throbbing pain) phases of migraines.[13].It is possible to have a cold-stimulus headache in both hot and cold weather, because the effect relies upon the temperature of the food being consumed rather than that of the environment.\nQ: What Causes Brain Freeze\nReasoning: An

extension, it is also often heard at funerals, graduations, and as a farewell or ending to other occasions; for instance, many branches of the Scouting movement use it to close jamborees and other functions.[2][3].The text is a Scots-language poem written  by Robert Burns in 1788[4][5] but based on an older Scottish folk song.In 1799, it was set to a traditional tune, which has since become standard.\"Auld Lang Syne\" is listed as numbers 6294 and 13892 in the Roud Folk Song Index..The poem's Scots title may be translated into standard English as \"old long since\" or, less literally, \"long long ago\",[6] \"days gone by\", \"times long past\" or \"old times\".Consequently, \"For auld lang syne\", as it appears in the first line of the chorus, might be loosely translated as \"for the sake of old times\"..The phrase \"Auld Lang Syne\" is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton (1570\u20131638), Allan Ramsay (1686\u20131757), and James Watson (1711), as well as older folk songs predating Burns.[7].In modern times, Matthew Fitt uses the phrase \"in the days of auld lang syne\" as the equivalent of \"once upon a time\" in his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language.[8].Robert Burns sent a copy of the original song to the Scots Musical Museum in 1788 with the remark, \"The following song, an old song, of the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in manuscript until I took it down from an old man.\"[9].Some of the lyrics were indeed \"collected\" rather than composed by the poet; the ballad \"Old Long Syne\" printed in 1711 by James Watson shows considerable similarity in the first verse and the chorus to Burns's later poem,[7] and is almost certainly derived from the same \"old song\"..\nQ: what does auld lang syne

cry.The video capturing the character's behavior became an Internet meme.As a result of positive reception to the meme, Blizzard subsequently added Leeroy Jenkins into World of Warcraft as an official non-player character and as a minion card and later as a hero in the online card game Hearthstone..The original video, titled Leeroy!!, was released by the World of Warcraft player guild \"Pals for Life\"[1] to video-sharing site Warcraftmovies on May 11, 2005.[2] The video features a group of players discussing a detailed battle plan for their next encounter while Leeroy is away from his computer, preparing a plate of chicken.This plan is intended to help Leeroy obtain a piece of armor from the boss monsters, but is ruined when Leeroy himself returns and, ignorant of the strategy, utters \"Let's do this!\" then immediately rushes headlong into battle shouting his own name in a stylized battle cry.After his companions sit silent for a moment in disbelief, they try to save him, but the chaotic nature of the fight leads into everyone being killed by the boss monsters.The guild chastises Leeroy for rushing into the fight without any planning, to which he retorts, \"At least I have chicken!\".The Internet meme started with the release of the video clip called A Rough Go[3] to the World of Warcraft game forum in a thread titled \"UBRS (vid) Rookery Overpowered! blue plz.\", which presented the video in a serious context.[4] The thread requested that other players provide help with strategy and that Blizzard reduce the difficulty of the encounter.The video spread as an

Alain Locke.The movement also included the new African American cultural expressions across the urban areas in the Northeast and Midwest United States affected by a renewed militancy in the general struggle for civil rights, combined with the Great Migration of African American workers fleeing the racist conditions of the Jim Crow Deep South,[1] as Harlem was the final destination of the largest number of those who migrated north..Though it was centered in the Harlem neighborhood, many francophone black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the movement,[2][3][4][5] which spanned from about 1918 until the mid-1930s.[6] Many of its ideas lived on much longer.The zenith of this \"flowering of Negro literature\", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, took place between 1924\u2014when Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance\u2014and 1929, the year of the stock-market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression.The Harlem Renaissance is considered to have been a rebirth of the African American arts.[7].Until the end of the Civil War, the majority of African Americans had been enslaved and lived in the South.During the Reconstruction Era, the emancipated African Americans began to strive for civic participation, political equality, and economic and cultural self-determination.Soon after the end of the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 gave rise to speeches by African American Congressmen addressing this Bill.[8] By 1875, sixteen African Americans had been elected and served in Congress and gave numerous speeches with their newfound civil empowerment.[9].The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 was followed by the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, part of Reconstruction legislation by Republicans.During the mid-to-late 1870s, racist whites organized in the Democratic Party launched a murderous campaign of racist terrorism to regain political power throughout the South.From 1890 to 1908, they proceeded to pass legislation that disenfranchised most African Americans and

East Africa, and continues unbroken into the present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.[1] The earliest known recorded history arose in Ancient Egypt,[2] and later in Nubia, the Sahel, the Maghreb, and the Horn of Africa.[3].Following the desertification of the Sahara, North African history became entwined with the Middle East and Southern Europe while the Bantu expansion swept from modern day Cameroon (Central West Africa) across much of the sub-Saharan continent in waves between around 1000 BC and 1 AD, creating a linguistic commonality across much of the central and Southern continent.[4].During the Middle Ages, Islam spread west from Arabia to Egypt, crossing the Maghreb and the Sahel.Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the Ajuran Empire, Bachwezi Empire, D'mt, Adal Sultanate, Alodia, Dagbon Kingdom, Warsangali Sultanate, Buganda Kingdom, Kingdom of Nri, Nok civilization, Mali Empire, Bono State, Songhai Empire,

colonialism, it is estimated that Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs.[5][6].From the late 15th century, Europeans joined the slave trade.[7] That includes the triangular trade, with the Portuguese initially acquiring slaves through trade and later by force as part of the Atlantic slave trade.They transported enslaved West, Central, and Southern Africans overseas.[8] Subsequently, European colonization of Africa developed rapidly from around 10% (1870) to over 90% (1914) in the Scramble for Africa (1881\u20131914)..However following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the Second World War (1939\u20131945), decolonization took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 Year of Africa.[9].Disciplines such as recording of oral history, historical linguistics, archaeology, and genetics have been vital in rediscovering the great African civilizations of antiquity..The first known hominids evolved in Africa.According to paleontology, the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the gorilla and the chimpanzee, great apes that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a bipedal locomotion which freed their hands.This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and

having occurred only 344 times, starting with Curry Foley in 1882.[2][3] The most recent cycle in MLB was accomplished by Jos\u00e9 Altuve of the Houston Astros on August 28, 2023..The cycle is about as uncommon as a no-hitter;[4][5] it has been called \"one of the rarest\"[6] and \"most difficult feats\"[7] in baseball.Based on 2009 offensive levels, the probability of an average MLB player hitting for a cycle against an average team in a game is about 0.0059%; this corresponds to about 21\u20442 cycles in a 162-game season with 30 teams.[8] The most cycles hit in a single major league season is eight, which occurred in both 1933 and 2009.[3].In other baseball leagues, the cycle is achieved less frequently.Through June 2022, there have been 76 cycles hit in Nippon Professional

6,386 doubles, 840 triples, or 3,180 home runs.[16] The MLB leader in singles is Pete Rose, who is also the league's all-time hit leader.[17] The single-season leader in singles is Ichiro Suzuki, who broke Willie Keeler's 106-year-old record in 2004 by notching 225, 19 more than the previous record.[18] None of the top five players in singles (Rose, Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, Cap Anson, and Keeler)

century) began, many of the pre-existing local African slave systems began supplying captives for slave markets outside Africa.[2][3] Slavery in contemporary Africa is still practiced despite it being illegal..In the relevant literature African slavery is categorized into indigenous slavery and export slavery, depending on whether or not slaves were traded beyond the continent.[4].Slavery in historical Africa was practised in many different forms: Debt slavery, enslavement of war captives, military slavery, slavery for prostitution, and enslavement of criminals were all practised in various parts of Africa.[5] Slavery for domestic and court purposes was widespread throughout Africa.Plantation slavery also occurred, primarily on the eastern coast of Africa and in parts of West Africa.The importance of domestic plantation slavery increased during the 19th century, due to the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade.Many African states dependent on the international slave trade reoriented their economies towards legitimate commerce worked by slave labour.[6].Multiple forms of slavery and servitude have existed throughout African history, and were shaped by indigenous practices of slavery as well as the Roman institution of slavery (and the later Christian views on slavery), the Islamic institutions of slavery via the Muslim slave trade, and eventually the Atlantic slave trade.[2] Slavery was a part of the economic structure of African societies for many centuries, although the extent varied.[2] Ibn Battuta, who visited the ancient kingdom of Mali in the mid-14th century, recounts that the local inhabitants vied with each other in the number of slaves and servants they had, and was himself given a slave boy as a \"hospitality gift.\"[7] In sub-Saharan Africa, the slave relationships were often complex, with rights and freedoms given to individuals held in slavery and restrictions on sale and treatment by their masters.[8] Many communities had hierarchies between different types of slaves: for example, differentiating between those who had been born into slavery and those who had been captured through war.[9].\"The slaves in Africa, I suppose, are nearly in the proportion of three to one to the freemen.They claim no reward for their services except food and clothing, and are treated with kindness or severity, according to the good or bad disposition of their masters.Custom, however, has established certain rules with regard to the treatment of slaves, which it is thought dishonourable to violate.Thus the domestic slaves, or

eyes after briefly looking into a light source, such as a camera flash.Palinopsia is a common symptom of visual snow..Negative afterimages are primarily caused by neural adaptation of the cells that carry signals from the retina of the eye to the rest of the brain, the retinal ganglion cells.[3] There is also a small contribution when the eye's photoreceptors, the rods and cones, adapt to overstimulation and lose sensitivity.[4] There is brain contribution as well.[5].Normally, any image is moved over the retina by small eye movements known as microsaccades before much adaptation can occur.However, if the image is very intense and brief, or if the image is large, or if the eye remains very steady, these small movements cannot keep the image on unadapted parts of the

Millennials.Researchers and popular media use the mid-to-late 1960s as starting birth years and the late 1970s to early 1980s as ending birth years, with the generation being generally defined as people born from 1965 to 1980.[1] By this definition and U.S.Census data, there are 65.2 million Gen Xers[2] in the United States as of 2019.[3] Most members of Generation X are the children of the Silent Generation and early boomers;[4][5] Xers are also often the parents of millennials[4] and Generation Z.[6].As children in the 1970s and 1980s, a time of shifting societal values, Gen Xers were sometimes called the \"latchkey generation\", which stems from their returning as children to an empty home and needing to use the door key.This was a result of increasing divorce rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce prior to widespread availability of childcare options outside the home..As adolescents and young adults in the 1980s and 1990s, Xers were dubbed the \"MTV Generation\" (a reference to the music video channel), sometimes being characterized as slackers, cynical, and disaffected.Some of the many cultural influences on Gen X youth included a proliferation of musical genres with strong social-tribal identity such as punk, post-punk, and heavy metal, in addition to later forms developed by Gen Xers themselves (e.g., grunge, grindcore and related genres).Film, both the birth of franchise mega-sequels and a proliferation of independent film (enabled in part by video) was also a notable cultural influence.Video games both in amusement parlours and in devices in western homes were also a major part of juvenile entertainment for the first time.Politically, in many Eastern Bloc countries, Generation X experienced the last days of communism and transition to capitalism as part of its youth.In much of the western world, a similar time period was defined by a dominance of conservatism and free market economics..In midlife during the early 21st

over a bony prominence as a result of usually long-term pressure, or pressure in combination with shear or friction.The most common sites are the skin overlying the sacrum, coccyx, heels, and hips, though other sites can be affected, such as the elbows, knees, ankles, back of shoulders, or the back of the cranium..Pressure ulcers occur due to pressure applied to soft tissue resulting in completely or partially obstructed blood flow to the soft tissue.Shear is also a cause, as it can pull on blood vessels that feed the skin.Pressure ulcers most commonly develop in individuals who are not moving about, such as those who are on chronic bedrest or consistently use a wheelchair.It is widely believed that other factors can influence the tolerance of skin for pressure and shear, thereby increasing the risk of pressure ulcer development.These factors are protein-calorie malnutrition, microclimate (skin wetness caused by sweating or incontinence), diseases that reduce blood flow to the skin, such as arteriosclerosis, or diseases that reduce the sensation in the skin, such as paralysis or neuropathy.The healing of pressure ulcers may be slowed by the age of the person, medical conditions (such as arteriosclerosis, diabetes or infection), smoking or medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs..Although often prevented and treatable if detected early, pressure ulcers can be very difficult to prevent in critically ill people, frail elders, and individuals with impaired mobility such as wheelchair users (especially where spinal injury is involved).Primary prevention is to redistribute pressure by regularly turning the person.The benefit of turning to avoid further sores is well documented since at least the 19th century.[1] In addition to turning and re-positioning the person in the bed or wheelchair, eating a balanced diet with adequate protein[2] and keeping the skin free from exposure to urine and stool is important.[3].The rate of pressure ulcers in hospital settings is high; the prevalence in European hospitals ranges from 8.3% to 23%, and the prevalence was 26% in Canadian healthcare settings from 1990 to 2003.[4] In 2013, there were 29,000 documented

An airline hub or hub airport is an airport used by one or more airlines to concentrate passenger traffic and flight operations.Hubs serve as transfer (or stop-over) points to help get passengers to their final destination.[a][b] It is part of the hub-and-spoke system.An airline may operate flights from several non-hub (spoke) cities to the hub airport, and passengers traveling between spoke cities connect through the hub.This paradigm creates economies of scale that allow an airline to serve (via an intermediate connection) city-pairs that could otherwise not be economically served on a non-stop basis.This system contrasts with the point-to-point model, in which there are no hubs and nonstop flights are instead offered between spoke cities.Hub airports also serve origin and destination (O&D) traffic..The hub-and-spoke system allows an airline to serve fewer routes, so fewer aircraft are needed.[3] The system also increases passenger loads; a flight from a hub to a spoke carries not just passengers originating at the hub, but also passengers originating at multiple spoke cities.[4] However, the system is costly.Additional employees and facilities are needed to cater to connecting passengers.To serve spoke cities of varying populations and demand, an airline requires several aircraft types, and specific training and equipment are necessary for each type.[3] In addition, airlines may experience capacity constraints as they expand at their hub airports.[4][5].For the passenger, the hub-and-spoke system offers one-stop air service to a wide array of destinations.[3][6] However, it requires having to regularly make connections en route to their final destination, which increases travel time.[6] Additionally, airlines can come to monopolise their hubs (fortress hubs), allowing them to freely increase fares as passengers have no alternative.[4] High domestic connectivity in the United States is achieved through airport location and hub dominance.The top 10 megahubs in the US are dominated by American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, the three largest United States-based airlines.[7].Airlines may operate banks of

the rising naval power of Athens.[3] Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BC),[4] from which it emerged victorious after the Battle of Aegospotami.The decisive Battle of Leuctra against Thebes in 371BC ended the Spartan hegemony, although the city-state maintained its political independence until its forced integration into the Achaean League in 192

population to reach one billion and only 222 years more to reach 8billion.[3].The human population has experienced continuous growth following the Great Famine of 1315\u20131317 and the end of the Black Death in 1350, when it was nearly 370,000,000.[4] The highest global population growth rates, with increases of over 1.8% per year, occurred between 1955 and 1975, peaking at 2.1% between 1965

in the early 1800s and 800million to 1billion in the 1840s.[14].It is difficult for estimates to be better than rough approximations, as even current population estimates are fraught with uncertainties from 3% to 5%.[15].Estimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15million.[16][17] Even earlier, genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BC, according to the now largely discredited Toba catastrophe theory.By contrast,

personnel in most countries were not routinely issued with ID tags.As a result, if someone was killed in action and their body was not recovered until much later, there was often little or no chance of identifying the remains unless the person in question was carrying items that would identify them, or had marked their clothing or possessions with identifying information.Starting around the time of the First World War, nations began to issue their service personnel with purpose-made identification tags.These were usually made of some form of lightweight metal such as aluminium.However, in the case of the British Army the material chosen was compressed fiber, which was not very durable.Although wearing identification tags proved to be highly beneficial, the problem remained that bodies could be completely destroyed (ranging from total body disruption to outright disintegration), burned or buried by the type of high-explosive munitions routinely used in modern warfare or in destructions of vehicles..Additionally, the combat environment itself could increase the likelihood of missing combatants such as jungle warfare,[1][2] or submarine warfare,[3][4][5] or aircraft

pupils in color photographs of the eyes of humans and several other animals.It occurs when using a photographic flash that is very close to the camera lens (as with most compact cameras) in ambient low light..In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close, so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil, reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil.The camera records this reflected light.The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is behind the retina.[1] The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid, and plays virtually no role.The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region, and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect.[2] The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light, below 430nm (depending on age), and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500nm, but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea.Melanin, located in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choroid, shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths.But blood is the main determinant of the red color, because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600nm.The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina.This amount varies strongly between individuals.Light-skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red-eye effect than dark-skinned people with brown eyes..The same holds for animals.\nQ: what causes photo red eye\nReasoning: Intense red-eye

related genera (e.g., Calyptapis) are known from fossils.They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are also found in South America, where a few lowland tropical species have been identified.European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania.Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals..Most bumblebees are social insects that form colonies with a single queen.The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest.Cuckoo bumblebees are brood parasitic and do not make nests or form colonies; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers.Cuckoo bumblebees were previously classified as a separate genus, but are now usually treated as members of Bombus..Bumblebees have round bodies covered in soft hair (long branched setae) called 'pile', making them appear and feel fuzzy.They have aposematic (warning) coloration, often consisting of contrasting bands of colour, and different species of

observer.To \"carry\" in this context indicates that the firearm is kept readily accessible on the person, within a holster or attached to a sling.Carrying a firearm directly in the hands, particularly in a firing position or combat stance, is known as \"brandishing\" and may constitute a serious crime, but is not the mode of \"carrying\" discussed in this article..The practice of open carry, where gun owners openly carry firearms while they go about their daily business, has seen an increase in the United States in recent years,[1][2] and is a hotly debated topic in gun politics.This has been marked by a number of organized events intended to increase the visibility of open carry and public awareness about the practice.[3] Proponents of open carry point to history and statistics, noting that criminals usually conceal their weapons, in contrast to the law-abiding citizens who display their weapons.[4] As of 2022, almost all US states allow for open carry either without a permit or with a permit/license..The gun rights community has become supportive of the practice, while gun control groups are generally opposed.[5][6][7].Today in the United States, the laws

six armed forces of the United States.The AAF was a component of the United States Army, which on 2 March 1942[1] was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces: the Army Ground Forces, the United States Army Services of Supply (which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces), and the Army Air Forces.Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff..The AAF administered all parts of military aviation formerly distributed among the Air Corps, General Headquarters Air Force, and the ground forces' corps area commanders and thus became the first air organization of the U.S.Army to control its own installations and support personnel.The peak size of the AAF during World War II was over 2.4million men and women in service and nearly 80,000 aircraft by 1944, and 783 domestic bases in December 1943.[3] By \"V-E Day\", the Army Air Forces had 1.25million men stationed overseas and operated from more than 1,600 airfields worldwide.[4].The Army Air Forces was created in June 1941 to provide the air arm greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently, to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force, and to end an increasingly divisive administrative battle within the Army over control of aviation doctrine and organization that had been ongoing since the creation of an aviation section within the U.S.Army Signal Corps in 1914.The AAF succeeded both the Air Corps, which had been the statutory military aviation branch since 1926 and the GHQ Air Force, which had been activated in 1935 to quiet the demands of airmen for an independent Air Force similar to the Royal Air Force which had already been established in the United Kingdom..Although other nations already had separate air forces independent of their army or navy (such as the Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe), the AAF remained a part of the Army until a defense reorganization in the post-war period resulted in the passage by the United States Congress of the National Security Act of 1947 with the creation of an independent United States Air Force in September 1947..In its

symptoms are dyspnea (breathlessness) and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs).", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Cardiomyopathy is a group of primary diseases of the heart muscle.[1] Early on there may be few or no symptoms.[1] As the disease worsens, shortness of breath, feeling tired, and swelling of the legs may occur, due to the onset of heart failure.[1] An irregular heart beat and fainting may occur.[1] Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.[2].As of 2013, cardiomyopathies are defined as \u201cdisorders characterized by morphologically and functionally abnormal myocardium in the absence of any other disease that is sufficient, by itself, to cause the observed phenotype.\u201d[8][9] Types of cardiomyopathy include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome).[3] In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the heart muscle enlarges and thickens.[3] In dilated cardiomyopathy the ventricles enlarge and weaken.[3] In restrictive cardiomyopathy the ventricle stiffens.[3].In many cases, the cause cannot be determined.[4] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually inherited, whereas dilated cardiomyopathy is inherited in about one third of cases.[4] Dilated cardiomyopathy may also result from alcohol, heavy metals, coronary artery disease, cocaine use, and viral infections.[4] Restrictive cardiomyopathy may be caused by amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and some cancer treatments.[4] Broken heart syndrome is caused by extreme emotional or physical stress.[3].Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and the severity of symptoms.[5] Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery.[5] Surgery may include a ventricular assist device or heart transplant.[5] In 2015 cardiomyopathy and myocarditis affected 2.5 million people.[6] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affects about 1 in 500 people while dilated cardiomyopathy affects 1 in 2,500.[3][10] They resulted in 354,000 deaths up from 294,000 in 1990.[7][11] Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is more common in young people.[2].Signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy include:.Cardiomyopathies can be of genetic (familial) or non-genetic (acquired) origin.[12] Genetic cardiomyopathies usually are caused by sarcomere or cytoskeletal diseases, neuromuscular disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, malformation syndromes and sometimes are unidentified.[13][14] Non-genetic cardiomyopathies can have a definitive causes such as viral infections, myocarditis and others.[15][16].Cardiomyopathies are either confined to the heart or are part of a generalized systemic disorder, both often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability.Other diseases that cause heart muscle dysfunction are excluded, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, or abnormalities of the heart valves.[17] Often, the underlying cause remains unknown, but in many cases the cause may be identifiable.[18] Alcoholism, for example, has been identified as a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, as has drug toxicity, and certain infections (including Hepatitis C).[19][20][21] Untreated celiac disease can cause cardiomyopathies, which can completely reverse with a timely diagnosis.[22] In addition to acquired causes, molecular biology and genetics have given rise to the recognition of various genetic causes.[20][23].A more clinical categorization of cardiomyopathy as 'hypertrophied', 'dilated', or 'restrictive',[24] has become difficult to maintain because some of the conditions could fulfill more than one of those three categories at any particular stage of their development.[25].The current American Heart Association (AHA) definition divides cardiomyopathies into primary, which affect the heart alone, and secondary, which are the result of illness affecting other parts of the body.These categories are further broken down into subgroups which incorporate new genetic and molecular biology knowledge.[26].The pathophysiology of cardiomyopathies is better understood at the cellular level

"what does shut the fuck up mean in spanish?", "document_title": "Fuck", "answer": "Fuck in its literal meaning refers to the act of sexual intercourse .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Fuck is an English-language profanity which often refers to the act of sexual intercourse, but is also commonly used as an intensifier or to convey disdain.While its origin is obscure, it is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475CE.[1] In modern usage, the term fuck and its derivatives (such as fucker and fucking) are used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, an interjection or an adverb.There are many common phrases that employ the word as well as compounds that incorporate it, such as motherfucker, fuckwit, fuckup, fucknut, fucktard, and fuck off..It is unclear whether the word has always been considered a pejorative or, if not, when it first came to be used to describe (often in an extremely angry, hostile or belligerent manner) unpleasant circumstances or people in an intentionally offensive way, such as in the term motherfucker, one of its more common usages in some parts of the English-speaking world.Some English-speaking countries censor it on television and radio.Andrea Millwood Hargrave's 2000 study of the attitudes of the British public found that fuck was considered the third-most-severe profanity, and its derivative motherfucker second.Cunt was considered the most severe.[2].Nevertheless, the word has increasingly become less of a pejorative and more publicly acceptable, an example of the \"dysphemism treadmill\" or semantic drift known as melioration, wherein former pejoratives become inoffensive and commonplace.[3][4] Because of its increasing usage in the public forum, in 2005 the word was included for the first time as one of three vulgarities in The Canadian Press's Canadian Press Caps and Spelling guide.Journalists were advised to refrain from censoring the word but use it sparingly and only when its inclusion was essential to the story.[5] According to linguist Pamela Hobbs, \"notwithstanding its increasing public use, enduring cultural models that inform our beliefs about the nature of sexuality and sexual acts preserve its status as a vile utterance that continues to inspire moral outrage.\" Hobbs considers users rather than usage of the word and sub-divides users into \"non-users\", for whom \"the word belongs to a set of taboo words, the very utterance of which constitutes an affront, and any use of the word, regardless of its form (verb, adjective, adverb, etc.) or meaning (literal or metaphorical) evokes the core sexual meanings and associated sexual imagery that motivate the taboo.\"; and \"users\", for whom \"metaphorical uses of the word fuck no more evoke images of sexual intercourse than a ten-year-old's 'My mom'll kill me if she finds out' evokes images of murder,\" so that the \"criteria of taboo are missing.\"[6].The Oxford English Dictionary states that the ultimate etymology is uncertain, but that the word is \"probably cognate\" with a number of Germanic words with meanings involving striking, rubbing and having sex or is derivative of the Old French word that meant 'to have sex'.[7].The word has probable cognates in other Germanic languages, such as German ficken ('to fuck'); Dutch fokken ('to breed', 'to beget'); Afrikaans fok ('to fuck');[8] Icelandic fokka ('to mess around', 'to rush');[9] dialectal Norwegian fukka ('to copulate'); and dialectal Swedish focka ('to strike', 'to copulate') and fock ('penis').[7] This points to a possible etymology where Common Germanic *fuk(k)\u014dn-from the verbal root *fug- ('to blow')[9] comes from an Indo-European root *peuk-, or *peu\u011d- ('to strike'),[10] cognate with non-Germanic words such as Latin pugno ('I fight') or pugnus ('fist').[7] By application of Grimm's law, this hypothetical root also has the Pre-Germanic form *pug-n\u00e9h2- (''to blow'),[9] which is the etymon of, amongst others, Dutch fok(zeil) ('foresail').[11] There is a theory that fuck is most likely derived from German or Dutch roots, and is probably not derived from an Old English root.[12].One reason that the word fuck is difficult to trace etymologically is that it was used far more extensively in common speech, rather than in easily traceable documents or writings.\nQ: what does shut the fuck up mean in spanish?\nReasoning: Fuck

Hallowe'en (less commonly known as Allhalloween,[9] All Hallows' Eve,[10] or All Saints' Eve)[11] is a celebration observed in many countries  on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day.It is at the beginning of the observance of Allhallowtide,[12] the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed.[5][13][14][15] In popular culture, the day has become a celebration of horror, being associated with the macabre and supernatural.[16].One theory holds that many Halloween traditions were influenced by Celtic harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain, which are believed to have pagan roots.[17][18][19][20] Some go further and suggest that Samhain may have been Christianized as All Hallow's Day, along with its eve, by the early Church.[21] Other academics believe Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, being the vigil of All Hallow's Day.[22][23][24][25] Celebrated in Ireland and Scotland for centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants took many Halloween customs to North America in the 19th century,[26][27] and then through American influence various Halloween customs spread to other countries by the late 20th and early 21st century.[16][28].Popular Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the related guising and souling), attending Halloween costume parties, carving pumpkins or turnips into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, and watching horror or Halloween-themed films.[29] Some people practice the Christian observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead,[30][1][31] although it is a secular celebration for others.[32][2][33] Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows' Eve, a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day, including apples, potato pancakes, and soul cakes.[34][35][36][37].The word Halloween or Hallowe'en (\"Saints' evening\"[38]) is of Christian origin;[39][40] a term equivalent to \"All Hallows Eve\" is attested in Old English.[41] The word hallowe[']en comes from the Scottish form of All Hallows' Eve (the evening before All Hallows' Day):[42] even is the Scots term for \"eve\" or \"evening\",[43] and is contracted to e'en or een;[44] (All) Hallow(s) E(v)en became Hallowe'en..Halloween is thought to have influences from Christian beliefs and practices.[45][46] The English word 'Halloween' comes from \"All Hallows' Eve\", being the evening before the Christian holy days of All Hallows' Day (All Saints' Day) on 1 November and All Souls' Day on 2 November.[47] Since the time of the early Church,[48] major feasts in Christianity (such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost) had vigils that began the night before, as did the feast of All Hallows'.[49][45] These three days are collectively called Allhallowtide and are a time when Western Christians honour all saints and pray for recently departed souls who have yet to reach Heaven.Commemorations of all saints and martyrs were held by several churches on various dates, mostly in springtime.[50] In 4th-century Roman Edessa it was held on 13 May, and on 13 May 609, Pope Boniface IV re-dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to \"St Mary and all martyrs\".[51] This was the date of Lemuria, an ancient Roman festival of the dead.[52].In the 8th century, Pope Gregory III (731\u2013741) founded an oratory in St Peter's for the relics \"of the holy apostles and of all saints, martyrs and confessors\".[45][53] Some sources say it was dedicated on 1 November,[54] while others say it was on Palm Sunday in April 732.[55][56] By 800, there is evidence that churches in Ireland[57] and Northumbria were holding a feast commemorating all saints on 1 November.[58] Alcuin of Northumbria, a member of Charlemagne's court, may then have introduced this 1 November date in the Frankish Empire.[59] In 835, it became the official date in the Frankish Empire.[58] Some suggest this was due to Celtic influence, while others suggest it was a Germanic idea,[58] although it is claimed that both Germanic and Celtic-speaking peoples commemorated the dead at the beginning of winter.[60] They may have seen it as the most fitting time to do so, as it is a time of 'dying' in nature.[58][60] It is also suggested the change was made on the \"practical grounds that Rome in summer could not accommodate the great number of pilgrims who flocked to it\", and perhaps because of public health concerns over Roman Fever, which claimed a number of lives during Rome's sultry summers.[61][45].By the end of the 12th century, the celebration had become known as the holy days of obligation in Western Christianity and involved such traditions as ringing church bells for souls in purgatory.It was also \"customary for criers dressed in black to parade the streets, ringing a bell of mournful sound and calling on all good Christians to remember the poor souls\".[63] The Allhallowtide custom of baking and sharing soul cakes for all christened souls,[64] has been suggested as the origin of trick-or-treating.[65] The custom dates back at least as far as the 15th century[66] and was found in parts of England, Wales, Flanders, Bavaria and Austria.[67] Groups of poor people, often children, would go door-to-door during Allhallowtide, collecting soul cakes, in exchange for praying for the dead, especially the souls of the givers' friends and relatives.This was called \"souling\".[66][68][69] Soul cakes were also offered for the souls themselves to eat,[67] or the 'soulers' would act as their representatives.[70] As with the Lenten tradition of hot cross buns, soul cakes were often marked with a cross, indicating they were baked as alms.[71] Shakespeare mentions souling in his comedy The Two Gentlemen of Verona (1593).[72] While souling, Christians would carry \"lanterns made of hollowed-out turnips\", which could have originally represented souls of the dead;[73][74] jack-o'-lanterns were used to ward off evil spirits.[75][76] On All Saints' and All Souls' Day during the 19th century, candles were lit in homes in Ireland,[77] Flanders, Bavaria, and in Tyrol, where they were called \"soul lights\",[78] that served \"to guide the souls back to visit their earthly homes\".[79] In many of these places, candles were also lit at graves on All Souls' Day.[78] In Brittany, libations of milk were poured on the graves of kinfolk,[67] or food would be left overnight on the dinner table for the returning souls;[78] a custom also found in Tyrol and parts of Italy.[80][78].Christian minister Prince Sorie Conteh linked the wearing of costumes to the belief in vengeful ghosts: \"It was traditionally believed that the souls of the departed wandered the earth until All Saints' Day, and All Hallows' Eve provided one last chance for the dead to gain vengeance on their enemies before moving to the next world.\nQ: what does japan call their

is the right of women to vote in elections.In the beginning of the 18th century, some people sought to change voting laws to allow women to vote.Liberal political parties would go on to grant women the right to vote, increasing the number of those parties' potential constituencies.National and international organizations formed to coordinate efforts towards women voting, especially the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (founded in 1904 in Berlin, Germany).[1].Many instances occurred in recent centuries where women were selectively given, then stripped of, the right to vote.In Sweden, conditional women's suffrage was in effect during the Age of Liberty (1718\u20131772).[2].The first territory to continuously allow women to vote was Pitcairn Islands in 1838, and the first sovereign nation was Finland[citation needed] in 1906, as the Kingdom of Hawai'i, which originally had universal suffrage in 1840, rescinded this in 1852 and was subsequently annexed by the United States in 1898.In the years after 1869, a number of provinces held by the British and Russian empires conferred women's suffrage, and some of these became sovereign nations at a later point, like New Zealand, Australia, and Finland.Several states and territories of the United States, such as Wyoming (1869) and Utah (1870), also granted women the right to vote.Women who owned property gained the right to vote in the Isle of Man in 1881, and in 1893, women in the then self-governing[3] British colony of New Zealand were granted the right to vote.In Australia, the colony of South Australia conferred voter rights on all women from 1894, and the right to stand for Parliament from 1895, while the Australian Federal Parliament conferred the right to vote and stand for election in 1902 (although it allowed for the exclusion of \"aboriginal natives\").[4][5] Prior to independence, in the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland, women gained equal suffrage, with both the right to vote and to stand as candidates in 1906.[6][7][8] Most major Western powers extended voting rights to women in the interwar period, including Canada (1917), the United Kingdom and Germany (1918), Austria, the Netherlands (1919) and the United States (1920).Notable exceptions in Europe were France, where women could not vote until 1944, Greece (equal voting rights for women did not exist there until 1952,

doctrines.[7][8] Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent, and the establishment of God's kingdom over earth is the only solution to all of humanity's problems.[9].The group emerged from the Bible Student movement founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell, who also co-founded Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881 to organize and print the movement's publications.[3] A leadership dispute after Russell's death resulted in several groups breaking away, with Joseph Franklin Rutherford retaining control of the Watch Tower Society and its properties.[10] Rutherford made significant organizational and doctrinal changes,[11] including adoption of the name Jehovah's witnesses[en 2] in 1931 to distinguish the group from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell's traditions.[13][14].Jehovah's Witnesses are known for their door-to-door preaching, distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake!, and for refusing military service and blood transfusions.They consider the use of God's name vital for proper worship.They reject Trinitarianism, inherent immortality of the soul, and hellfire, which they consider unscriptural doctrines.They do not observe Christmas, Easter, birthdays, or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity.[15] They prefer to use their own Bible translation, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.[16][17] Witnesses commonly call their body of beliefs \"The Truth\" and consider themselves to be \"in the Truth\".[18] They consider human society morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan, and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses.[19].Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping, their term for formal expulsion and shunning, a last resort for what they consider serious offenses.[20][21] Baptized people who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned.Disfellowshipped and disassociated people may eventually be reinstated.[22] Former members can experience significant mental distress as a result of this ostracism,[23] and some seek reinstatement to keep contact with their friends and family.[22].The group's position on conscientious objection to military service and refusal to salute state symbols (like national anthems and flags) has brought it into conflict with some governments.[24] Some Jehovah's Witnesses have been persecuted, and their activities banned or restricted in some

maintaining blood pressure .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: The baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the body's homeostatic mechanisms that helps to maintain blood pressure at nearly constant levels.The baroreflex provides a rapid negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure causes the heart rate to decrease.Decreased blood pressure decreases baroreflex activation and causes heart rate to increase and to restore blood pressure levels.Their function is to sense pressure changes by responding to change in the tension of the arterial wall[1] The baroreflex can begin to act in less than the duration of a cardiac cycle (fractions of a second) and thus baroreflex adjustments are key factors in dealing with postural hypotension, the tendency for blood pressure to decrease on standing due to gravity..The system relies on specialized neurons, known as baroreceptors, chiefly in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses, to monitor changes in blood pressure and relay them to the medulla oblongata.Baroreceptors are stretch receptors and respond to the pressure induced stretching of the blood vessel in which they are found.Baroreflex-induced changes in blood pressure are mediated by both branches of the autonomic nervous system: the parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves.Baroreceptors are active even at normal blood pressures so their activity informs the brain about both increases and decreases in blood pressure..The body contains two other, slower-acting systems to regulate blood pressure: the heart releases atrial natriuretic peptide when blood pressure is too high, and the kidneys sense and correct low blood pressure with the renin\u2013angiotensin system.[2].Baroreceptors are present in the atria of the heart and vena cavae, but the most sensitive baroreceptors are in the carotid sinuses and aortic arch.While the carotid sinus baroreceptor axons travel within the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), the aortic arch baroreceptor axons travel within the vagus nerve (CN X).Baroreceptor activity travels along these nerves directly into the central nervous system to excite glutamatergic neurons within the solitary nucleus (SN) in the brainstem.[3] Baroreceptor information flows from these NSS neurons to both parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons within the brainstem.[citation needed].\nQ: what happens when the baroreceptor reflex is

occurred on California's Central Coast on October 17 at 5:04 p.m.local time.The shock was centered in The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park in Santa Cruz County, approximately 10mi (16km) northeast of Santa Cruz on a section of the San Andreas Fault System and was named for the nearby Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains.With an Mw magnitude of 6.9[10] and a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent), the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries.The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (to the degree that it was designated a seismic gap) until two moderate foreshocks occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989..Damage was heavy in Santa Cruz County and less so to the south in Monterey County, but effects extended well to the north into the San Francisco Bay Area, both on the San Francisco Peninsula and across the bay in Oakland.No surface faulting occurred, though many other ground failures and landslides were present, especially in the Summit area of the Santa Cruz Mountains.Liquefaction was also a significant issue, especially in the heavily damaged Marina District of San Francisco, but its effects were also seen in the East Bay, and near the shore of Monterey Bay, where a non-destructive tsunami was also observed.[11].Because it happened during a national live broadcast of the 1989 World Series, the annual championship series of Major League Baseball, taking place between Bay Area teams San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics, it is sometimes referred to as the \"World Series earthquake\", with the championship games of the year being referred to as the \"Earthquake Series\".Rush-hour traffic on the Bay Area freeways was lighter than normal because the game, being played at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, was about to begin, and this may have prevented a larger loss of life, as several of the Bay Area's major transportation structures suffered catastrophic failures.The collapse of a section of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland was the site of the largest number of casualties for the event, but the collapse of man-made structures and other related accidents contributed to casualties occurring in San Francisco, Los Altos, and Santa Cruz..The history of earthquake investigations in California has

production is the family of industrial methods for generating hydrogen.", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Hydrogen production is the family of industrial methods for generating hydrogen gas..There are four main sources for the commercial production of hydrogen: natural gas, oil, coal, and electrolysis of water; which account for 48%, 30%, 18% and 4% of the world's hydrogen production respectively.[1] Fossil fuels are the dominant source of industrial hydrogen.[2] As of 2020, the majority of hydrogen (~95%) is produced by steam reforming of natural gas and other light hydrocarbons, partial oxidation of heavier hydrocarbons, and coal gasification.[3][4] Other methods of hydrogen production include biomass gasification and methane pyrolysis.Methane pyrolysis and water electrolysis can use any source of electricity including renewable energy..The production of hydrogen plays a key role in any industrialized society, since hydrogen is required for many chemical processes.[5] In 2020, roughly 87 million tons of hydrogen was produced[6] worldwide for various uses, such as oil refining, in the production of ammonia through the Haber process, and in the production of methanol through reduction of carbon monoxide.The global hydrogen generation market was valued at US$155 billion in 2022, and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.3% from 2023 to 2030.[7].Steam methane reforming (SMR) produces hydrogen from natural gas, mostly methane (CH4), and water.It is the cheapest source of industrial hydrogen, being the source of nearly 50% of the world's hydrogen.[8] The process consists of heating the gas to 700\u20131,100\u00b0C (1,300\u20132,000\u00b0F) in the presence of steam over a nickel catalyst.The resulting endothermic reaction  forms carbon monoxide and molecular hydrogen (H2).[9].In the water-gas shift reaction, the carbon monoxide reacts with steam  to obtain further quantities of H2.The WGSR also requires a catalyst, typically over iron oxide or other oxides.The byproduct is CO2.[9] Depending on the quality of the feedstock (natural gas, naphtha, etc.), one ton of hydrogen produced will also produce 9 to 12 tons of CO2, a greenhouse gas that may be captured.[10].For this process, high temperature steam (H2O) reacts with methane (CH4) in an endothermic reaction to yield syngas.[11].\nQ: how is hydrogen

points are used as a convenient unit of measurement in contexts where percentage differences of less than 1% are discussed.The most common example is interest rates, where differences in interest rates of less than 1% per year are usually meaningful to talk about.For example, a difference of 0.10 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 basis points (e.g., a 4.67% rate increases by 10

discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate.For example,  if a report says there has been a \"1% increase\" from a 10% interest rate, this could refer to an increase either from 10% to 10.1% (relative, 1% of 10%), or from 10% to 11% (absolute, 1% plus 10%).However, if the report says there has been a \"100 basis point increase\" from a 10% interest rate, then the interest rate of 10% has increased by 1.00% (the absolute change) to an 11% rate..It is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate

Jamaica, and south of The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.It occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the Dominican Republic.[20][21] To its south-west lies the small Navassa Island, which is claimed by Haiti but is disputed as a United States territory under federal administration.[22][23] Haiti is 27,750km2 (10,714sqmi) in size, the third largest country in the Caribbean by area, and has an estimated population of 11.4 million,[24][25] making it the most populous country in the Caribbean.The capital is Port-au-Prince..The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people, who originated in South America.[26] The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus.[27] Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas, La Navidad, on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti.[28][29][30][31] The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola, forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century.However, competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697, which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue.French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations, worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa, which made the colony one of the richest in the world..In the midst of the French Revolution (1789\u201399), slaves, maroons, and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804), led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army, Toussaint Louverture.After 12 years of conflict, Napoleon Bonaparte's forces were defeated by Louverture's successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines (later Emperor Jacques I), who declared Haiti's sovereignty on 1 January 1804\u2014the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean, the second republic in the Americas, the first country in the Americas to eliminate slavery, and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt.[32][33] Apart from Alexandre P\u00e9tion, the first President of the Republic, all of Haiti's first leaders were former slaves.[34] After a brief period in which the country was split in two, President Jean-Pierre Boyer united the country and then attempted to expand Haitian influence over the eastern part of Hispaniola, which eventually led to the Haitian\u2013Dominican Wars.Haiti recognized Dominican independence in 1867, following their declaration in 1844..Haiti's first century of independence was characterized by political instability, ostracism by the international community, and the payment of a crippling debt to France.Political volatility and foreign economic influence in the country prompted the United States to occupy the country from 1915 to 1934.Following a series of short-lived presidencies, Fran\u00e7ois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier took power in 1957, ushering in a long period of

telecommunications device that receives and displays alphanumeric or voice messages.One-way pagers can only receive messages, while response pagers and two-way pagers can also acknowledge, reply to, and originate messages using an internal transmitter.[2] In Japanese, it was commonly called a pocket bell (\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30d9\u30eb, poketto beru) or pokeberu (\u30dd\u30b1\u30d9\u30eb),[3] which is an example of wasei-eigo..Pagers operate as part of a paging system which includes one or more fixed transmitters (or in the case of response pagers and two-way pagers, one or more base stations), as well as a number of pagers carried by mobile users.These systems can range from a restaurant system with a single low power transmitter, to a nationwide system with thousands of high-power base stations..Pagers were developed in the 1950s and 1960s,[4] and became widely used by the 1980s through the late 1990s and early 2000s.In the 21st century, the widespread availability of cellphones and smartphones with text messaging capability has greatly diminished the pager industry.Nevertheless, pagers continue to be used by some emergency services and public safety personnel, because modern pager systems' coverage overlap, combined with use of satellite communications, can make paging systems more reliable than terrestrial based cellular networks in some cases, including during natural and human-made disasters.[5] This resilience has led public safety agencies to adopt pagers over cellular and other commercial services for critical messaging.[6][7].The first telephone pager system was patented in 1949 by Alfred J.Gross.[8].One of the first practical paging services was launched in 1950 for physicians in the New York City area.Physicians paid US$12 per month for the service and carried a 200-gram (7oz) pager that would receive phone messages within 40 kilometres (25mi) of a single transmitter tower.The system was manufactured by the Reevesound Company and operated by Telanswerphone.[9] In 1960, John Francis Mitchell combined elements of Motorola's walkie-talkie and automobile radio technologies to create the

proteins and fat from milk (usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep).During production, milk is usually acidified and either the enzymes of rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate.The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese.[1] Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout..Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are produced in various countries.Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged.Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents.The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto.Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives, or cranberries.A cheesemonger, or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting, purchasing, receiving, storing and ripening cheeses.[2].For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice.Most cheeses

Rogue waves (also known as freak waves, monster waves, episodic waves, killer waves, extreme waves, and abnormal waves) are unusually large, unpredictable, and suddenly appearing surface waves that can be extremely dangerous to ships and isolated structures such as lighthouses.[1] They are distinct from tsunamis, which are often almost unnoticeable in deep waters and are caused by the displacement of water due to other phenomena (such as earthquakes).A rogue wave at the shore is sometimes called a sneaker wave.[2].In oceanography, rogue waves are more precisely defined as waves whose height is more than twice the significant wave height (Hs or SWH), itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record.Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single exceptionally large wave.[1].Among other causes, studies of nonlinear waves such as the Peregrine soliton, and waves modeled by the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NLS), suggest that modulational instability can create an unusual sea state where a \"normal\" wave begins to draw energy from other nearby waves, and briefly becomes very large.Such phenomena are not limited to water and are also studied in liquid helium, nonlinear optics, and microwave cavities.A 2012 study reported that in addition to the Peregrine soliton reaching up to about three times the height of the surrounding sea, a hierarchy of higher order wave solutions could also exist having progressively larger sizes, and demonstrated the creation of a \"super rogue wave\" \u2014a breather around five times higher than surrounding waves\u2014 in a water-wave tank.[3].A 2012 study supported the existence of oceanic rogue holes, the inverse of rogue waves, where the depth of the hole can reach more than twice the significant wave height.Rogue holes have been replicated in experiments using water-wave tanks but have not been confirmed in the real world.[4].Rogue waves are open-water phenomena, in which winds, currents, nonlinear phenomena such as solitons, and other circumstances cause a wave to briefly form that is far larger than the \"average\" large wave (the significant wave height or \"SWH\") of that time and place.The basic underlying physics that makes phenomena such as rogue waves possible is that different waves can travel at different speeds, so they can \"pile up\" in certain circumstances, known as \"constructive interference\".(In deep ocean, the speed of a gravity wave is proportional to the square root of its wavelength, the peak-to-peak distance between adjacent waves.) However, other situations can also give rise to rogue waves, particularly situations where nonlinear effects or instability effects can cause energy to move between waves and be concentrated in one or very few extremely large waves before returning to \"normal\" conditions..\nQ: What causes rogue waves\nReasoning: The Draupner wave , a single giant wave measured on New Year's Day 1995, finally

War II have been given considerable attention by historians.The immediate precipitating event was the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany on September 1, 1939, and the subsequent declarations of war on Germany made by Britain and France, but many other prior events have been suggested as ultimate causes.Primary themes in historical analysis of the war's origins include the political takeover of Germany in 1933 by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party; Japanese militarism against China, which led to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and the Second Sino-Japanese War; Italian aggression against Ethiopia, which led to the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the consent of Western countries to Germany's actions on the annexation of Austria and the partition of Czechoslovakia and Germany's initial success in negotiating the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviet Union to divide the territorial control of Eastern Europe between them..During the interwar period, deep anger arose in the Weimar Republic on the conditions of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which punished Germany for its role in World War I with heavy financial reparations and severe limitations on its military that were intended to prevent it from becoming a military power again.The demilitarisation of the Rhineland, the prohibition of German unification with Austria, the loss of its overseas colonies and of some 12% of its pre-war land area and population provoked strong currents of revanchism in German politics..During the worldwide economic crisis of the Great Depression in the 1930s, many people lost faith in liberal democracy and countries across the world turned to authoritarian regimes.[1] In Germany, resentment over the terms of the Treaty of Versailles was intensified by the instability of the German political system, as many on both the Right and the Left rejected the Weimar Republic liberalism.The most extreme political aspirant to emerge from that situation was Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi Party.The Nazis took totalitarian power in Germany from 1933 and demanded the undoing of the Versailles provisions.Their ambitious and aggressive domestic and foreign policies reflected their ideologies of Antisemitism, unification of all Germans, the acquisition of \"living space\" (Lebensraum) for agrarian settlers, the elimination of Bolshevism and the hegemony of an \"Aryan\"/\"Nordic\" master race over \"subhumans\" (Untermenschen) such as Jews and Slavs.Other factors leading to the war included the aggression by Fascist Italy against Ethiopia and by Imperial Japan against China..At first, the aggressive moves met with only feeble and ineffectual policies of appeasement from the other major world powers.The League of Nations proved helpless, especially

million units.[4] It began as a compact sedan, but over the course of its life evolved into a mid-size car.Initial production was based in Japan, but from 1994 the American market was served by vehicles assembled at the former Diamond-Star Motors (DSM) facility in Normal, Illinois..The first generation of the car, initially known as the Colt Galant, was released in December 1969 at a new

results from the heart pumping blood through the circulatory system.When used without qualification, the term \"blood pressure\" refers to the pressure in a brachial artery, where it is most commonly measured.Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum pressure during one heartbeat) over diastolic pressure (minimum pressure between two heartbeats) in the cardiac cycle.It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) above the surrounding atmospheric pressure, or in kilopascals (kPa)..Blood pressure is one of the vital signs\u2014together with respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature\u2014that healthcare professionals use in evaluating a patient's health.Normal resting blood pressure,  in an adult is approximately 120 millimetres

to the present, at approx.127/79 mmHg in men and 122/77 mmHg in women, although these average data mask significantly diverging regional trends.[1].Traditionally, a health-care worker measured blood pressure non-invasively by auscultation (listening) through a stethoscope for sounds in one arm's artery as the artery is squeezed, closer to the heart, by an aneroid gauge or a mercury-tube sphygmomanometer.[2] Auscultation is still generally considered to be the gold standard of accuracy for non-invasive blood pressure readings in clinic.[3] However, semi-automated methods have become common, largely due to concerns about potential mercury toxicity,[4] although cost, ease of use and applicability to ambulatory blood pressure or home blood pressure measurements have also influenced this trend.[5] Early automated alternatives to mercury-tube sphygmomanometers were often seriously inaccurate, but modern devices validated to international standards achieve an average difference between two standardized reading methods of 5mm Hg or less, and a standard deviation of less than 8mm Hg.[5] Most of these semi-automated methods measure blood pressure using oscillometry (measurement by a pressure transducer in the cuff of the device of small oscillations of.intra-cuff pressure accompanying heartbeat-induced changes in the volume of each pulse).[6].Blood pressure is influenced by

abbreviated MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a long-term neuromuscular junction disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness.[1] The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing.[1][5] It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking.[1] Onset can be sudden.[1] Those affected often have a large thymus or develop a thymoma.[1].Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuro-muscular junction which results from antibodies that block or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the junction between the nerve and muscle.[6][7][1] This prevents nerve impulses from triggering muscle contractions.[1] Most cases are due to immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG3 antibodies that attack AChR in the postsynaptic membrane, causing complement-mediated damage and muscle weakness.[8] Rarely, an inherited genetic defect in the neuromuscular junction results in a similar condition known as congenital myasthenia.[9][10] Babies of mothers with myasthenia may have symptoms during their first few months of life, known as neonatal myasthenia.[1] Diagnosis can be supported by blood tests for specific antibodies, the edrophonium test, or a nerve conduction study.[1].MG is generally treated with medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine.[1] Immunosuppressants, such as prednisone or azathioprine, may also be used.[1] The surgical removal of the thymus may improve symptoms in certain cases.[1] Plasmapheresis and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin may be used during sudden flares of the condition.[1] If the breathing muscles become significantly weak, mechanical ventilation may be required.[1] Once intubated acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be temporarily held to reduce airway secretions.[11].MG affects 50 to 200 people per million.[3][4] It is newly diagnosed in 3 to 30 people per million each year.[12] Diagnosis has become more common due to increased awareness.[12] MG most commonly occurs in women under the age of 40 and in men over the age of 60.[1][13][14] It is uncommon in children.[1] With treatment, most of those affected lead relatively normal lives and have a normal life expectancy.[1] The word is from the Greek mys, \"muscle\" and astheneia \"weakness\", and the Latin gravis, \"serious\".[15].The initial, main symptom in MG is painless weakness of specific muscles, not fatigue.[16] The muscle weakness becomes progressively worse during periods of physical activity and improves after periods of rest.Typically, the weakness and fatigue are worse toward the end of the day.[17] MG generally starts with ocular (eye) weakness; it might then progress to a more severe generalized form, characterized by weakness in the extremities or in muscles that govern basic life functions.[18].In about two-thirds of individuals, the initial symptom of MG is related to the muscles around the eye.[16] Eyelid drooping (ptosis may occur due to weakness of m.levator palpebrae superioris)[19] and double vision (diplopia,[16] due to weakness of the extraocular muscles).[17] Eye symptoms tend to get worse when watching television, reading, or driving, particularly in bright conditions.[16] Consequently, some affected individuals choose to wear sunglasses.[16] The term \"ocular myasthenia gravis\" describes a subtype of MG where muscle weakness is confined to the eyes, i.e.extraocular muscles, m.levator palpebrae superioris, and m.orbicularis oculi.[19] Typically, this subtype evolves into generalized MG, usually after a few years.[19].The weakness of the muscles involved in swallowing may lead to swallowing difficulty (dysphagia).\nQ: how many people die from myasthenia gravis per year\nReasoning: Myasthenia gravis (from Greek \u03bc\u03cd\u03c2 \"muscle\",

or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers.Liquid crystals do not emit light directly[1] but instead use a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome.[2] LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images with low information content, which can be displayed or hidden: preset words, digits, and seven-segment displays (as in a digital clock) are all examples of devices with these displays.They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are made from a matrix of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements.LCDs can either be normally on (positive) or off (negative), depending on the polarizer arrangement.For example, a character positive LCD with a backlight will have black lettering on a background that is the color of the backlight, and a character negative LCD will have a black background with the letters being of the same color as the backlight.Optical filters are added to white on blue LCDs to give them their characteristic appearance..LCDs are used in a wide range of applications, including LCD televisions, computer monitors, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays, and indoor and outdoor signage.Small LCD screens are common in LCD projectors and portable consumer devices such as digital cameras, watches, calculators, and mobile telephones, including smartphones.LCD screens have replaced heavy, bulky and less energy-efficient cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays in nearly all applications.The phosphors used in CRTs make them vulnerable to image burn-in when a static image is displayed on a screen for a long time, e.g., the table frame for an airline flight schedule on an indoor sign.LCDs do not have this weakness, but are still susceptible to image persistence.[3].Each pixel of an LCD typically consists of a layer of molecules aligned between two transparent electrodes, often made of indium tin oxide (ITO) and two polarizing filters (parallel and perpendicular polarizers), the axes of transmission of which are (in most of the cases) perpendicular to each other.\nQ: How LCD Monitors Work\nReasoning: Reflective twisted nematic liquid crystal display."}, {"question_id": "Q854", "question": "how many rooms in borgata hotel",

from the eponymous island, though nearly all its land area is on the mainland.Rhode Island borders Connecticut to its west; Massachusetts to its north and east; and the Atlantic Ocean to its south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound; and shares a small maritime border with New York, east of Long Island.[9] Providence is its capital and most populous city..Native Americans lived around Narragansett Bay for thousands of years before English settlers began arriving in the early 17th century.[10] Rhode Island was unique among the Thirteen British Colonies in having been founded by a refugee, Roger Williams, who fled religious persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to establish a haven for religious liberty.He founded Providence in 1636 on land purchased from local tribes, creating the first settlement in North America with an explicitly secular government.[10] The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations subsequently became a destination for religious and political dissenters and social outcasts, earning it the moniker \"Rogue's Island.\"[11].Rhode Island was the first colony to call for a Continental Congress, which it did in 1774, and the first to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown, which it did on May 4, 1776.[12] After the American Revolution, during which it was heavily occupied and contested, Rhode Island became the fourth state to ratify the Articles of Confederation, which it did on February 9, 1778.[13] Because its citizens favored a weaker central government, it boycotted the 1787 convention that had drafted the United States Constitution,[14] which it initially refused to ratify;[15] it finally did ratify it on May 29, 1790, the last of the original 13 states to do so.[16][17].The state was officially named the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations since the colonial era, but came to be commonly known as \"Rhode Island\".In November 2020, the state's voters approved an amendment to the state constitution formally dropping \"and Providence Plantations\" from its full name.[18] Its official nickname is the \"Ocean State\", a reference to its 400mi (640km) of coastline and the large bays and inlets that make up about 14% of its total area.[19].Despite its name, most of Rhode Island is on the mainland of the United States.Its official name was State of Rhode Island and Providence

ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle by acting as a huge heat reservoir..Oceanographers split the ocean into vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions.The pelagic zone is the open ocean's water column from the surface to the ocean floor.The water column is further divided into zones based on depth and the amount of light present.The photic zone starts at the surface and is defined to be \"the depth at which light intensity is only 1% of the surface value\"[13]:\u200a36\u200a (approximately 200m in the open ocean).This is the zone where photosynthesis can occur.In this process plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) use light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients to produce organic matter.As a result, the photic zone is the most biodiverse and the source of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem.Ocean photosynthesis also produces half of the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere.[14] Light can only penetrate a few hundred more meters; the rest of the deeper ocean is cold and dark (these zones are called mesopelagic and aphotic zones).\nQ: how much of earth

blues.In 1955, drummer D.J.Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades.Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States.Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles.With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll; though his performative style and promotion

"Context: Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation.It is a form of luminescence.In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore a lower photon energy, than the absorbed radiation.A perceptible example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum (invisible to the human eye), while the emitted light is in the visible region; this gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can only be seen when the substance has been exposed to UV light.Fluorescent materials cease to glow nearly immediately when the radiation source stops, unlike phosphorescent materials, which continue to emit light for some time after..Fluorescence has many practical applications, including mineralogy, gemology, medicine, chemical sensors (fluorescence spectroscopy), fluorescent labelling, dyes, biological detectors, cosmic-ray detection, vacuum fluorescent displays, and cathode-ray tubes.Its most common everyday application is in (gas-discharge) fluorescent lamps and LED lamps, in which fluorescent coatings convert UV or blue light into longer-wavelengths resulting in white light which can even appear indistinguishable from that of the traditional but energy- inefficient incandescent lamp..Fluorescence also occurs frequently in nature in some minerals and in many biological forms across all kingdoms of life.The latter may be referred to as biofluorescence, indicating that the fluorophore is part of or is extracted from a living organism (rather than an inorganic dye or stain).But since fluorescence is due to a specific chemical, which can also be synthesized artificially in most cases, it is sufficient to describe the substance itself as fluorescent..An early observation of fluorescence was described in 1560 by Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan and in 1565 by Nicol\u00e1s Monardes in the

these roles starting in the early 2000s..The earliest theoretical work on optical disc storage was done by independent researchers in the United States including David Paul Gregg (1958) and James Russel (1965\u20131975).In particular, Gregg's patents were used as the basis of the LaserDisc specification that was co-developed between MCA and Philips after MCA purchased Gregg's patents, as well as the company he founded, Gauss Electrophysics.[3] The LaserDisc was the immediate precursor to the CD, with the primary difference being that the LaserDisc encoded information through an analog process whereas the CD used digital encoding..Key work to digitize the optical disc was performed by Toshi Doi and Kees Schouhamer Immink during 1979\u20131980, who worked on a taskforce for Sony and Philips.[4] The result was the Compact Disc Digital Audio (CD-DA), defined on 1980.The CD-ROM was later designed as an extension of the CD-DA, and adapted this format to hold any form of digital data, with an initial storage capacity of 553 MB.[5] Sony and Philips created the technical standard that defines the format of a CD-ROM in 1983,[6] in what came to be called the Yellow Book.The CD-ROM was announced in 1984[7] and introduced by Denon and Sony at the first Japanese COMDEX computer show in 1985.[8] In November, 1985, several computer industry participants including Microsoft, Philips,

"label": 0, "input": "Context: Lent (Latin: Quadragesima,[1] 'Fortieth') is the solemn Christian religious observance in the liturgical year commemorating the 40 days Jesus Christ spent fasting in the desert and enduring temptation by Satan, according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, before beginning his public ministry.[2][3] Lent is observed in the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, Moravian, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, United Protestant and Roman Catholic traditions of Christianity.[4][5] Some Anabaptist, Baptist, Reformed (including certain Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches), and nondenominational Christian churches also observe Lent, although many churches in these traditions do not.[6][7][8][9][10][11].Which days are enumerated as being part of Lent differs between denominations (see below), although in all of them Lent is described as lasting for a total duration of 40 days, the number of days Jesus, as well as Moses and Elijah, went without food in their respective fasts.[12][13][14] In Lent-observing Western Churches, Lent begins on Ash Wednesday and ends approximately six weeks later; depending on the Christian denomination and local custom, Lent concludes either on the evening of Maundy Thursday,[15] or at sundown on Holy Saturday, when the Easter Vigil is celebrated,[16] though in either case, Lenten fasting observances are maintained until the evening of Holy Saturday.[17] Sundays may or may not be excluded, depending on the denomination.In Eastern Christianity \u2013 including Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholics, Eastern Lutherans, and Oriental Orthodox \u2013 Lent is observed continuously without interruption for 40 days starting on Clean Monday and ending on Lazarus Saturday before Holy Week.[18][19].Lent is a period of grief that necessarily ends with a great celebration of Easter.Thus, it is known in Eastern Orthodox circles as the season of \"bright sadness\" (Greek: \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03b7, romanized:charmolyp\u00ea).[20] The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer for Easter through prayer, mortifying the flesh, repentance of sins, almsgiving, simple living, and self-denial.[21] In Lent, many Christians commit to fasting, as well as giving up certain luxuries in imitation of Jesus Christ's sacrifice during his journey into the desert for 40 days;[22][23][24] this is known as one's Lenten sacrifice.[25].Many Lent-observing Christians also add a Lenten spiritual discipline, such as reading a daily devotional or praying through a Lenten calendar, to draw themselves near to God.[26][27] Often observed are the Stations of the Cross, a devotional commemoration of Christ's carrying the Cross and crucifixion.Many churches remove flowers from their altars and veil crucifixes, religious statues that show the triumphant Christ, and other elaborate religious symbols in violet fabrics in solemn observance of the event.The custom of veiling is typically practiced the last two weeks, beginning on the Sunday Judica which is therefore in the vernacular called Passion Sunday until Good Friday, when the cross is unveiled solemnly in the liturgy..In most Lent-observing denominations, the last week of Lent coincides with Holy Week, starting with Palm Sunday.Following the New Testament narrative, Jesus' crucifixion is commemorated on Good Friday, and at the beginning of the next week the joyful celebration of Easter Sunday, the start of the Easter season, which recalls the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.In some Christian denominations, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday form the Easter Triduum.[28].The English word Lent is a shortened form of the Old English word lencten, meaning \"spring season\", as its Dutch language cognate lente (Old Dutch lentin)[30] still does today.\nQ: what do people usually give up for lent\nReasoning: Lent celebrants carrying

city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR, close to the border with the Byelorussian SSR, in the Soviet Union.[1] It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven\u2014the maximum severity\u2014on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.The initial emergency response and subsequent mitigation efforts involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18billion roubles\u2014roughly US$68billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation.[2] It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history.[3][4][5].The accident occurred during a test of the steam turbine's ability to power the emergency feedwater pumps in the event of a simultaneous loss of external power and coolant pipe rupture.Following an accidental drop in reactor power to near-zero, the operators restarted the reactor in preparation for the turbine test with a prohibited control rod configuration.Upon successful completion of the test, the reactor was then shut down for maintenance.Due to a variety of factors, this action resulted in a power surge at the base of the reactor which brought about the rupture of reactor components and the loss of coolant.This process led to steam explosions and a meltdown, which destroyed the containment building.This was followed by a reactor core fire which lasted until 4 May 1986, during which airborne radioactive contaminants were spread throughout the USSR and Europe.[6][7] In response to the initial accident, a 10-kilometre (6.2mi) radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident, from which approximately 49,000 people were evacuated, primarily from Pripyat.The exclusion zone was later increased to a radius of 30 kilometres (19mi), from which an additional ~68,000 people were evacuated.[8].Following the reactor explosion, which killed two engineers and severely burned two more, an emergency operation to put out the fires and stabilize the surviving reactor began, during which 237 workers were hospitalized, of which 134 exhibited symptoms of acute radiation syndrome (ARS).Among those hospitalized, 28 died within the following three months.In the following 10 years, 14 more workers (9 of whom had been hospitalized with ARS) died of various causes mostly unrelated to radiation exposure.[9] 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were attributed to the disaster as of 2011[update].[10][11] A United Nations committee found that to date fewer than 100 deaths have resulted from the fallout.[12] Model predictions of the eventual total death toll in the coming decades

"Antoine Lavoisier 's discovery of the Law of Conservation of Mass led to many new findings in the 19th century.", "label": 0, "input": "Context: In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy, the mass of the system must remain constant over time, as the system's mass cannot change, so the quantity can neither be added nor be removed.Therefore, the quantity of mass is conserved over time.[1].The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form.For example, in chemical reactions, the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction.Thus, during any chemical reaction and low-energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants, or starting materials, must be equal to the mass of the products..The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry, mechanics, and fluid dynamics.Historically, mass conservation in chemical reactions was primarily demonstrated in the 17th century[2] and finally confirmed by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century.The formulation of this law was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry..In reality, the conservation of mass only holds approximately and is considered part of a series of assumptions in classical mechanics.The law has to be modified to comply with the laws of quantum mechanics and special relativity under the principle of mass\u2013energy equivalence, which states that energy and mass form one conserved quantity.For very energetic systems the conservation of mass only is shown not to hold, as is the case in nuclear reactions and particle-antiparticle annihilation in particle physics..Mass is also not generally

written when the disk is inserted into a floppy disk drive (FDD) connected to or inside a computer or other device..The first floppy disks, invented and made by IBM, had a disk diameter of 8 inches (203.2mm).[1] Subsequently, the 5\u00bc-inch and then the 3\u00bd-inch became a ubiquitous form of data storage and transfer into the first years of the 21st century.[2] 3\u00bd-inch floppy disks can

group coded recording (GCR).The 5\u00bc-inch format displaced the 8-inch one for most uses, and the hard-sectored disk format disappeared.The most common capacity of the 5\u00bc-inch format in

cut fastball or cutter is a type of fastball that breaks toward the pitcher's glove-hand side, as it reaches home plate.[1] This pitch is somewhere between a slider and a four-seam fastball, as it is usually thrown faster than a slider but with more movement than a typical fastball.[1] Some pitchers use a cutter to prevent hitters from expecting their regular fastballs.A common technique for throwing a cutter is to use a four-seam fastball grip with the baseball set slightly off center in the hand.[2] A batter hitting a cutter pitch often achieves only soft contact and an easy out due to the pitch's movement keeping the ball away from the bat's sweet spot.The cutter is typically 2\u20135mph slower than a pitcher's four-seam fastball.In 2010, the average pitch classified as a cutter by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6mph; the average two-seamer was 90.97mph.[3].The New York Yankees' former closer Mariano Rivera, one of the foremost practitioners of the cutter,[1] made the pitch famous after the mid-1990s, though the pitch itself has been around since at least the 1950s.[4].When the cut fastball is pitched skillfully at speed, particularly against the opposite hand batter (that is, a right-handed pitcher facing a left-handed hitter), the pitch can crack and split a hitter's bat, hence the pitch's occasional nickname of \"the buzzsaw\".Batter Ryan Klesko, then of the Atlanta Braves, broke three bats in a single plate appearance during the 1999 World Series while facing Rivera.To deal with this problem a few switch hitters batted right-handed against the right-handed Rivera\u2014that is, on the \"wrong\" side, as switch hitters generally bat from the same side of the plate as the pitcher's glove hand.[5].In 2011, Dan Haren led all major league starting pitchers with nearly 48% of his pitches classified by PITCHf/x as cutters.Roy Halladay was close behind at 45%.[6] Other pitchers who rely (or relied) heavily on a cut fastball include Jon Lester, James Shields, Josh Tomlin, Will Harris, Mark Melancon, Jaime Garcia, Wade Miley, David Robertson, Jerry Reuss, Andy Pettitte, and Corbin Burnes.[7][8][9] Over the course of Kenley Jansen's career from (2010\u2013present)[10] he has thrown his cutter 85.1% of the time, second only to Rivera at 87.2% among pitchers with at least 30 innings during that time period.[11].The cutter grew in popularity as certain pitchers, including  Dan Haren, looked to compensate for loss of speed in their four-seam fastball.[1] Braves third baseman Chipper Jones attributed the increased dominance of pitchers from 2010\u20132011 to a more prolific use of the cutter, as did Cleveland Indians pitcher Chris Perez.[12][13] By 2011, it was commonly being called the \"pitch du jour\" in the baseball press.[7][14].Some pushback has developed against (overuse of) the pitch, due to concerns that a pitcher overusing the cutter could develop arm fatigue.[15] Baltimore Orioles General Manager Dan Duquette instructed prized prospect Dylan Bundy not to throw the pitch in the minor leagues, believing its use could make Bundy's fastball and curve less effective.[16].\nQ: what does a cutter

epic cycle.[2].Son of La\u00ebrtes and Anticlea, husband of Penelope, and father of Telemachus, Acusilaus, and Telegonus[3] Odysseus is renowned for his intellectual brilliance, guile, and versatility (polytropos), and is thus known by the epithet Odysseus the Cunning (Greek: \u03bc\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, translit.m\u00eatis, lit.\"cunning intelligence\"[4]).He is most famous for his nostos, or \"homecoming\", which took him ten eventful years after the decade-long Trojan War..The form \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3(\u03c3)\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 Odys(s)eus is used starting in the epic period and through the classical period, but various other forms are also found.In vase inscriptions, we find the variants Oliseus (\u1f48\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), Olyseus (\u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), Olysseus (\u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), Olyteus (\u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), Olytteus

in an early source in Magna Graecia (Ibycus, according to Diomedes Grammaticus), while the Greek grammarian Aelius Herodianus has Oulixeus (\u039f\u1f50\u03bb\u03b9\u03be\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2).[5] In Latin, he was known as Ulix\u0113s or (considered less correct) Ulyss\u0113s.Some have supposed that \"there may originally have been two separate figures, one called something like Odysseus, the other something like Ulixes, who were combined into one complex personality.\"[6] However, the change between d and l is common also in some Indo-European and Greek names,[7] and the Latin form is supposed to be derived from the Etruscan Uthuze (see below), which perhaps accounts for some of the phonetic innovations..The etymology of the name is unknown.Ancient authors linked the name to the Greek verbs odussomai (\u1f40\u03b4\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) \"to be wroth against, to hate\",[8] to oduromai (\u1f40\u03b4\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) \"to lament, bewail\",[9][10] or even to ollumi (\u1f44\u03bb\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9) \"to perish, to be lost\".[11][12] Homer relates it to various forms of this verb in references and puns.In Book 19 of the Odyssey, where Odysseus' early childhood is recounted, Euryclea asks the boy's grandfather Autolycus to name him.Euryclea seems to suggest a name like Polyaretos, \"for he has much been prayed for\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2)  but Autolycus \"apparently in a sardonic mood\" decided to give the child another name commemorative of \"his own experience in

Dal\u00ed received his formal education in fine arts in Madrid.Influenced by Impressionism and the Renaissance masters from a young age he became increasingly attracted to Cubism and avant-garde movements.[2] He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents.His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings.Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the Spanish Civil War (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940

classicism, mysticism, and recent scientific developments.[3].Dal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists.He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism.Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships.To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior often drew more attention than his

The study of the humanities was a key part of the secular curriculum in universities at the time.Today, the humanities are more frequently defined as any fields of study outside of natural sciences, social sciences, formal sciences (like mathematics), and applied sciences (or professional training).[1] They use methods that are primarily critical, or speculative, and have a significant historical element[2]\u2014as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of science.[2].The humanities include the studies of foreign languages, history, philosophy, language arts (literature, writing, oratory, rhetoric, poetry, etc.), performing arts (theater, music, dance, etc.), and visual arts (painting, sculpture, photography, filmmaking, etc.)..Some definitions of the humanities encompass law and religion due to their shared characteristics, such as the study of language and culture.[3]However, these definitions are not universally accepted, as law and religion are often considered professional subjects rather than humanities subjects.Professional subjects, like some social sciences, are sometimes classified as being part of both the liberal arts and professional development education, whereas humanities subjects are generally confined to the traditional liberal arts education.Although anthropology, archaeology, linguistics, psychology, and sociology share some similarities with the humanities, these are widely considered social sciences.Similarly, disciplines such as finance, business administration, political science, economics, and global studies have closer ties to the social sciences rather than the humanities..Scholars in the humanities are called humanities scholars or sometimes humanists.[4] The term humanist also describes the philosophical position of humanism, which antihumanist scholars in the humanities reject.Renaissance scholars and artists are also known as humanists.Some secondary schools offer humanities classes usually

Christmas tree.President Franklin Pierce is said to have had the first indoor Christmas tree at the White House during the 1850s,[1] variously reported as 1853[2] or 1856.[3] More credible sources state that it was, in fact, President Benjamin Harrison's who had the first indoor tree (either in 1888,[4] 1889,[5][6] or 1891[1]).First Lady Caroline Harrison helped decorate the tree, which was installed in the second floor oval parlor, today's Yellow Oval Room.[5] There is an 1880 reference to President John Tyler in the 1840s, hosting a children's party at which there was a Christmas tree with gifts.[7].Following the Harrison administration indoor trees were not always used at the White House.First Lady Lou Henry Hoover began the tradition of presidential wives decorating the White House tree with the first \"official\" White House Christmas tree in 1929.[5] In 1961, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy began the tradition of selecting a theme for the White House Christmas tree by decorating with a Nutcracker motif.[8].As stated, there were years where no indoor White House Christmas tree was installed at all.It is verifiable that there was no Christmas tree in the White House in 1902,[9] 1904,[10] 1907,[11] and 1922.[12] The lack of a tree in 1902 was due to the fact that President Theodore Roosevelt had not ordered one by December 23.[9].Additionally, other presidents never displayed a tree in the White House.First U.S.President George Washington held office at a time when there was no White House, thus it is impossible for him to have displayed a tree there.[13] There is no evidence that Abraham Lincoln ever displayed a Christmas tree in the White House.[14] In 1922, First Lady Florence Harding's illness led to a more subdued Christmas celebration at the

information about the world through the detection of stimuli.Although in some cultures five human senses were traditionally identified as such (namely sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing), many more are now recognized.[1] Senses used by non-human organisms are even greater in variety and number.During sensation, sense organs collect various stimuli (such as a sound or smell) for transduction, meaning transformation into a form that can be understood by the brain.Sensation and perception are fundamental to nearly every aspect of an organism's cognition, behavior and thought..In organisms, a sensory organ consists of a group of interrelated sensory cells that respond to a specific type of physical stimulus.Via cranial and spinal nerves (nerves of the Central and Peripheral nervous systems that relay sensory information to and from the brain and body), the different types of sensory receptor cells (such as mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors, chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors) in sensory organs transduct sensory information from these organs towards the central nervous system, finally arriving at the sensory cortices in the brain, where sensory signals are processed and interpreted (perceived)..Sensory systems, or senses, are often divided into external (exteroception) and internal (interoception) sensory systems.Human external senses are based on the sensory organs of the eyes, ears, skin, nose, and mouth.Internal sensation detects stimuli from internal organs and tissues.Internal senses possessed by humans include the vestibular system (sense of balance) sensed by the inner ear, as well as others such as spatial orientation, proprioception (body position) and nociception (pain).Further internal senses lead to signals such as hunger, thirst, suffocation, and nausea, or different involuntary behaviors, such as vomiting.[2][3][4] Some animals are able to detect electrical and magnetic fields, air moisture, or polarized light, while others sense and perceive through alternative systems, such as echolocation.Sensory modalities or sub modalities are different ways sensory information is encoded or transduced.\nQ: how does taste differ

fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax or prosoma, and the opisthosoma, or abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel.However, as there is currently neither paleontological nor embryological evidence that spiders ever had a separate thorax-like division, there exists an argument against the validity of the term cephalothorax, which means fused cephalon (head) and the thorax.Similarly, arguments can be formed against use of the term abdomen, as the opisthosoma of all spiders contains a heart and respiratory organs, organs atypical of an abdomen.[7].Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae.In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax.Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure..Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of glands.Spider webs vary widely in size, shape and the amount of sticky thread used.It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the

hearing voices), delusions and disorganized thinking.[7] Other symptoms include social withdrawal and flat affect.[5] Symptoms typically develop gradually, begin during young adulthood, and in many cases are never resolved.[3][7] There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a psychiatric history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.[7] For a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the described symptoms need to have been present for at least six months (according to the DSM-5) or one month (according to the ICD-11).[7][15] Many people with schizophrenia have other mental disorders, especially substance use disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder.[7].About 0.3% to 0.7% of people are diagnosed with schizophrenia during their lifetime.[16] In 2017, there were an estimated 1.1million new cases and in 2022 a total of 24 million cases globally.[2][17] Males are more often affected and on average have an earlier onset than females.[2] The causes of schizophrenia may include genetic and environmental factors.[5] Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants.[18] Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, childhood adversity, cannabis use during adolescence, infections, the age of a person's mother or father, and poor nutrition during pregnancy.[5][19].About half of those diagnosed with schizophrenia will have a significant improvement over the long term with no further relapses, and a small proportion of these will recover completely.[7][20] The other half will have a lifelong impairment.[21] In severe cases, people may be admitted to hospitals.[20] Social problems such as long-term unemployment, poverty, homelessness, exploitation and victimization are commonly correlated with schizophrenia.[22][23] Compared to the general population, people with schizophrenia have a higher suicide rate (about 5% overall) and more physical health problems,[24][25] leading to an average decrease in life expectancy by 20[10] to 28 years.[11] In 2015, an estimated 17,000 deaths were linked to schizophrenia.[13].The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counseling, job training and social rehabilitation.[5] Up to a third of people do not respond to initial antipsychotics, in which case clozapine may be used.[26] In a network comparative meta-analysis of 15 antipsychotic drugs, clozapine was significantly more effective than all other drugs, although clozapine's heavily multimodal action may cause more side effects.[27] In situations where doctors judge that there is a risk of harm to self or others, they may impose short involuntary hospitalization.[28] Long-term hospitalization is used on a small number of people with severe schizophrenia.[29] In some countries where supportive services are limited or unavailable, long-term hospital stays are more common.[30].Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood and behavior.[31] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms.[3][32] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms.These may be present in any of the different psychoses and are often transient, making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic.Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[33][34].Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia.They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[33] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[35] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices), but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell and touch.[36] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[35] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[37] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature.Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as others can hear one's thoughts to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[38] Thought disorders can include thought blocking and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps linked to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7].Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes.The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect \u2013 showing flat expressions (monotone) or little emotion; alogia \u2013 a poverty of speech; anhedonia \u2013 an inability to feel pleasure; asociality \u2013 the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition \u2013 a lack of motivation and apathy.[39][40] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[41][42] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[42] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[39][43] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[44] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[45].\nQ: how is schizophrenia diagnosed?\nReasoning: Schizophrenia

primary goal was to train the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key government institutions; it gradually took part in the broader war in Afghanistan against the Taliban insurgency..ISAF's initial mandate was to secure the Afghan capital of Kabul and its surrounding area against opposition forces to facilitate the formation of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai.[4] In 2003, NATO took command of the mission at the request of the UN and Afghan government, marking its first deployment outside Europe and North America.Shortly thereafter, the UN Security Council expanded ISAF's mission to provide and maintain security beyond the capital region.[5] ISAF incrementally broadened its operations in four stages, and by 2006 took responsibility for the entire country; ISAF subsequently engaged in more intensive combat in southern and eastern Afghanistan.[6].At its peak between 2010 and 2012, ISAF had 400 military bases throughout Afghanistan (compared to 300 for the ANSF)[7] and roughly 130,000 troops.A total of 42 countries contributed troops to ISAF, including all 30 members of NATO.Personnel

"Context: Cocaine (from French: coca\u00efne, from Spanish: coca, ultimately from Quechua: k\u00faka)[14] is a tropane alkaloid that acts as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant.As an extract, it is mainly used recreationally, and often illegally for its euphoric and rewarding effects.It is also used in medicine by Indigenous South Americans for various purposes and rarely, but more formally as a local anaesthetic by medical practitioners in more developed countries.It is primarily obtained from the leaves of two Coca species native to South America: Erythroxylum coca and E.novogranatense.[15][16] After extraction from the plant, and further processing into cocaine hydrochloride (powdered cocaine), the drug is administered by being either snorted, applied topically to the mouth, or dissolved and injected into a vein.It can also then be turned into free base form (typically crack cocaine), in which it can be heated until sublimated and then the vapours can be inhaled.[12].Cocaine stimulates the reward pathway in the brain.[16] Mental effects may include an intense feeling of happiness, sexual arousal, loss of contact with reality, or agitation.[12] Physical effects may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and dilated pupils.[12] High doses can result in high blood pressure or high body temperature.[17] Onset of effects can begin within seconds to minutes of use, depending on method of delivery, and can last between five and ninety minutes.[12] As cocaine also has numbing and blood vessel constriction properties, it is occasionally used during surgery on the throat or inside of the nose to control pain, bleeding, and vocal cord spasm.[18].Cocaine crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier via a proton-coupled organic cation antiporter[19][20] and (to a lesser extent) via passive diffusion across cell membranes.[21] Cocaine blocks the dopamine transporter,[22] inhibiting reuptake of dopamine from the synaptic cleft into the pre-synaptic axon terminal; the higher dopamine levels in the synaptic cleft increase dopamine receptor activation in the post-synaptic neuron,[23][24] causing euphoria and arousal.[25] Cocaine also blocks the serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter, inhibiting reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft into the pre-synaptic axon terminal and increasing activation of serotonin receptors and norepinephrine receptors in the post-synaptic neuron, contributing to the mental and physical effects of cocaine exposure.[6].A single dose of cocaine induces tolerance to the drug's effects.[26] Repeated use is likely to result in addiction.Addicts who abstain from cocaine may experience craving and drug withdrawal symptoms, with depression, decreased libido, decreased ability to feel pleasure, and fatigue being most common.[16] Use of cocaine increases the overall risk of death, and intravenous use potentially increases the risk of trauma and infectious diseases such as blood infections and HIV through the use of shared paraphernalia for use.It also increases risk of stroke, heart attack, cardiac arrhythmia, lung injury (when smoked), and sudden cardiac death.[16][27] Illicitly sold cocaine can be adulterated with fentanyl, local anesthetics, levamisole, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar, which can result in additional toxicity.[28][29] In 2017, the Global Burden of Disease study found that cocaine use caused around 7,300 deaths annually.[30].Coca leaves have been used by Andean civilizations since ancient times.[28] In ancient Wari culture,[31] Incan culture, and through modern successor indigenous cultures of the Andes mountains, coca leaves are chewed, taken orally in the form of a tea, or alternatively, prepared in a sachet wrapped around alkaline burnt ashes, and held in the mouth against the inner cheek; it has traditionally been used to combat the effects of cold, hunger, and altitude sickness.[32][33] Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860.[16].\nQ: what happens to the chemical composition of cocaine when you add it to alcohol\nReasoning: Cocaine (benzoylmethylecgonine) ( INN ) is a crystalline

its resting, equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position.When released, the restoring force acting on the pendulum's mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth.The time for one complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period.The period depends on the length of the pendulum and also to a slight degree on the amplitude, the width of the pendulum's swing..The regular motion of pendulums was used for timekeeping and was the world's most accurate timekeeping technology until the 1930s.[2] The pendulum clock invented by Christiaan Huygens in 1656 became the world's standard timekeeper, used in homes and offices for 270 years, and achieved accuracy of about one second per year before it was superseded as a time standard by the quartz clock in the 1930s.Pendulums are also used in scientific instruments such as accelerometers and seismometers.Historically they were used as gravimeters to measure the acceleration of gravity in geo-physical surveys, and even as a standard of length.The word pendulum is Neo-Latin, from the Latin pendulus, meaning hanging.[3].The simple gravity pendulum[4] is an idealized mathematical model of a pendulum.[5][6][7] This is a weight (or bob) on the end of a massless cord suspended from a pivot, without friction.When given an initial push, it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude.Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag, so the amplitude of their swings declines..The period of swing of a simple gravity pendulum depends on its length, the local strength of gravity, and to a small extent on the maximum angle that the pendulum swings away from vertical, \u03b80,

stratosphere.Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[4] When used without qualification, \"weather\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth..Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another.These differences can occur due to the Sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude.The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream.Weather systems in the middle latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow.Because Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year.On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range \u00b140\u00b0C (\u221240\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F) annually.Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change..Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant.Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location.\nQ: how does weather happen\nReasoning: Thunderstorm near Garajau, Madeira"}, {"question_id": "Q939", "question": "how

has been convened for the purpose of achieving a common goal through verbal interaction, such as sharing information or reaching agreement.[1] Meetings may occur face-to-face or virtually, as mediated by communications technology, such as a telephone conference call, a skyped conference call or a videoconference.One Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a meeting as \"an act or process of coming together\" - for example \"as [...] an assembly for a common purpose [...]\".[2].Meeting planners and other meeting professionals may use the term \"meeting\" to denote an event booked at a hotel, convention center or any other venue dedicated to such gatherings.[1][3].Anthropologist Helen B.Schwartzman defines a meeting as \"a communicative event involving three or more people who agree to assemble for a purpose ostensibly related to the functioning of an organization or group.\"[4] For her, meetings are characterized by \"multiparty talk that is episodic in nature, and participants either develop or use specific conventions for regulating this talk.\"[4].The term \"meeting\" may refer to a lecture (one presentation), seminar (typically several presentations, small audience, one day), conference (mid-size, one or more days), congress (large, several days), exhibition or trade show (with staffed stands being visited by passers-by), workshop (smaller, with active participants),

are required to determine a winner, or the game must be stopped before nine innings have been played, e.g.due to inclement weather.The term \"official game\" is mainly used in the context of a game that is stopped before nine innings have been played, though it has been used for other promotional purposes..A game that is stopped (\"called\" in the MLB rulebook) by the umpires before the regulation number of innings have been played may be considered an official game if five innings have been played (4+1\u20442 innings if the home team is in the lead), unless the game meets one of the conditions for a suspended game.An official game that is stopped in this way is ended at the point of stoppage and statistics are added to each team's totals, while a suspended game is resumed from the point of stoppage at a later time.A game that is stopped before five innings have been played is considered \"no game\" unless it can be considered a suspended game; statistics accumulated before the stoppage are not counted and replay of the game is subject to the league rules..In the case of inclement weather, any game which has reached this point may be stopped and shortened as needed, with the result being final, and all records and statistics counted.A game which has not reached this point before being stopped is either considered a suspended game (to be continued at a later date from the point of stoppage), or is simply canceled and replayed from the start.(This depends on the rules of each individual league.) In either case, no statistics are counted until the game becomes official..Since most professional baseball games are nine innings long, the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game.If the visiting team is leading, or the game is tied, the end of the fifth inning marks this point.If the home team (which bats last) is already ahead in the score, and theoretically would not

a wireless electronic telephony device, such as a radio telephone or a mobile telephone, or to other devices for data transmission via the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or other public and private networks..A telephone number serves as an address for switching telephone calls using a system of destination code routing.[1]  Telephone numbers are entered or dialed by a calling party on the originating telephone set, which transmits the sequence of digits in the process of signaling to a telephone exchange.The exchange completes the call either to another locally connected subscriber or via the PSTN to the called party.Telephone numbers are assigned within the framework of a national or regional telephone numbering plan to subscribers by telephone service operators, which may be commercial entities, state-controlled administrations, or other telecommunication industry associations..Telephone numbers were first used in 1879 in Lowell, Massachusetts, when they replaced the request for subscriber names by callers connecting to the switchboard operator.[2] Over the course of telephone history, telephone numbers had various lengths and formats and even included most letters of the alphabet in leading positions when telephone exchange names were in common use until the 1960s..Telephone numbers are often dialed in conjunction with other signaling code sequences, such as vertical service codes, to invoke special telephone service features.[3][4].When telephone numbers were first used they were very short, from one to three digits, and were communicated orally to a switchboard operator when initiating a call.As telephone systems have grown and interconnected to encompass worldwide communication, telephone numbers have become longer.In addition to telephones, they have been used to access other devices, such as computer modems, pagers, and fax machines.With landlines, modems and pagers falling out of use in favor of all-digital always-connected broadband Internet and mobile phones, telephone numbers are now often used by data-only cellular devices, such as some tablet computers, digital televisions, video game controllers, and mobile

radiation.A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive.Three of the most common types of decay are alpha, beta, and gamma decay.The weak force is the mechanism that is responsible for beta decay, while the other two are governed by the electromagnetism and nuclear force.[1].Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e.random) process at the level of single atoms.According to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay, regardless of how long the atom has existed.[2][3][4] However, for a significant number of identical atoms, the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as half-life.The half-lives of radioactive atoms have a huge range; from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe..The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide (or parent radioisotope[note 1]), and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide.Except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state, the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of protons or neutrons (or both).When the number of protons changes, an atom of a different chemical

processing is one of the initial steps of the glass-making process.The batch house simply houses the raw materials in large silos (fed by truck or railcar), and holds anywhere from 1\u20135 days of material.Some batch systems include material processing such as raw material screening/sieve, drying, or pre-heating (i.e.cullet).Whether automated or manual, the batch house measures, assembles, mixes, and delivers the glass raw material recipe (batch) via an array of chutes, conveyors, and scales to the furnace.The batch enters the furnace at the \"dog house\" or \"batch charger\".Different glass types, colours, desired quality, raw material purity/availability, and furnace design will affect the batch recipe..The hot end of a glassworks is where the molten glass is manufactured into

of the year[1] based on changes in weather, ecology, and the number of daylight hours in a given region.On Earth, seasons are the result of the axial parallelism of Earth's tilted orbit around the Sun.[2][3][4] In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations, and as such there are a number of both modern and historical cultures whose number of seasons varies..The Northern Hemisphere experiences most direct sunlight during May, June, and July, as the hemisphere faces the Sun.The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January.It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux.However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere..In temperate and sub-polar regions, four seasons based on the Gregorian calendar are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn (or fall), and winter.Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions which are not tied to any fixed calendar dates: prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, autumnal, and hibernal.Many tropical regions have two seasons: the rainy, wet, or monsoon season and the dry season.Some have a third cool, mild, or harmattan season.\"Seasons\" can also be dictated by the timing of important ecological events such as hurricane season, tornado season, and wildfire season.[citation needed] Some examples of historical importance are the ancient Egyptian seasons\u2014flood, growth, and low water\u2014which were previously defined by the former annual flooding of

congratulations for a happy and significant occasion or event..The word mazel comes from the Biblical Hebrew mazz\u0101l, meaning \"constellation\" or (in Mishnaic Hebrew) \"astrological sign\" and may be related to the root \u05e0-\u05d6-\u05dc meaning \"to flow down\".The phrase mazel tov first appears in Geonic Hebrew, where it means \"positive astrological sign\"  or simply \"good fortune.\"[1] The Medieval Hebrew chant siman tov u-mazel tov, yehe lanu ulkhol yisrael \"A good sign, a good omen! Let it happen for us and for all Israel\" was used to congratulate, and the phrase itself acquired a congratulatory usage in Yiddish and Hebrew by the early 19th century and was later incorporated into Modern Hebrew.The Yiddish and Ashkenazic pronunciation of mazel has the stress on the first syllable while the Modern Hebrew word mazal has the stress on the last syllable.Mazel-tov is also used as a personal name..The phrase \"mazel tov\" is recorded as entering into American English from Yiddish in 1862,[2] pronounced /\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0z\u0259lt\u0252v, -t\u0252f/ MAH-z\u0259l-TOV,

lucky\").[4] The word tov also entered Dutch as tof or toffe (\"nice\" or \"great\")[5] and German as t\u00f6fte or dufte.[6].Mazel tov is literally translated as \"good luck\" in its meaning as a description, not a wish.The implicit meaning is \"good luck has occurred\" or \"your fortune has been good\" and the expression is an acknowledgement of that fact.It is similar in usage to the word \"congratulations!\" and conveys roughly, \"I am pleased this good thing has happened to you!\"[citation needed] A common Hebrew phrase for wishing \"good luck\" is b'hatzlacha (\u05d1\u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\u05d7\u05d4), literally meaning \"with success\".[7].Throughout the Jewish world, including the diaspora, \"mazel tov!\" is a common Jewish expression at events such as a bar

that primarily affects the liver;[2] it is a type of viral hepatitis.[6] During the initial infection period, people often have mild or no symptoms.[1] Early symptoms can include fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin.[1] The virus persists in the liver, becoming chronic, in about 70% of those initially infected.[4] Early on, chronic infection typically has no symptoms.[1] Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis.[1] In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop serious complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach.[2].HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with injection drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions.[1][3] In regions where blood screening has been implemented, the risk of contracting HCV from a transfusion has dropped substantially to less than one per two million.[1] HCV may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth.[1] It is not spread through breast milk, food, water or casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.[4] It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.[7].Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or viral RNA.[1] In the United States, screening for HCV infection is recommended in all adults age 18 to 79 years old.[8].There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.[1][9] Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who inject drugs, testing donated blood, and treatment of people with chronic infection.[4][10] Chronic infection can be cured more than 95% of the time with antiviral medications such as sofosbuvir or simeprevir.[1][4] Peginterferon and ribavirin were earlier generation treatments that proved successful in <50% of cases and caused greater side effects.[4]:\u200a2015 version\u200a[11] While access to the newer treatments was expensive,  by 2022 prices had dropped dramatically in many countries (primarily low-income and lower-middle-income countries) due to the introduction of generic versions of  medicines.[4] Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant.[5] Hepatitis C is one of the leading reasons for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation.[5].An estimated 58 million people worldwide were infected with hepatitis C in 2019.Approximately 290,000 deaths from the virus, mainly from liver cancer and cirrhosis attributed to hepatitis C, also occurred in 2019.[12] The existence of hepatitis C \u2013 originally identifiable only as a type of non-A non-B hepatitis \u2013 was suggested in the 1970s and proven in 1989.[13] Hepatitis C infects only humans and chimpanzees.[14].Acute symptoms develop in some 20% of those infected.[4][1] When this occurs, it is generally 4\u201312 weeks following infection (but it may take from 2 weeks to 6 months for acute symptoms to appear).[1][4].Symptoms are generally mild and vague, and may include fatigue, nausea and vomiting, fever, muscle or joint pains, abdominal pain, decreased appetite and weight loss, jaundice (occurs in ~25% of those infected), dark urine, and clay-coloured stools.[1][15][16] Acute liver failure due to acute hepatitis C is exceedingly rare.[17] Symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of liver disease should prompt further tests and can thus help establish a diagnosis of hepatitis C infection early on.[16].Following the acute phase, the infection may resolve spontaneously in 10\u201350% of affected people; this occurs more frequently in young people and females.[15].About 70% of those exposed to the virus develop a chronic infection.[4] This is defined as the presence of detectable viral replication for at least six months.Though most experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few decades of a chronic infection,[18] chronic hepatitis C can be associated with fatigue[19] and mild cognitive problems.[20] After several years, chronic infection may cause cirrhosis or liver cancer.[5] The liver enzymes measured from blood samples are normal in 7\u201353%.[21] (Elevated levels indicate liver cells are being damaged by the virus or other disease).Late relapses after apparent cure have been reported, but these can be difficult to distinguish from reinfection.[21].\nQ: How Do You Get Hepatitis C\nReasoning: Hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting primarily the liver , caused by the

the eastern part of the state that existed before the first European American settlement.[12] Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later the Southwest Territory, before its admission to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796.It earned the nickname \"The Volunteer State\" early in its history due to a strong tradition of military service.[13] A slave state until the American Civil War, Tennessee was politically divided, with its western and middle parts supporting the Confederacy and the eastern region harboring pro-Union sentiment.As a result, Tennessee was the last state to secede and the first readmitted to the Union after the war.[14].During the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from a predominantly agrarian society to a more diversified economy.This was

destroyed..The energy in many of its forms may be used in natural processes, or to provide some service to society such as heating, refrigeration, lighting or performing mechanical work to operate machines.For example, to heat a home, the furnace burns fuel, whose chemical potential energy is converted into thermal energy, which is then transferred to the home's air to raise its temperature..Conversions to thermal energy from other forms of energy may occur with 100% efficiency.[2][self-published source?] Conversion among non-thermal forms of energy may occur with fairly high efficiency, though there is always some energy dissipated thermally due to friction and similar processes.Sometimes the efficiency is close to 100%, such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in a vacuum.This also applies to the opposite case; for example, an object in an elliptical orbit around another body converts its kinetic energy (speed) into gravitational potential energy (distance from the other object) as it moves away from its parent body.When it reaches the furthest point, it will reverse the process, accelerating and converting potential energy into kinetic.Since space is a near-vacuum, this process has close to 100% efficiency..Thermal energy is unique because it in most cases (willow) cannot be converted to other forms of

analysis[4]:\u200a3\u20135\u200a to develop a body of knowledge about social order and social change.[4]:\u200a32\u201340\u200a While some sociologists conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes and phenomenological method.Subject matter can range from micro-level analyses of society (i.e.of individual interaction and agency) to macro-level analyses (i.e.of social systems and social structure).[5].Traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, sexuality, gender, and deviance.As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects and institutions, such as health and the institution of medicine; economy; military; punishment and systems of control; the Internet; sociology of education; social capital; and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge..The range of social scientific methods has also expanded, as social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques.The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-20th century, especially, have led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophical approaches towards the analysis of society.Conversely, the turn of the 21st century has seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically, and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis.[6][7].Social research has influence throughout various industries and sectors of life, such as among politicians, policy makers, and legislators; educators; planners; administrators; developers; business magnates and managers; social workers; non-governmental organizations; and non-profit organizations, as well as individuals interested in resolving social issues in general.As such, there is often a great deal of crossover between social research, market research, and other statistical fields.[8].\nQ: how is sociology different from

reconquered by the Byzantine Empire, then colonised by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa) and, in the 13th century, by James I of Aragon..After the conquest of Mallorca, the city was loosely incorporated into the province of Tarraconensis by 123 BC; the Romans founded two new cities: Palma on the south of the island, and Pollentia in the northeast \u2013 on the site of a Phoenician settlement.Whilst Pollentia acted as a port to Roman cities on the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, Palma was the port used for destinations in Africa, such as Carthage, and Hispania, such as Saguntum,

archnemesis of the superhero Superman.[1].Lex Luthor was depicted as a narcissistic and egotistical mad scientist from the 1960s to the mid-1980s.Since the mid-late 1980s, he has more often been portrayed as the power-mad CEO of LexCorp.He wishes to rid the world of Superman, ostensibly because he views Superman as a threat to humanity, but in reality envies Superman's popularity and influence.[2] Given his high profile as a supervillain, however, he has often come into conflict with Batman and other superheroes in the DC Universe.[3] Lex Luthor is physically an ordinary human and has no natural superpowers, but is a genius with a high aptitude for business and politics and a deep command of science and technology.He occasionally wears his Warsuit, a suit of mechanized armor that gives him enhanced strength, flight, advanced weaponry, and other capabilities.While Lex is primarily depicted as a supervillain allied with other villains, such as Metallo, Parasite and Bizarro,

it.[4].The character was ranked 4th on IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time[5] and as the 8th Greatest Villain by Wizard on its 100 Greatest Villains of All Time list.[6] Luthor

resulting image wirelessly and conveniently.The first commercial phone with color camera was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210, released in Japan in May 1999.[1].Most camera phones are smaller and simpler than the separate digital cameras.In the smartphone era, the steady sales increase of camera phones caused point-and-shoot camera sales to peak about 2010 and decline thereafter.[2] The concurrent improvement of smartphone camera technology, and its other multifunctional benefits, have led to it gradually replacing compact point-and-shoot cameras.[3].Most modern smartphones only have a menu choice to start a camera application program and an on-screen button to activate the shutter.[4] Some also have a separate camera button, for quickness and convenience.A few such as the 2009 Samsung i8000 Omnia II have a two-level shutter button as in dedicated digital cameras.[5]  Some camera phones are designed to resemble separate low-end digital compact cameras in appearance and to some degree in features and picture quality, and are branded as both mobile phones and cameras\u2014an example being the 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom..The principal advantages of camera phones are cost

belief, the body and blood of Christ are present in the bread and wine that are consecrated during the Catholic eucharistic liturgy, generally known as the Mass.[2] The definition of the Eucharist in the 1983 Code of Canon Law as the sacrament where Christ himself \"is contained, offered, and received\" points to the three aspects of the Eucharist according to Catholic theology: the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, Holy Communion, and the holy sacrifice of the Mass.[3].The name \"Eucharist\" comes from the Greek word \"eucharistia\" which means \"thanksgiving\" and which refers to the accounts of the last supper in Matthew 26:26-28, Mark 14:22-24, Luke 22:19-20 and I Corinthians11:23-29, all of which narrate that Jesus \"gave thanks\" as he took the bread and the wine.[2].The term Mass refers to the act by which the sacrament of the Eucharist comes into being, while the term Holy Communion refers to the act by which the Eucharist is received.[2].Blessed Sacrament is a devotional term used in the Catholic Church to refer to the Eucharistic species (consecrated sacramental bread and wine) .[4] Consecrated hosts are kept in a tabernacle after Mass, so that the Blessed Sacrament can be brought to the sick and dying outside the time of Mass.[5] This makes possible also the practice of eucharistic adoration.[5].Certain passages of the Old Testament are said to  refer to remote preparations for, or prefigurations of, the institution of the Holy Eucharist.These are the passages regarding the offering by Melchizedek (Gen.14:18-20),[6] the sacrifice of the Covenant on

fiction that can typically be read in a single sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a single effect or mood.The short story is one of the oldest types of literature and has existed in the form of legends, mythic tales, folk tales, fairy tales, tall tales, fables and anecdotes in various ancient communities around the world.The modern short story developed in the early 19th century.[1].The short story is a crafted form in its own right.Short stories make use of plot, resonance and other dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a lesser degree.While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or novella/short novel, authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.[citation needed] The short story is sometimes referred to as a genre.[2].Determining what exactly defines a short story has been recurrently problematic.[3] A classic definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in Edgar Allan Poe's essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\" (1846).[4] H.G.Wells described the purpose of the short story as \"The jolly art, of making something very bright and moving; it may be horrible or pathetic or funny or profoundly illuminating, having only this essential, that it should take from fifteen to fifty minutes to read aloud.\"[5] According to William Faulkner, a short story is character-driven and a writer's job is to \"...trot along behind him with a paper and pencil trying to keep up long enough to put down what he says and does.\"[6].Some authors have argued that a short story must have a strict form.Somerset Maugham thought that the short story \"must have a definite design, which includes a point of departure, a climax and a point of test; in other words, it must have a plot\".[5] Hugh Walpole had a similar view: \"A story should be a story; a record of things happening full of incidents, swift movements, unexpected development, leading through suspense to a climax and a satisfying denouement.\"[5].This view of the short story as a finished product of art is however opposed by Anton Chekov, who thought that a story should have neither a beginning nor an end.It should just be a \"slice of life\", presented suggestively.\nQ: how many words are in a short story\nReasoning: A short story is

largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70cm (16 to 28in), and a body weight of 5 to 26kg (11 to 57lb).Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur, which insulates it

usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebrates..The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests, but due to their adaptability, they have extended their range to mountainous areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas, where some homeowners consider them to be pests.As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the

as an immigrant group from the Aegean that settled in Canaan circa 1175 BC, during the Late Bronze Age collapse.Over time, they gradually assimilated elements of the indigenous Semitic Levantine societies while preserving their own unique culture.[1] In 604 BC, the Philistine polity, after having already been subjugated for centuries by the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911\u2013605 BC), was finally destroyed by King Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.[2] After becoming part of his empire and its successor, the Persian Empire, the Philistines lost their distinct ethnic identity and disappeared as a people from the historical and archaeological record by the late 5th century BC.[3].The Philistines are known for their biblical conflict with the Canaanite peoples of the region, in particular the Israelites.Though the primary source of information about the Philistines is the Hebrew Bible, they are first attested to in reliefs at the Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu, in which they are called Peleset[a] (accepted as cognate with Hebrew Peleshet);[4] the parallel Assyrian term is Palastu,[b] Pili\u0161ti,[c] or Pilistu.[d][5] They also left behind a distinctive material culture.[1].The English term Philistine comes from Old French Philistin; from Classical Latin Philistinus; from Late Greek Philistinoi; ultimately from Hebrew P\u0259li\u0161t\u012b (\u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9; plural P\u0259li\u0161t\u012bm, \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd), meaning 'people of P\u0259le\u0161e\u1e6f (\u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05ea)'; and there are cognates in Akkadian Palastu and Egyptian Palusata;[6] the term Palestine has the same derivation.[7] The native Philistine endonym is unknown..The Hebrew term P\u0259li\u0161t\u012bm occurs 286 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible (of which 152 times are in 1 Samuel).It also appears in the Samaritan Pentateuch.[8] In the Greek version of the Bible, called Septuagint, the equivalent term Phulistie\u00edm (\u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b5\u03af\u03bc) occurs 12 times, again in the Pentateuch.[9].In secondary literature, \"Philistia\" is further mentioned in the Aramaic Visions of Amram (4Q543-7), which is dated \"prior to Antiochus IV and the Hasmonean revolt,\" possibly to the time of High Priest of Israel Onias II; Jubilees 46:1-47:1 might have used Amram as a source.[10].Outside of pre-Maccabean Israelite religious literature, evidence for the name and the origins of the Philistines is less abundant and less consistent.In the remainder of the Hebrew Bible, ha-P\u0259li\u0161t\u012bm is attested at Qumran for 2 Samuel 5:17.[11] In the Septuagint, however, 269 references instead use the term allophylos ('of another tribe').[12].During the Late Bronze Age collapse, an apparent confederation of seafarers known as the Sea Peoples are recorded as attacking ancient Egypt and other Eastern Mediterranean civilizations, while the Bronze Age collapse also saw large invasions, mass migrations and upheavals in Western Asia, Asia Minor, Caucasus, East Mediterranean and Balkans with only the powerful states of Assyria and Elam unaffected.[13] While their exact origins are a mystery, and probably diverse, it is generally agreed that the Sea Peoples had origins in the greater Southern European and West Asian area, including western Asia Minor, the Aegean, and the islands of the East Mediterranean.[14] Egypt, in particular, repelled numerous attempted invasions from the Sea Peoples, most famously at the Battle of the Delta (c.\u20091175BC),[15] where the pharaoh Ramesses III defeated a massive invasion force which had already plundered Hattusa, Carchemish, Cyprus, and the Southern Levant.\nQ: where in the bible that palestine have no land in jerusalem\nReasoning: The Philistine cities of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon,

known as equity or the net assets or the net worth or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation, net worth must equal assets minus liabilities.[3].Another way to look at the balance sheet equation is that total assets equals liabilities plus owner's equity.Looking at the equation in this way shows how assets were financed: either by borrowing money (liability) or by using the owner's money (owner's or shareholders' equity).Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections

member of the First Triumvirate, Caesar led the Roman armies in the Gallic Wars before defeating his political rival Pompey in a civil war, and subsequently became dictator from 49 BC until his assassination in 44 BC.He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire..In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, an informal political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years.Their attempts to amass political power were opposed by many in the Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the private support of Cicero.Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a string of military victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51BC, which greatly extended Roman territory.During this time he both invaded Britain and built a bridge across the river Rhine.These achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53BC.With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome.In 49 BC, Caesar openly defied the Senate's authority by crossing the Rubicon and marching towards Rome at the head of an army.[3] This began Caesar's civil war, which he won, leaving him in a position of near-unchallenged power and influence in 45 BC..After assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reform, including the creation of the

government, business and education.[10] Furthermore, the national anthem, constitution and pledge are written in English.Almost all mass media transmit information in English.[11] English became the official language when Nigeria was created from diverse national groups by the British Empire.[11] Despite decolonisation, Nigeria chose to make English the official language to promote national cultural unity[12] and so not to favour any particular native language.[11].Despite its status, English is not widely spoken in rural areas.[13] Many Nigerians struggle with English, evidenced by the 60 percent fail rate of the WASSCE in English (May/June 2015), an important exam certificate.[10] Nevertheless, many Nigerians hold negative social attitudes towards the country's native languages, combining to lead to the neglect of Nigeria's many native languages.As such, there are fears from prominent linguists that Nigerian native languages are endangered and face eventual extinction.[11].Many Nigerians speak Nigerian Pidgin, a creole language based on English, which has replaced the native language for many Nigerians.Pidgin is a popular social and cultural language.[11] It has become popular in the mass media and in political slogans.[14][15][11] According to a 2012 study, the replacement of native local languages with Pidgin is inevitable in the areas

"label": 0, "input": "Context: In physiology, the somatosensory system is the network of neural structures in the brain and body that produce the perception of touch (haptic perception), as well as temperature (thermoception), body position (proprioception), and pain.[1] It is a subset of the sensory nervous system, which also represents visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli..Somatosensation begins when mechano- and thermosensitive structures in the skin or internal organs sense physical stimuli such as pressure on the skin (see mechanotransduction, nociception).Activation of these structures, or receptors, leads to activation of peripheral sensory neurons that convey signals to the spinal cord as patterns of action potentials.Sensory information is then processed locally in the spinal cord to drive reflexes, and is also conveyed to the brain for conscious perception of touch and proprioception.Note, somatosensory information from the face and head enters the brain through peripheral sensory neurons in the cranial nerves, such as the trigeminal nerve..The neural pathways that go to the brain are structured such that information about the location of the physical stimulus is preserved.In this way, neighboring neurons in the somatosensory cerebral cortex in the brain represent nearby locations on the skin or in the body, creating a map, also called a cortical homunculus..The four mechanoreceptors in the skin  each respond to different stimuli for short or long periods..Merkel cell nerve endings are found in the basal epidermis and hair follicles; they react to low vibrations (5\u201315Hz) and deep static touch such as shapes and edges.Due to having a small receptive field (extremely detailed information), they are used in areas like fingertips the most; they are not covered (shelled) and thus respond to pressures over long periods..Tactile corpuscles react to moderate vibration (10\u201350Hz) and light touch.They are located in the dermal papillae; due to their reactivity, they are primarily located in fingertips and lips.\nQ: Who discovered the sense of touch?\nReasoning: Touch is a crucial means of receiving

specimens of M.acuminata have been found dating to 20 million years ago, and fossils of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date to 95 million years ago.[3] Another aspect of Magnolia considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals.Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near the base of the flowering plant lineage, such as Amborella and Nymphaea (as well as with many more recently derived plants, such as Lilium)..Magnolias are spreading evergreen or deciduous trees or shrubs characterised by large fragrant flowers, which may be bowl-shaped or star-shaped, in shades of white, pink, purple, green, or yellow.In deciduous species, the blooms often appear before the leaves in spring.Cone-like fruits are often produced in the autumn.[4].As with all Magnoliaceae, the perianth is

pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) greater than 3 Wood units..The cause is often unknown.[1] Risk factors include a family history, prior pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs), HIV/AIDS, sickle cell disease, cocaine use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea, living at high altitudes, and problems with the mitral valve.[5][4] The underlying mechanism typically involves inflammation and subsequent remodeling of the arteries in the lungs.[5] Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes.[1].As of 2022[update] there was no cure for pulmonary hypertension,[6] although research to find a cure is ongoing.Treatment depends on the type of disease.[6] A number of supportive measures such as oxygen therapy, diuretics, and medications to inhibit blood clotting may be used.[1] Medications specifically used to treat pulmonary hypertension include epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan, and sildenafil, tadalafil, selexipag, riociguat.[1] Lung transplantation may be an option in severe cases.[6].The frequency of occurrence is estimated at 1,000 new cases per year in the United States.[4][2] Females are more

that each state approves and regulates in which case they are designed using a mortality table and mainly guaranteed by a life insurer.There are many different varieties of annuities sold by carriers.In a typical scenario, an investor (usually the annuitant) will make a single cash premium to own an annuity.After the policy is issued the owner may elect to annuitize the contract (start receiving payments) for a chosen period of time (e.g., 5, 10, 20 years, a lifetime).This process is called annuitization and can also provide a predictable, guaranteed stream of future income during retirement until the death of the annuitant (or joint annuitants).Alternatively, an investor can defer annuitizing their contract to get larger payments later, hedge long-term care cost increases, or maximize a lump sum death benefit for a named beneficiary.[1].Although annuities have existed in their present form only for a few decades, the idea of paying out a stream of income to an individual

fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions.Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power plants.Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in some space probes such as Voyager 2.Generating electricity from fusion power remains the focus of international research..Most nuclear power plants use thermal reactors with enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle.Fuel is removed when the percentage of neutron absorbing atoms becomes so large that a chain reaction can no longer be sustained, typically three years.It is then cooled for several years in on-site spent fuel pools before being transferred to long term storage.The spent fuel, though low in volume, is high-level radioactive waste.While its radioactivity decreases exponentially it must be isolated from the biosphere for hundreds of thousands of years, though newer technologies (like fast reactors) have the potential to reduce this significantly.Because the spent fuel is still mostly fissionable material, some countries (e.g.France and Russia) reprocess their spent fuel by extracting fissile and fertile elements for fabrication in new fuel, although this process is more expensive than producing new fuel from mined uranium.\nQ: Who

War", "answer": "Photograph of the Berlin Wall taken from the West side.", "label": 0, "input": "Context: The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc.The term cold war is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported opposing sides in major regional conflicts known as proxy wars.The conflict was based on the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their roles as the Allies of World War II that led to victory against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945.[2] Aside from the nuclear arms race and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means, such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, sports diplomacy, and technological competitions like the Space Race.The Cold War began shortly after the end of World War II, started a gradual winding down with the Sino-Soviet split between the Soviets and the People's Republic of China in 1961, and ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991..The Western Bloc was led by the United States, as well as a number of other First World nations that were generally liberal democratic but tied to a network of often authoritarian, Third World states, most of which were the European powers' former colonies.[3][B] The Eastern Bloc was led by the Soviet Union and its Communist Party, which had an influence across the Second World and was also tied to a network of authoritarian states.The Soviet Union had a command economy and installed similarly Communist regimes in its satellite states.United States involvement in regime change during the Cold War included support for anti-communist and right-wing dictatorships, governments, and uprisings across the world, while Soviet involvement in regime change included the funding left-wing parties, wars of national liberation and revolutions around the world.As nearly all the colonial states underwent decolonization and achieved independence in the period from 1945 to 1960, many became Third World battlefields in the Cold War..The first phase of the Cold War began shortly after the end of World War II in 1945.The United States and its Western European allies sought to strengthen their bonds and used the policy of containment against Soviet influence; they accomplished this most notably through the formation of NATO, which was essentially a defensive agreement in 1949.The Soviet Union countered with the Warsaw Pact in 1955, which had similar results with the Eastern Bloc.As by that time the Soviet Union already had an armed presence and political domination all over its eastern satellite states, the pact has been long considered superfluous.[4][5] Although nominally a defensive alliance, the Warsaw Pact's primary function was to safeguard Soviet hegemony over its Eastern European satellites, with the pact's only direct military actions having been the invasions of its own member states to keep them from breaking away;[6] in the 1960s, the pact evolved into a multilateral alliance, in which the non-Soviet Warsaw Pact members gained significant scope to pursue their own interests.\nQ: when did the cold war

stipulated how personally identifiable information maintained by the healthcare and healthcare insurance industries should be protected from fraud and theft,[4] and addressed some limitations on healthcare insurance coverage.It generally prohibits healthcare providers and healthcare businesses, called covered entities, from disclosing protected information to anyone other than a patient and the patient's authorized representatives without their consent.With limited exceptions, it does not restrict patients from receiving information about themselves.[5] It does not prohibit patients from voluntarily sharing their health information however they choose, nor does it require confidentiality where a patient discloses medical information to family members, friends, or other individuals not a part of a covered entity..The act consists of five titles.Title I of HIPAA protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs.[6] Title II of HIPAA, known as the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers.[7] Title III sets guidelines for pre-tax medical spending accounts, Title IV sets guidelines for group health plans, and Title V governs company-owned life insurance policies..There are five sections to the act, known as titles..Title I of HIPAA regulates the availability and breadth of group health plans and certain individual health insurance policies.It amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code.Furthermore, Title I addresses the issue of \"job lock\" which is the inability for an employee to leave their job because they would lose their health coverage.[8] To combat the job lock issue, the Title protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families if they lose or change their jobs.[9].Title I requires the coverage of and also limits restrictions that a group health plan can place on benefits for pre-existing conditions.Group health plans may refuse to provide benefits in relation to pre-existing conditions for either 12 months following enrolment in the plan or 18 months in the case of late enrolment.[10]  Title I allows individuals to reduce the exclusion period by the amount of time that they have had \"creditable coverage\" before enrolling in the plan and after any \"significant breaks\" in coverage.[11] \"Creditable coverage\" is defined quite broadly and includes nearly all group and individual health plans, Medicare, and Medicaid.[12] A \"significant break\" in coverage is defined as any 63-day period without any creditable coverage.[13] Along with an exception, it allows employers to tie premiums or co-payments to tobacco use, or body mass index..Title I[14] also requires insurers to issue policies without

the process of removing heat from an enclosed space to achieve a more comfortable interior environment (sometimes referred to as 'comfort cooling') and in some cases also strictly controlling the humidity of internal air.Air conditioning can be achieved using a mechanical 'air conditioner' or alternatively a variety of other methods, including passive cooling and ventilative cooling.Air conditioning is a member of a family of systems and techniques that provide heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC).Heat pumps are similar in many ways to air conditioners, but use a reversing valve to allow them both to heat and to cool an enclosed space..Air conditioners, which typically use vapor-compression refrigeration, range in size from small units used within vehicles or single rooms to massive units that can cool large buildings.[2] Air source heat pumps, which can be used for heating as well as cooling, are becoming increasingly common in cooler climates..According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), as of 2018, 1.6 billion air conditioning units were installed, which accounted for an estimated 20% of electricity usage in buildings globally with the number expected to grow to 5.6 billion by 2050.[3] The United Nations called for the technology to be made more sustainable to mitigate climate change and for the use of alternatives, like passive cooling, evaporative cooling, selective shading, windcatchers, and better thermal insulation.CFC and HCFC refrigerants such as R-12 and R-22, respectively, used within air conditioners have caused damage to the ozone layer,[4] and HFC refrigerants such as R-410a and R-404a, which were designed to replace CFCs and HCFCs, are instead exacerbating climate change.[5] Both issues happen due to the venting of refrigerant to the atmosphere, such as during repairs.HFO refrigerants, used in some if not most new equipment, solve both issues with an ozone damage potential (ODP) of zero and a much lower global warming potential (GWP) in the single or double digits vs.the three or four digits of HFCs.[6].Air conditioning dates back to prehistory.Ancient Egyptian buildings used a wide variety of passive air-conditioning techniques.[7] These became widespread from the Iberian Peninsula through North Africa, the Middle East, and Northern India.[8].Passive techniques remained widespread until the 20th century, when they fell out of fashion, replaced by powered air conditioning.\nQ: what year was air conditioning created\nReasoning: A typical home air conditioning window unit."}, {"question_id":

and verse divisions did not appear in the original texts of Judeo-Christian bibles; such divisions form part of the paratext of the Bible.Since the early 13th century, most copies and editions of the Bible have presented all but the shortest of the scriptural books with divisions into chapters, generally a page or so in length.Since the mid-16th century, editors have further subdivided each chapter into verses \u2013 each consisting of a few short lines or of one or more sentences.In the King James Version (KJV) Esther 8:9 is the longest verse[1] and John 11:35 is the shortest.[1] Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse, as in the case of Ephesians 2:8\u20139, and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse, as in the case of Genesis 1:2..The Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians.For instance, Jewish tradition regards the ascriptions to many Psalms as independent verses or as parts of the subsequent verses, whereas established Christian practice treats each Psalm ascription as independent and unnumbered, resulting in 116 more verses in Jewish versions than in the Christian texts.Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g.Hebrew Bibles have 1 Chronicles 5:27\u201341[2] where Christian translations have 1 Chronicles 6:1\u201315.[3][4].Early manuscripts of the biblical texts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers.In antiquity Hebrew texts were divided into paragraphs (parashot) that were identified by two letters of the Hebrew alphabet.Peh (\u05e4\u200e) indicated an \"open\" paragraph that began on a new line, while Samekh (\u05e1\u200e) indicated a \"closed\" paragraph that began on the same line after a small space.[5] These two letters begin the Hebrew words open (patuach) and closed (satum), and are, themselves, open in shape (\u05e4) and closed (\u05e1).The earliest known copies of the

antibacterial sulfonamides.[1][2].Allergies to sulfonamides are common.The overall incidence of adverse drug reactions to sulfa antibiotics is approximately 3%, close to penicillin;[3] hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully..Sulfonamide drugs were the first broadly effective antibacterials to be used systemically, and paved the way for the antibiotic revolution

bacteriostatic and inhibit growth and multiplication of bacteria, but do not kill them.Humans, in contrast to bacteria, acquire folate (vitamin B9) through the diet.[4].Sulfonamides are used to treat allergies and coughs, as well as having antifungal and antimalarial functions.The moiety is also present in other medications that are not antimicrobials, including thiazide diuretics (including

geese have been derived through selective breeding from the wild greylag goose (Anser anser domesticus) and swan goose (Anser cygnoides domesticus)..In Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia, the original domesticated geese are derived from the greylag goose (Anser anser).In eastern Asia, the original domesticated geese are derived from the swan goose (Anser cygnoides); these are commonly known as Chinese geese.Both have been widely introduced in more recent times, and modern flocks in both areas (and elsewhere, such as Australia and North America) may consist of either species or hybrids between them.Chinese geese may be readily distinguished from European geese by the large knob at the base of the bill, though hybrids may exhibit every degree of variation between the two species.[1].Charles Darwin remarked in The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication that the domestication of geese is of a very ancient date.[2] There is archaeological evidence for domesticated geese in Egypt more than 4,000 years ago.[3] It has been proposed that geese were domesticated around 3000 BCE in southeastern Europe, possibly in Greece, but reliable evidence of domestic geese comes from a much later period (8th century BCE) in The Odyssey.Another potential domestication site is in Egypt during the Old Kingdom (2686\u20131991 BCE) due to iconographic evidence of goose exploitation, but this scenario for the original domestication event has been considered less likely.Geese were also herded by ancient Mesopotamians for food and sacrifices and depicted in Mesopotamian art from the early Dynastic Period (2900\u20132350 BCE) onwards.Certainly, fully domesticated geese were present during the New Kingdom times in Egypt (1552\u20131151 BCE) and contemporaneously in Europe, and goose husbandry involving several varieties was well established by the Romans by the 1st century BCE.In the Medieval Period, goose husbandry was at its peak with large flocks kept by peasants.Archaeological evidence of the domestic goose in northern Europe indicates that it was probably introduced into Scandinavia during the Early Iron Age (400 BCE\u2013550 CE).[4].\nQ: when do geese lose their down\nReasoning: Domestic geese (Anser anser domesticus or Anser cygnoides) are domesticated grey geese (either Greylag Geese or Swan Geese ) kept as poultry for

holders.The national debt at any point in time is the face value of the then-outstanding Treasury securities that have been issued by the Treasury and other federal agencies.The terms \"national deficit\" and \"national surplus\" usually refer to the federal government budget balance from year to year, not the cumulative amount of debt.In a deficit year the national debt increases as the government needs to borrow funds to finance the deficit, while in a surplus year the debt decreases as more money is received than spent, enabling the government to reduce the debt by buying back some Treasury securities.In general, government debt increases as a result of government spending and decreases from tax or other receipts, both of which fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year.[1] There are two components of gross national debt:[2].Historically, the U.S.public debt as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) increases during wars and recessions and then subsequently declines.The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease as a result of a government surplus or via growth of GDP and inflation.For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP had peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but has since reached new highs of up to 134.84% of GDP during the second quarter of 2020.[3] In recent decades, aging demographics and rising healthcare costs have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.[4] The aggregate, gross amount that Treasury can borrow is limited by the United States debt ceiling.[5].Total US federal government debt breached $30 trillion mark for the first time in history in February 2022.[6] As of August 2023, total federal debt was $32.6 trillion; $25.8 trillion held by the public and

or less fatty parts of the back.It is eaten as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts), used as a central ingredient (e.g., the bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich (BLT)), or as a flavouring or accent (as in bacon bits in a salad)..Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant, and may also be used to insulate or flavour roast joints by being layered onto the meat.The word is derived from the Proto-Germanic *bakkon, meaning \"back meat\".[2].Meat from other animals, such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or turkey, may also be cut, cured, or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon, and may even be referred to as, for example, \"turkey bacon\".[3] Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations as both religions prohibit the consumption of pork.[4] Vegetarian bacons such as \"soy bacon\" also exist..Before the advent of cheap and widespread artificial refrigeration in the modern era, the curing of meat was necessary for its safe long-term preservation.However, both the flavour imparted to the meat in doing so and the extended shelf life it offered had become much prized, and although curing is in general no longer necessary in the developed world, it continues in wide use..Bacon is cured through either a process of injecting it with or soaking it in brine, known as wet curing, or rubbed with salt, known as dry curing.[1][5] Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably nitrites or nitrates, which speed the curing and stabilize colour.Cured bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, or it may be smoked or boiled.[1] Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying.Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating.Differing flavours can be achieved by using various types of wood, or less common fuels such as corn cobs or peat.This process can take up to eighteen hours,

but then remaining after the expiration of their visas, parole, TPS, etc.Illegal immigration has been a matter of intense debate in the United States since the 1980s.[citation needed].The illegal immigrant population of the United States peaked by 2007, when it was at 12.2 million and 4% of the total U.S.population.[4][5] Estimates in 2016 put the number of unauthorized immigrants at 10.7 million, representing 3.3% of the total U.S.population.[4] Since the Great Recession, more illegal immigrants have left the United States than entered it, and illegal border crossings were at the lowest in decades until 2021, when a record of 1.7 million people were caught trying to cross the southern border illegally.[6][7][8][9][10] Since 2007, visa overstays have accounted for a larger share of the growth in the illegal immigrant population than illegal border crossings,[11] which have declined considerably from 2000 to 2018.[12] In 2012, 52% of unauthorized immigrants were from Mexico, 15% from Central America, 12% from Asia, 6% from South America, 5% from the Caribbean, and another 5% from Europe and Canada.[13] As of 2016, approximately two-thirds of unauthorized adult immigrants had lived in the U.S.for at least a decade.[4].Opponents of illegal immigration argue that people who enter the United States illegally are criminals, as well as social and economic burdens on law-abiding natives.Opponents also argue that illegal immigrants who enter the United States illegally should be deported instead of being awarded with U.S.citizenship and social services.[14] Some argue that illegal immigrants should instead enter the United States lawfully through legal immigration.[15][16].Research shows that illegal immigrants increase the size of the U.S.economy, contribute

ligament of elbow joint is in relation with the ulnar nerve.The nerve is the largest in the human body unprotected by muscle or bone, so injury is common.[1] This nerve is directly connected to the little finger, and the adjacent half of the ring finger, innervating the palmar aspect of these fingers, including both front and back of the tips, perhaps as far back as the fingernail beds..This nerve can cause an electric shock-like sensation by striking the medial epicondyle of the humerus posteriorly, or inferiorly with the elbow flexed.The ulnar nerve is trapped between the bone and the overlying skin at this point.This is commonly referred to as bumping one's \"funny bone\".This name is thought to be a pun, based on the sound resemblance between the name of the bone of the upper arm, the humerus, and the word \"humorous\".[2] Alternatively, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, it may refer to \"the peculiar sensation experienced when it is struck\".[3].The ulnar nerve originates from the C8-T1 nerve roots (and occasionally carries C7 fibers which arise from the lateral cord),[4][5] which then form part of the medial cord of the brachial plexus, and descends medial to the brachial artery, up until the insertion point of coracobrachialis muscle (middle 5cm over the medial border of the humerus).Then, it pierces the medial intermuscular septum and enters the posterior compartment of the arm, accompanied by superior ulnar collateral vessels.It runs at the posteromedial aspects of the humerus, passing behind the medial epicondyle (in the cubital tunnel) at the elbow, where it can be palpated by hand.[6].The ulnar nerve is not a content of the cubital fossa.It enters the anterior (flexor) compartment of the forearm between the two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris,[5] and lies along the lateral border of the flexor carpi ulnaris.[5] The ulnar nerve runs between the flexor digitorum superficialis (laterally) and flexor digitorum profundus medially.\nQ:

Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.It enjoys popularity despite being widely regarded as pseudoscience by the scientific community.[1][2][3][4] The test attempts to assign a binary value to each of four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, and judging or perceiving.One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result representing one of sixteen possible personalities, such as \"ISTJ\" or \"ENFP\".[5][6][7].The MBTI was constructed by two Americans: Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, who were inspired by the book Psychological Types by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung.[8] Isabel Myers was particularly fascinated by the concept of introversion and she typed herself as an \"INFP\".However, she felt the book was too complex for the general public, and therefore she tried to organize the Jungian cognitive functions to make it more accessible.[9].Most of the research supporting the MBTI's validity has been produced by the Center for Applications of Psychological Type, an organization run by the Myers\u2013Briggs Foundation, and published in the center's own journal, the Journal of Psychological Type (JPT), raising questions of independence, bias, and conflict of interest.[10] Though the MBTI resembles some psychological theories, it has been criticized as pseudoscience[11] and is not widely endorsed by academic researchers in the psychology field.[12] The indicator exhibits significant scientific (psychometric) deficiencies, including poor validity, poor reliability, measuring categories that are not independent, and not being comprehensive.[13][14][15][16].Briggs began her research into personality in 1917.Upon meeting her future son-in-law, she observed marked differences between his personality and that of other family members.Briggs embarked on a project of reading biographies, and subsequently developed a typology wherein she proposed four temperaments: meditative (or thoughtful), spontaneous, executive, and social.[17][18].After the publication in 1923 of an English translation of Carl Jung's book Psychological Types (first published in German as Psychologische Typen in 1921), Briggs recognized that Jung's theory resembled, but went far beyond, her own.[19] Briggs's four types were later identified as corresponding to the IXXXs (Introverts: \"meditative\"), EXXPs (Extraverts & Prospectors: \"spontaneous\"), EXTJs (Extraverts, Thinkers & Judgers: \"executive\") and EXFJs (Extraverts, Feelers & Judgers: \"social\").[i][17][18] Her first publications were two articles describing Jung's theory, in The New Republic, \"Meet Yourself Using the Personality Paint Box\" (1926)[20] and \"Up From Barbarism\" (1928).[21] After extensively studying the work of Jung, Briggs and her daughter extended their interest in human behavior into efforts to turn the theory of psychological types to practical use.[6][17].Although Myers graduated from Swarthmore College in political science in 1919,[22] neither Myers nor Briggs were formally educated in the discipline of psychology, and both were self-taught in the field of psychometric testing.[23] Myers therefore apprenticed herself to Edward N.Hay (1891\u20131958), the head personnel officer for a large Philadelphia  bank.\nQ: What kind of personality test is the MBTI\nReasoning: Carl Jung in 1910."}, {"question_id":

the night: \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Unique and Artistic Picture,\" the former being won by the war epic Wings, and the latter by the art film Sunrise.Each award was intended to honor different

savings, reducing reliance on a publicly funded pension system.[2] Legislation to support the introduction of the superannuation guarantee was passed by the Keating Government in 1992.[2].Contributions to superannuation accounts are subject to a concessional income tax rate of 15%.This means that for most Australians, the tax on their money sent to a superannuation account is less than the tax on money sent to their bank account..Australians can contribute additional superannuation beyond the 11% minimum, subject to limits.The maximum amount that may be contributed per year is $27,500.[3] Contributions higher than this are taxed at the person's ordinary marginal tax rate, meaning there is no tax benefit for contributing beyond that amount.[4] Ultimately,

States, the Electoral College is the group of presidential electors required by the Constitution to form every 4 years for the sole purpose of appointing the president and vice president.Each state appoints electors under the methods described by its legislature, equal in number to its congressional delegation (representatives and senators).The federal District of Columbia also has 3 electors under an amendment adopted in 1961.Federal office holders, including senators and representatives, cannot be electors.Of the current 538 electors, a simple majority of 270 or more electoral votes is required to elect the president and vice president.If no candidate achieves a majority there, a contingent election is held by the House of Representatives to elect the president and by the Senate to elect the vice president..The states and the District of Columbia hold a statewide or districtwide popular vote on Election Day in November to choose electors based upon how they have pledged to vote for president and vice president, with some state laws prohibiting faithless electors.All states except Maine and Nebraska use a party block voting, or general ticket method, to choose their electors, meaning all their electors go to one winning ticket.Maine and Nebraska choose one elector per congressional district and 2 electors for the ticket with the highest statewide vote.The electors meet and vote in December, and the inauguration of the president and vice president take place in January..The merits of the electoral college system is a matter of ongoing debate in the United States, which came closest to switching to direct voting for president in 1969\u201370 (a transition all other democratic countries with electoral colleges for the executive head of state have made).[1] Supporters argue that it requires presidential candidates to have broad appeal across the country to win, while critics argue that it is not representative of the popular will of the nation.[a] Winner-take-all systems, especially with representation not proportional to population, does not align with the principle of \"one person, one vote\".[b][5] Critics object to the inequity that due to the distribution of electors, individual citizens in states with smaller populations have more voting power than those in larger states.[6] This is because the number of electors each state appoints is equal to the size of its congressional delegation, each state is entitled to at least 3 regardless of its population, and the apportionment of the statutorily fixed number of the rest is only roughly proportional.This allocation has contributed to runners-up of the nationwide popular vote being elected president in 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016.[7][8] In addition, faithless electors may not vote in accord with their pledge.[9][c] Further objection is that candidates focus their campaigns on swing states.[11].\nQ: when does the electoral college votes\nReasoning: Electoral College map

aerodynamic device whose intended design function is to 'spoil' unfavorable air movement across a body of a vehicle in motion, usually described as turbulence or drag.Spoilers on the front of a vehicle are often called air dams.Spoilers are often fitted to race and high-performance sports cars, although they have become common on passenger vehicles as well.Some spoilers are added to cars primarily for styling purposes and have either little aerodynamic benefit or even make the aerodynamics worse..The term \"spoiler\" is often mistakenly used interchangeably with \"wing\".An automotive wing is a device whose intended design is to generate downforce as air passes around it, not simply disrupt existing airflow patterns.[1][2] As such, rather than decreasing drag, automotive wings actually increase drag..Since spoiler is a term describing an application, the operation of a spoiler varies depending on the particular effect it is trying to spoil.Most common spoiler functions include disrupting some type of airflow passing over and around a moving vehicle.A common spoiler diffuses air by increasing amounts of turbulence flowing over the shape, \"spoiling\" the laminar flow and providing a cushion for the laminar boundary layer.[citation needed] However, other types of airflow may require the spoiler to operate differently and take on vastly different physical characteristics..While a mass is traveling at increasing speeds, the air of the environment affects its movement.Spoilers in racing are used in combination with other features on the body or chassis of race cars to change the handling characteristics that are affected by the air of the environment..Often, these devices are designed to be highly adjustable to suit the needs of racing on a given

force in the International System of Units (SI).[1] It is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745\u20131827)..One volt is defined as the electric potential between two points of a conducting wire when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points.[2] Equivalently, it is the potential difference between two points that will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge that passes through it.It can be expressed in terms of SI base units (m, kg, s, and A) as.It can also be expressed as amperes times ohms (current times resistance, Ohm's law), webers per second (magnetic flux per time), watts per ampere (power per current), or joules per coulomb (energy per charge), which is also equivalent to electronvolts per elementary charge:.The volt is named after Alessandro Volta.As with every SI unit named for a person, its symbol starts with an upper case letter (V), but when written in full, it follows the rules for capitalisation of a common noun; i.e., \"volt\" becomes capitalised at the beginning of a sentence and in titles but is otherwise in lower case..Historically, the \"conventional\" volt, V90, defined in 1987 by the 18th General Conference on Weights and Measures[3] and in use from 1990 to 2019, was implemented using the Josephson effect for exact frequency-to-voltage conversion, combined with the caesium frequency standard.Though the Josephson effect is still used to realize a volt, the constant used has changed slightly..For the Josephson constant, KJ = 2e/h (where e is the elementary charge and h is the Planck constant), a \"conventional\" value KJ-90 = 0.4835979GHz/\u03bcV was used for the purpose of defining the volt.As a consequence of the 2019 redefinition of SI base units, as of 2019 the Josephson constant has an exact value of KJ = 483597.84841698...GHz/V, which replaced the conventional value KJ-90..This standard is typically realized using a series-connected array of several thousand or tens of thousands of junctions, excited by microwave signals between 10 and 80GHz (depending on the array design).[4] Empirically, several experiments have shown that the method is independent of device design, material, measurement setup, etc., and no correction terms are required in a practical implementation.[5].In the water-flow analogy, sometimes used to explain electric circuits by comparing them with water-filled pipes, voltage (difference in electric potential) is likened to difference in water pressure, while current is proportional to  the amount of water flowing.\nQ: what are the units for volts\nReasoning: Josephson junction array chip developed by the National Bureau of Standards as a standard volt"}, {"question_id": "Q1123", "question": "who kill

\"swallowing\" is also used to describe the action of taking in a large mouthful of food without any biting, where the word gulping is more adequate..Swallowing comes so easily to most people that the process rarely prompts much thought.However, from the viewpoints of physiology, of speech\u2013language pathology, and of health care for people with difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia), it is an interesting topic with extensive scientific literature..Eating and swallowing are complex neuromuscular activities consisting essentially of three phases, an oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phase.Each phase is controlled by a different neurological mechanism.The oral phase, which is entirely voluntary, is mainly controlled by the medial temporal lobes and limbic system of the cerebral cortex with contributions from the motor cortex and other cortical areas.The pharyngeal swallow is started by the oral phase and subsequently is coordinated by the swallowing center on the medulla oblongata and pons.\nQ: what types of muscles are those of the swallowing mechanism?\nReasoning: Swallowing, known scientifically as deglutition, is the process in the human or animal body that makes something pass from the mouth , to the pharynx , and into the esophagus , while shutting the epiglottis ."}, {"question_id": "Q1137", "question": "what race was Thaddeus Stevens", "document_title": "Thaddeus

living cells in which proteins are produced using RNA molecules as templates.The generated protein is a sequence of amino acids.This sequence is determined by the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA.The nucleotides are considered three at a time.Each such triple results in addition of one specific amino acid to the protein being generated.The matching from nucleotide triple to amino acid is called the genetic code.The translation is performed by a large complex of functional RNA and proteins called ribosomes.The entire process is called gene expression..In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded in a ribosome, outside the nucleus, to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide.The polypeptide later folds into an active protein and performs its functions in the cell.The ribosome facilitates decoding by inducing the binding of complementary tRNA anticodon sequences to mRNA codons.The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a

Messaging Service  (MMS) is a standard way to send messages that include multimedia content to and from a mobile phone over a cellular network.Users and providers may refer to such a message as a PXT, a picture message, or a multimedia message.[1] The MMS standard extends the core SMS (Short Message Service) capability, allowing the exchange of text messages greater than 160 characters in length.Unlike text-only SMS, MMS can deliver a variety of media, including up to forty seconds of video, one image, a slideshow[2] of multiple images, or audio..The most common use involves sending photographs from camera-equipped handsets.[citation needed][needs update] Media companies have utilized MMS on a commercial basis as a method of delivering news and entertainment content, and retailers have deployed it as a tool for delivering scannable coupon codes, product images, videos, and other information..The 3GPP and WAP groups fostered the development of the MMS standard, which is now continued by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)..Multimedia messaging service was built using the technology of SMS messaging, first developed in 1984[2] as a captive technology which enabled

Variola major and Variola minor.", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by variola virus (often called smallpox virus)  which belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus.[7][11] The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977, and the World Health Organization (WHO) certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980,[10] making smallpox the only human disease to be eradicated.[12].The initial symptoms of the disease included fever and vomiting.[5] This was followed by formation of ulcers in the mouth and a skin rash.[5] Over a number of days, the skin rash turned into the characteristic fluid-filled blisters with a dent in the center.[5] The bumps then scabbed over and fell off, leaving scars.[5] The disease was transmitted from one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person or (rarely) via contaminated objects.[6][13][14] Prevention was achieved mainly through the smallpox vaccine.[9] Once the disease had developed, certain antiviral medications could potentially have helped, but such medications did not become available until after the disease was eradicated.[9] The risk of death was about 30%, with higher rates among babies.[6][15] Often, those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin, and some were left blind.[6].The earliest evidence of the disease dates to around 1500 BC in Egyptian mummies.[16][17] The disease historically occurred in outbreaks.[10] In 18th-century Europe, it is estimated that 400,000 people died from the disease per year, and that one-third of all cases of blindness were due to smallpox.[10][18] Smallpox is estimated to have killed up to 300million people in the 20th century[19][20] and around 500million people in the last 100 years of its existence.[21] Earlier deaths included six European monarchs.[10][18] As recently as 1967, 15million cases occurred a year.[10].Inoculation for smallpox appears to have started in China around the 1500s.[22][23] Europe adopted this practice from Asia in the first half of the 18th century.[24] In 1796, Edward Jenner introduced the modern smallpox vaccine.[25][26] In 1967, the WHO intensified efforts to eliminate the disease.[10] Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated, the other being rinderpest (a disease of even-toed ungulates) in 2011.[27][28] The term \"smallpox\" was first used in England in the 16th century to distinguish the disease from syphilis, which was then known as the \"great pox\".[29][30] Other historical names for the disease include pox, speckled monster, and red plague.[3][4][30].There are two forms of the smallpox.Variola major is the severe and most common form, with a more extensive rash and higher fever.Variola minor is a less common presentation, causing less severe disease, typically discrete smallpox, with historical death rates of 1% or less.[32] Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common.[33] In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons.This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by viral culture.[33] In addition, there were two very rare and fulminating types of smallpox, the malignant (flat) and hemorrhagic forms, which were usually fatal..The initial symptoms were similar to other viral diseases that are still extant, such as influenza and the common cold: fever of at least 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F), muscle pain, malaise, headache and fatigue.As the digestive tract was commonly involved, nausea, vomiting, and backache often occurred.The early prodromal stage usually lasted 2\u20134 days.By days 12\u201315, the first visible lesions \u2013 small reddish spots called enanthem \u2013 appeared on mucous membranes of the

electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG[a]), a recording of the heart's electrical activity through repeated cardiac cycles.[4] It is an electrogram of the heart which is a graph of voltage versus time of the electrical activity of the heart[5] using electrodes placed on the skin.These electrodes detect the small electrical changes that are a consequence of cardiac muscle depolarization followed by repolarization during each cardiac cycle (heartbeat).Changes in the normal ECG pattern occur in numerous cardiac abnormalities, including cardiac rhythm disturbances (such as atrial fibrillation[6] and ventricular tachycardia[7]), inadequate coronary artery blood flow (such as myocardial ischemia[8] and myocardial infarction[9]), and electrolyte disturbances (such as hypokalemia[10] and hyperkalemia[11])..Traditionally, \"ECG\" usually means a 12-lead ECG taken while lying down as discussed below..However, other devices can record the electrical activity of the heart such as a Holter monitor but also some models of smartwatch are capable of recording an ECG..ECG signals can be recorded in other contexts with other devices..In a conventional 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes are placed on the patient's limbs and on the surface of the chest.The overall magnitude of the heart's electrical potential is then measured from twelve different angles (\"leads\") and is recorded over a period of time (usually ten seconds).In this way, the overall magnitude and direction of the heart's electrical depolarization is captured at each moment throughout the cardiac cycle.[12].There are three main components to an ECG: the P wave, which represents depolarization of the atria; the QRS complex, which represents depolarization of the ventricles; and the T wave, which represents repolarization of the ventricles.[13].During each heartbeat, a healthy heart has an orderly progression of depolarization that starts with pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, spreads throughout the atrium, and passes through the atrioventricular node down into the bundle of His and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading down and to the left throughout the ventricles.[13] This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic ECG tracing.To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a large amount of information about the structure of the heart and the function of its electrical conduction system.[14] Among other things, an ECG can be used to measure the rate and rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the heart chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart's muscle cells or conduction system, the effects of heart drugs, and the function of implanted pacemakers.[15].\nQ: when an ekg has T wave inversion in lead 2\nReasoning: Twelve-lead EKG of a 26-year-old male"},

replacing those that capture images on photographic film.Digital cameras are now widely incorporated into mobile devices like smartphones with the same or more capabilities and features of dedicated cameras (which are still available).[2] High-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals and those who desire to take higher-quality photographs.[3].Digital and digital movie cameras share an optical system, typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device.[4] The diaphragm and shutter admit a controlled amount of light to the image, just as with film, but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical.However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory.Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound.Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing..The first semiconductor image sensor was the charge-coupled device (CCD), invented by Willard S.Boyle and George E.Smith at Bell Labs in 1969,[5] based on MOS capacitor technology.[6] The NMOS active-pixel sensor was later invented by Tsutomu Nakamura's team at Olympus in 1985,[7][8][9] which led to the development of the CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) at the NASA Jet

computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS.A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message.A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.[1][2].The hardware used to run a web server can vary according to the volume of requests that it needs to handle.At the low end of the range are embedded systems, such as a router that runs a small web server as its configuration interface.A high-traffic Internet website might handle requests with hundreds of servers that run on racks of high-speed computers..A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file (static content) available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates with the server software.The former usually can be served faster and can be more easily cached for repeated requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications..Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the

Rovers in Brazil, China, India, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom.The Land Rover name was created in 1948 by the Rover Company for a utilitarian 4WD off-road vehicle; currently, the Land Rover range consists solely of upmarket and luxury sport utility vehicles..Land Rover was granted a Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1951,[4][5] and 50 years later, in 2001, it received a Queen's Award for Enterprise for outstanding contribution to international trade.[6] Over time, Land Rover grew into its own brand (and for a while also a company), encompassing a consistently growing range of four-wheel drive, off-road capable models.Starting with the much more upmarket 1970 Range Rover, and subsequent introductions of the mid-range Discovery and entry-level Freelander line (in 1989 and 1997), as well as the 1990 Land Rover Defender refresh, the marque today includes two models of Discovery, four distinct models of Range Rover, and after a three-year hiatus, a second generation of Defenders have gone into production for the 2020 model year\u2014in short or long wheelbase, as before..For half a century (from the original 1948 model, through 1997, when the Freelander was introduced), Land Rovers and Range Rovers exclusively relied on their trademark boxed-section vehicle frames.Land Rover used boxed frames in a direct product bloodline until the termination of the original Defender in 2016; and their last body-on-frame model was replaced by a monocoque with the third generation Discovery in 2017.Since then all Land Rovers and Range Rovers have a unified body

disorder (GAD), and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD).However, for OCD, cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly in combination with sertraline, is a better treatment.[citation needed] Although approved for  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sertraline leads to only modest improvement in this condition.[11][12] Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently (luteal phase dosing) for its treatment.[13].Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of diarrhea, nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild.Similar to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a mildly elevated rate of suicidal thoughts in people under the age of 25 years old.It should not be used together with MAO

motor vehicle.Its main purpose is to provide an electric current to the electric-powered starting motor, which in turn starts the chemically-powered internal combustion engine that actually propels the vehicle.Once the engine is running, power for the car's electrical systems is still supplied by the battery, with the alternator charging the battery as demands increase or decrease..Typically, starting uses less than three percent of the battery capacity.For this reason, automotive batteries are designed to deliver maximum current for a short period of time.They are sometimes referred to as \"SLI batteries\" for this reason, for starting, lighting and ignition.SLI batteries are not designed for deep discharging, and a full discharge can reduce the battery's lifespan.[1].As well as starting the engine, an SLI battery supplies the extra power necessary when the vehicle's electrical requirements exceed the supply from the charging system.It is also a stabilizer, evening out potentially damaging voltage spikes.[2] While the engine is running most of the power is provided by the alternator, which includes a voltage regulator to keep the output between 13.5 and 14.5V.[3] Modern SLI batteries are lead-acid type, using six series-connected cells to provide a nominal 12-volt system (in most passenger vehicles and light trucks), or twelve cells for a 24-volt system in heavy trucks or earth-moving equipment, for example.[4].Gas explosions can occur at the negative electrode where hydrogen gas can build up due to blocked battery vents or a poorly ventilated setting, combined with an ignition source.[5] Explosions during engine start-up are typically associated with corroded or dirty battery posts.[5] A 1993 study by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that 31% of vehicle battery explosion injuries occurred while charging the battery.[6] The next-most common scenarios were while working on cable connections, while jump-starting, typically by failing to connect to the dead battery before the charging source and failing to connect to the vehicle chassis rather than directly to the grounded battery post, and while checking fluid levels.[5][6] Close to two-thirds of those injured suffered chemical burns, and nearly three-fourths suffered eye injuries, among other possible injuries.[6].Electric vehicles (EVs) are powered by a high-voltage electric vehicle battery, but they usually have an automotive battery as well, so that they can use standard automotive accessories which are designed to run on 12V.They are often

initial listing.Congress has sometimes scheduled other substances through legislation such as the Hillory J.Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Prevention Act of 2000, which placed gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) in Schedule I and sodium oxybate (the isolated sodium salt in GHB) in Schedule III when used under an FDA New Drug Application (NDA) or Investigational New Drug (IND).[2][3] Classification decisions are required to be made on criteria including potential for abuse (an undefined term),[4] currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and international treaties.The nation first outlawed addictive drugs in the early 1900s and the International Opium Convention helped lead international agreements regulating trade.[5][6][7] The Food and Drugs Act of 1906 was the beginning of over 200 laws concerning public health and consumer protections.[8] Others were the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (1938), and the Kefauver Harris Amendment of 1962.[9].In 1969, President Richard Nixon announced that the Attorney General, John N.Mitchell, was preparing a comprehensive new measure to more effectively meet the narcotic and dangerous drug problems at the federal level by combining all existing federal laws into a single new statute.With the help of White House Counsel head, John Dean; the Executive Director of the Shafer Commission, Michael Sonnenreich; and the Director of the BNDD, John Ingersoll creating and writing the legislation, Mitchell was able to present Nixon with the bill.[10].The CSA not only combined existing federal

numeral system was the system to represent numbers and calendar dates in the Maya civilization.It was a vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system.The numerals are made up of three symbols: zero (a shell),[1] one (a dot) and five (a bar).For example, thirteen is written as three dots in a horizontal row above two horizontal bars; sometimes it is also written as three vertical dots to the left of two vertical bars.With these three symbols, each of the twenty vigesimal digits could be written..Numbers after 19 were written vertically in powers of twenty.The Maya used powers of twenty, just as the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system uses powers of ten.[2] For example, thirty-three would be written as one dot, above three dots atop two bars.The first dot represents \"one twenty\" or \"1\u00d720\", which is added to three dots and two bars, or thirteen.Therefore, (1\u00d720) + 13 = 33.Upon reaching 202 or 400, another row is started (203 or 8000, then 204 or 160,000, and so on).The number 429 would be written as one dot above one dot above four dots and a bar, or (1\u00d7202) + (1\u00d7201) + 9 = 429..Other than the bar and dot notation, Maya numerals were sometimes

in the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and embryogenesis of humans and other species.[1][13] It belongs to a group of steroid hormones called the progestogens[13] and is the major progestogen in the body.Progesterone has a variety of important functions in the body.It is also a crucial metabolic intermediate in the production of other endogenous steroids, including the sex hormones and the corticosteroids, and plays an important role in brain function as a neurosteroid.[14].In addition to its role as a natural hormone, progesterone is also used as a medication, such as in combination with estrogen for contraception, to reduce the risk of uterine or cervical cancer, in hormone replacement therapy, and in feminizing hormone therapy.[15] It was first prescribed in 1934.[16].Progesterone is the most important progestogen in the body.As a potent agonist of the nuclear progesterone receptor (nPR) (with an affinity of KD = 1 nM) the resulting effects on ribosomal transcription plays a major role in regulation of female reproduction.[13][17] In addition, progesterone is an agonist of the more recently discovered membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs),[18] of which the expression has regulation effects in reproduction function (oocyte maturation, labor, and sperm motility) and cancer although additional research is required to further define the roles.[19] It also functions as a ligand of the PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) which impacts tumor progression, metabolic regulation, and viability control of nerve cells.[20][21][22] Moreover, progesterone is also known to be an antagonist of the sigma \u03c31 receptor,[23][24] a negative allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,[14] and a potent antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).[25] Progesterone prevents MR activation by binding to this receptor with an affinity exceeding even those of aldosterone and glucocorticoids such as cortisol and corticosterone,[25] and produces antimineralocorticoid effects, such as natriuresis, at physiological concentrations.[26] In addition, progesterone binds to and behaves as a partial agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), albeit with very low potency (EC50 >100-fold less relative to cortisol).[27][28].Progesterone, through its neurosteroid active metabolites such as 5\u03b1-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone, acts indirectly as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor.[29].Progesterone and some of its metabolites, such as 5\u03b2-dihydroprogesterone, are agonists of the pregnane X receptor (PXR),[30] albeit weakly so (EC50 >10 \u03bcM).[31] In accordance, progesterone induces several hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes,[32] such as CYP3A4,[33][34] especially during pregnancy when concentrations are much higher than usual.[35] Perimenopausal women have been found to have greater CYP3A4 activity relative to men and postmenopausal women, and it has been inferred that this may be due to the higher progesterone levels present in perimenopausal women.[33].Progesterone modulates the activity of CatSper (cation channels of sperm) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.Since eggs release progesterone, sperm may use progesterone as a homing signal to swim toward eggs (chemotaxis).As a result, it has been suggested that substances that block the progesterone binding site on CatSper channels could potentially be used in male contraception.[36][37].Progesterone has a number of physiological effects that are amplified in the presence of estrogens.\nQ: what are the effects of low progesterone levels in a woman\nReasoning: Progesterone also known as P4 (pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) is a C-21 steroid hormone

to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible..In 1904\u20131905, the Wright brothers developed their flying machine to make longer-running and more aerodynamic flights with the Wright Flyer II, followed by the first truly practical fixed-wing aircraft, the Wright Flyer III.The brothers' breakthrough was their creation of a three-axis control system, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium.[6][7][8][9] This method remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds.[10][11]:\u200a183\u200a From the beginning of their aeronautical work, Wilbur and Orville focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving \"the flying problem\".This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines.[12] Using a small home-built wind tunnel, the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before, enabling them

bicycles, motors, and other machinery.Their work with bicycles, in particular, influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.[13]:\u200a169\u200a This was a trend, as many other aviation pioneers were also dedicated cyclists and involved in the bicycle business in various ways.[15] From 1900 until their first

their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers.[16].The Wright brothers' status as inventors of the airplane has been subject to counter-claims by various parties.Much controversy persists over the many competing claims of early aviators.Edward Roach, historian for the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, argues that they were excellent self-taught

at Southwark, close to the south bank of the Thames, by Shakespeare's playing company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men.It was destroyed by fire on 29 June 1613.A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and stayed open until the  London theatre closures of 1642.As well as plays by Shakespeare, early works by Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker and John Fletcher were first performed here.[4].A modern reconstruction of the Globe, named \"Shakespeare's Globe\", opened in 1997 approximately 750 feet (230m) from the site of the original theatre.[5].Examination of old leases and parish records has identified the plot of land acquired for building The Globe as extending from the west side of modern-day Southwark Bridge Road eastwards as far as Porter Street and from Park Street southwards as far as the back of Gatehouse Square.[6][7] It was being offered for rent by Thomas Brend, who was a neighbour to John Heminges and Henry Condell,  actors with the Chamberlain's Men.[8].The precise location of the building remained unknown until a small part of the foundations, including one original pier base, was discovered in 1989 by the Department of Greater London Archaeology (now Museum of London Archaeology) beneath the car park at the rear of Anchor Terrace on Park Street.[9] The shape of the foundations is now replicated on the surface.As the majority of the foundations lies beneath 67\u201370 Anchor Terrace, a listed building, no further excavations have been permitted.[10].The Globe was owned by actors who were also shareholders in the Lord Chamberlain's Men.Two of the six Globe shareholders, Richard Burbage and his brother Cuthbert Burbage, owned double shares of the whole, or 25 per cent each; the other four men, Shakespeare, John Heminges, Augustine Phillips, and Thomas Pope, owned a single share, or 12.5 per cent.(Originally William Kempe was intended to be the seventh partner, but he sold out his share to the four minority sharers, leaving them with more

personal dreams in order to help others in his community and whose thoughts of suicide on Christmas Eve bring about the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers).[4] Clarence shows George all the lives he touched and what the world would be like if he did not exist..Theatrically, the film's break-even point was $6.3million, about twice the production cost, a figure it did not come close to achieving on its initial release.Because of the film's disappointing sales, Capra was seen by some studios as having lost his ability to produce popular, financially successful films.[5] Although It's a Wonderful Life initially received mixed reviews and was unsuccessful at the box office, it became a Christmas classic after its copyright lapsed in 1974 and it fell into the public domain, which allowed it to be broadcast without licensing or royalty fees.[6].Today, It's a Wonderful Life is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and among the best Christmas films.[7] It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and has been recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made.[8] It was No.11 on the American Film Institute's 1998 greatest movie list, No.20 on its 2007 greatest movie list, and No.1 on its list of the most inspirational American films of all time.[9] Capra revealed

liverworts, hornworts and mosses.[1] In the strict sense, Bryophyta consists of the mosses only.Bryophytes are characteristically limited in size and prefer moist habitats although they can survive in drier environments.[2] The bryophytes consist of about 20,000 plant species.[3][4] Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures (gametangia and sporangia), but they do not produce flowers or seeds.They reproduce sexually by spores and asexually by fragmentation or the production of gemmae.[5] Though bryophytes were considered a paraphyletic group in recent years, almost all of the most recent phylogenetic evidence supports the monophyly of this group, as originally classified by Wilhelm Schimper in 1879.[6] The term bryophyte comes from Ancient Greek  \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03bf\u03bd

growing in a range of temperatures (cold arctics and in hot deserts), elevations (sea-level to alpine), and moisture (dry deserts to wet rain forests).Bryophytes can grow where vascularized plants cannot because they do not depend on roots for uptake of nutrients from soil.Bryophytes can survive on rocks and bare soil.[8].Like all land plants (embryophytes), bryophytes have life cycles with alternation of generations.[9] In each cycle, a haploid gametophyte, each of whose cells contains a fixed number of unpaired chromosomes, alternates with a diploid sporophyte, whose cells contain two sets of paired chromosomes.Gametophytes produce haploid sperm and eggs which fuse to form diploid zygotes that grow into sporophytes.Sporophytes produce haploid spores by meiosis, that grow into gametophytes..Bryophytes are gametophyte dominant,[10] meaning that the more prominent, longer-lived plant is the haploid gametophyte.\nQ: what are the characteristics of bryophytes\nReasoning:

ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords..Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world.In

early Renaissance Italy, to the rich cities in the centre and north like Florence, Lucca, Siena, Venice and Genoa.The Bardi and Peruzzi families dominated banking in 14th-century Florence, establishing branches in many other parts of Europe.[8] Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici set up one of the most famous Italian banks, the Medici Bank, in 1397.[9] The Republic of Genoa founded the

fourth of the four canonical gospels.It contains a highly schematic account of the ministry of Jesus, with seven \"signs\" culminating in the raising of Lazarus (foreshadowing the resurrection of Jesus) and seven \"I am\" discourses (concerned with issues of the church\u2013synagogue debate at the time of composition)[3] culminating in Thomas' proclamation of the risen Jesus as \"my Lord and my God\".[4] The gospel's concluding verses set out its purpose, \"that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.\"[5][6].John reached its final form around AD 90\u2013110,[7] although it contains signs of origins dating back to AD 70 and possibly even earlier.[8]  Like the three other gospels, it is anonymous, although it identifies an unnamed \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" as the source of its traditions.[9][10] It most likely arose within a \"Johannine community\",[11][12] and \u2013 as it is closely related in style and content to the three Johannine epistles \u2013 most scholars treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not from the same author.[13].The Gospel of John, like all the gospels, is anonymous.[14] John 21:22[15] references a disciple whom Jesus loved and John 21:24\u201325[16] says: \"This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true...\"[11] Early Christian tradition, first found in Irenaeus (c.\u2009130\u2013 c.\u2009202 AD), identified this disciple with John the Apostle, but most scholars have abandoned this hypothesis or hold it only tenuously[17] \u2013 there are multiple reasons for this conclusion, including, for example, the fact that the gospel is written in good Greek and displays sophisticated theology, and is therefore unlikely to have been the work of a simple fisherman.[18] These verses imply rather that the core of the gospel relies on the testimony (perhaps written) of the \"disciple who is testifying\", as collected, preserved and reshaped by a community of followers (the \"we\" of the passage), and that a single follower (the \"I\") rearranged this material and perhaps added the final chapter and other passages to produce the final gospel.[11] Most scholars estimate the final form of the text to be around AD 90\u2013110.[7] Given its complex history there may have been more than one place of composition, and while the author was familiar with Jewish customs and traditions, his frequent clarification of these implies that he wrote for a mixed Jewish/Gentile or Jewish context outside Palestine.[citation needed].The author may have drawn on a \"signs source\" (a collection of miracles) for chapters 1\u201312, a \"passion source\" for the story of Jesus's arrest and crucifixion, and a \"sayings source\" for the discourses, but these hypotheses are much debated.[19] He seems to have known some version of Mark and Luke, as he shares with them some items of vocabulary and clusters of incidents arranged in the same order,[20][21] but key terms from those gospels are absent or nearly so, implying that if he did know them he felt free to write independently.[21] The Hebrew scriptures were an important source,[22] with 14 direct quotations (versus 27 in Mark, 54 in Matthew, 24 in Luke), and their influence is vastly increased when allusions and echoes are included,[23] but the majority of John's direct quotations do not agree exactly with any known version of the Jewish scriptures.[24] Recent arguments by Richard Bauckham and others that the Gospel of John preserves eyewitness testimony have not won general acceptance.[25][26].For much of the 20th century, scholars interpreted the Gospel of John within the paradigm of a hypothetical \"Johannine community\",[27] meaning that the gospel sprang from a late-1st-century Christian community excommunicated from the Jewish synagogue (probably meaning the Jewish community)[28] on account of its belief in Jesus as the promised Jewish messiah.[29] This interpretation, which saw the community as essentially sectarian and standing outside the mainstream of early Christianity, has been increasingly challenged in the first decades of the 21st century,[30] and there is currently considerable debate over the social, religious and historical context of the gospel.[31] Nevertheless, the Johannine literature as a whole (made up of the gospel, the three Johannine epistles, and Revelation), points to a community holding itself distinct from the Jewish culture from which it arose while cultivating an intense devotion to Jesus as the definitive revelation of a God with whom they were in close contact through the Paraclete.[32].The majority of scholars see four sections in the Gospel of John: a prologue (1:1\u201318); an account of the ministry, often called the \"Book of Signs\" (1:19\u201312:50); the account of Jesus' final night with his disciples and the passion and resurrection, sometimes called the Book of Glory[33] or Book of Exaltation  (13:1\u201320:31);[34] and a conclusion (20:30\u201331); to these is added an epilogue which most scholars believe did not form part of the original text (Chapter 21).[33] Disagreement does exist; some scholars such as Richard Bauckham argue that John 21 was part of the original work, for example.[35].The structure is highly schematic: there are seven \"signs\" culminating in the raising of Lazarus (foreshadowing the resurrection of Jesus), and seven \"I am\" sayings and discourses, culminating in Thomas's proclamation of the risen Jesus as \"my Lord and my God\" (the same title, dominus et deus, claimed by the Emperor Domitian, an indication of the date of composition).[4].Scholars agree that while John clearly regards Jesus as divine, he just as clearly subordinates him to the one God.[41] According to James Dunn, this Christology view in John, does not describe a subordinationist relation, but rather the authority and validity of the Son's\"revelation\"of the Father, the continuity between the Father and the Son.Dunn sees this view as intended to serve the Logos Christology,[42] while others (e.g.,Andrew Loke) see it as connected to the incarnation theme in John.[43] The idea of the Trinity developed only slowly through the merger of Hebrew monotheism and the idea of the messiah, Greek ideas of the relationship between God, the world, and the mediating Saviour, and the Egyptian concept of the three-part divinity.[44] However, while the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament possesses a triadic understanding of God[45] and contains a number of Trinitarian formulas.[46][47] John's \"high Christology\" depicts Jesus as divine and pre-existent, defends him against Jewish claims that he was \"making himself equal to God\",[48][49] and talks openly about his divine role and echoing Yahweh's \"I Am that I Am\" with seven \"I Am\" declarations of his own.[50][b].In the prologue, the gospel identifies Jesus as the Logos or Word.In Ancient Greek philosophy, the term logos meant the principle of cosmic reason.[58] In this sense, it was similar to the Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation.[59] The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world.\nQ: what the multiple

United States in the Gulf of Mexico on the BP-operated Macondo Prospect,[6][7][8][9] considered to be the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry and estimated to be 8 to 31 percent larger in volume than the previous largest, the Ixtoc I oil spill, also in the Gulf of Mexico.The United States federal government estimated the total discharge at 4.9MMbbl (210,000,000USgal; 780,000m3).[3] After several failed efforts to contain the flow, the well was declared sealed on 19 September 2010.[10] Reports in early 2012 indicated that the well site was still leaking.[11][12] The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is regarded as one of the largest environmental disasters in world history..A massive response ensued to protect beaches, wetlands and estuaries from the spreading oil utilizing skimmer ships, floating booms, controlled burns and 1,840,000USgal (7,000m3) of oil dispersant.[13] Due to the months-long spill, along with adverse effects from the response and cleanup activities, extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats and fishing and tourism industries was reported.[14]   In Louisiana, oil cleanup crews worked four days a week on 55mi (89km) of Louisiana shoreline throughout 2013.4,900,000lb (2,200t) of oily material was removed from the beaches in 2013, over double the amount collected in 2012.[15] Oil continued to be found as far from the Macondo site as the waters off the Florida Panhandle and Tampa Bay, where scientists said the oil and dispersant mixture is embedded in the sand.[16]  In April 2013, it was reported that dolphins and other marine life continued to die in record numbers with infant dolphins dying at six times the normal rate.[17]  One study released in 2014 reported that tuna and amberjack that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs that would be expected to be fatal or at least life-shortening and another study found that cardiotoxicity might have been widespread in animal life exposed to the spill.[18][19].Numerous investigations explored the causes of the explosion and record-setting spill.The United States Government report, published in September 2011, pointed to defective cement on the well, faulting mostly BP, but also rig operator Transocean and contractor Halliburton.[20][21] Earlier in 2011, a White House commission likewise blamed BP and its partners for a series of cost cutting decisions and an inadequate safety system, but also concluded that the spill resulted from \"systemic\" root causes and \"absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies, might well recur\".[22].In November 2012, BP and the United States Department of Justice settled federal criminal charges, with BP pleading guilty to 11 counts of manslaughter, two misdemeanors, and a felony count of lying to the United States Congress.BP also agreed to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics, and the Environmental Protection Agency announced that BP would be temporarily banned from new contracts with the United States government.BP and the Department of Justice agreed to a record-setting $4.525billion in fines and other payments.[23][24][25]  As of 2018[update], cleanup costs, charges and penalties had cost the company more than $65billion.[26][27].In September 2014, a United States District Court judge ruled that BP was primarily responsible for the oil spill because of its gross negligence and reckless conduct.[28] In April 2016, BP agreed to pay $20.8billion in fines, the largest environmental damage settlement in United States history.[29].Deepwater Horizon was a 10-year-old[30] semi-submersible, mobile, floating, dynamically positioned drilling rig that could operate

chartered to BP from March 2008 to September 2013.[2] It was drilling a deep exploratory well, 18,360ft (5,600m) below sea level, in approximately 5,100ft (1,600m) of water.The well is situated in the

for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy..Comet Halley is commonly pronounced /\u02c8h\u00e6li/, rhyming with valley, or /\u02c8he\u026ali/, rhyming with daily.[19][20] Colin Ronan, one of Edmond Halley's biographers, preferred /\u02c8h\u0254\u02d0li/, rhyming with crawly.[21] Spellings of Halley's name during his lifetime included Hailey, Haley, Hayley, Halley, Hawley, and Hawly, so its contemporary pronunciation is uncertain, but the version rhyming with valley seems to be preferred by current bearers of the surname.[22].Halley was the first comet to be recognized as periodic.Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere.This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon.Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.[23].In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in which he outlined his laws of gravity and motion.\nQ: where did halley's comet come from\nReasoning: Halley's Comet or Comet Halley ( or ), officially designated 1P/Halley, is the best-known of the short-period comets and is visible from Earth every 75\u201376 years."}, {"question_id": "Q1252", "question": "what are the 40 largest cities in the us", "document_title": "List of United States cities by population", "answer": "The following is a list of the most populous incorporated places of the United States of America .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Download coordinates as:.This is a list of the most populous incorporated places of the United States.As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place includes cities, towns, villages, boroughs, and municipalities.[a] A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.[b] Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent.Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places.This list presents only the portion of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place..This list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits;

their main role is to win high balls in the air, hold up the ball, and create chances for other members of the team, in addition to possibly scoring many goals themselves.However, the two terms are not necessarily synonymous, with the target forward having developed into a more specialised role, while the centre-forward description is more broad, encompassing many types of forwards.[6].\nQ: what is a forward in soccer\nReasoning: A New Zealand forward (in white) takes a shot on goal against Cameroon in the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup ."}, {"question_id": "Q1255", "question": "WHO QUALIFIES AS A DOMESTIC PARTNER IN CA", "document_title": "Domestic partnership in California", "answer": "A California domestic partnership is a legal relationship available to same-sex couples, and to certain opposite-sex couples in which at least one party is at least 18 years of age.", "label": 1, "input": null}, {"question_id": "Q1256", "question": "where did mark jackson play pro basketball?", "document_title": "Mark Jackson (basketball)", "answer": "Mark A.

cultural applications, psilocybin mushrooms are used as recreational drugs.They may be depicted in Stone Age rock art in Africa and Europe, but are more certainly represented in pre-Columbian sculptures and glyphs seen throughout the Americas..Psilocybin mushrooms have been[when?] and continue to be used in indigenous South American cultures in religious, divinatory, or spiritual contexts.[1][failed verification].Rock art from c.\u20099000\u20137000 BCE from Tassili, Algeria, is believed to depict psychedelic mushrooms and the transformation of the user under their influence.[2] Prehistoric rock art near Villar del Humo in Spain suggests that Psilocybe hispanica was used in religious rituals 6,000 years ago.[3] The hallucinogenic[4] species of the Psilocybe genus have a history of use among the native peoples of Mesoamerica for religious communion, divination, and healing, from pre-Columbian times to the present day.[5] Mushroom stones and motifs have been found in Guatemala.[6] A statuette dating from c.\u2009200 CE depicting a mushroom strongly resembling Psilocybe mexicana was found in the west Mexican state of Colima in a shaft and chamber

mushrooms when translated into English.[7] Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan reported the ritualistic use of teonan\u00e1catl by the Aztecs when he traveled to Central America after the expedition of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.[8].After the Spanish conquest, Catholic missionaries campaigned against the cultural tradition of the Aztecs, dismissing the Aztecs as idolaters, and the use of hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms, together with other pre-Christian traditions, was quickly suppressed.[6] The Spanish believed the mushroom allowed the Aztecs and others to communicate with demons.Despite this

research on the vagina is especially lacking for different animals, its location, structure and size are documented as varying among species.Female mammals usually have two external openings in the vulva; these are the urethral opening for the urinary tract and the vaginal opening for the genital tract.This is different from male mammals, who usually have a single urethral opening for both urination and reproduction.The vaginal opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the labia in humans.In amphibians, birds, reptiles and monotremes, the cloaca

Edmund Muskie was disrupted at least four times in Florida in 1972 with the use of stink bombs during the Florida presidential primary.[3] Stink bombs were set off at campaign picnics in Miami and Tampa, at the Muskie campaign headquarters in Tampa and at offices in Tampa where the campaign's telephone bank was located.[3] The stink bomb plantings served to disrupt the picnics and campaign operations, and was deemed by the U.S.Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities of the U.S.Senate to have \"disrupted, confused, and unnecessarily interfered with a campaign for the office of the Presidency\".[3].In 2004, it was reported that the Israeli weapons research and development directorate had created a liquid stink bomb, dubbed the \"skunk bomb\", with an odor that lingers for five years on clothing.[4] It is a synthetic stink bomb based upon the chemistry of the spray that is emitted from the anal glands of the skunk.[4] It was designed as a crowd control tool to be used as a deterrent that causes people to scatter, such as at a protest.[4] It has been described as a less than lethal weapon.[4].At the lower end of the spectrum, relatively harmless stink bombs consist of a mixture of ammonium sulfide, vinegar and bicarbonate, which smells strongly of rotten eggs.[2] When exposed to air, the ammonium sulfide reacts with moisture, hydrolyzes, and a mixture of hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell) and ammonia is released.Another mixture consists of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia mixed together directly.[5].Other popular substances on which to base stink bombs are thiols with lower molecular weight such as methyl mercaptan and ethyl mercaptan\u2014the chemicals that are added in minute quantities to natural gas in order to make gas leaks detectable by

the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations, and as such there are a number of both modern and historical cultures whose number of seasons varies..The Northern Hemisphere experiences most direct sunlight during May, June, and July, as the hemisphere faces the Sun.The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January.It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux.However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere..In temperate and sub-polar regions, four seasons based on the Gregorian calendar are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn (or fall), and winter.Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions which are not tied to any fixed calendar dates: prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, autumnal, and hibernal.Many tropical regions have two seasons: the rainy, wet, or monsoon season and the dry season.Some have a third cool, mild, or harmattan season.\"Seasons\" can also be dictated by the timing

Game marks the only posthumous Tupac album not to feature any original production.When remixing these songs, Eminem used various unusual production techniques, namely, modifying the pace and pitch of Tupac's voice to better suit the instrumentals he produced.The style of the production on the album fitted more to the form of a Shady/Aftermath release, of which Eminem partly created, than it did to any original or previous posthumous Tupac release.[9] There were also various uses of cutting and pasting vocals to produce new words synonymous with rap culture at that time, such as making it sound as though Tupac is saying, \"2005\", \"G-Unit\", \"Obie Trice\" and \"Em\".[9].Although Loyal to the Game was produced by Eminem, the album does feature four bonus remixes, with production coming from

Golden Arm Awards as a senior en route to victory in the 1997 SEC Championship..Manning was selected first overall in the 1998 NFL Draft by the Colts, where he served as their starting quarterback from 1998 to 2010.He helped transform the struggling Colts franchise into consistent playoff contenders, leading them to 11 playoff appearances, eight division titles, three AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl appearances, and one championship title in Super Bowl XLI, the franchise's first in over three decades and first since relocating to Indianapolis.[9][10][11][12][13] Manning was also named Super Bowl MVP in the victory.After undergoing neck surgery that sidelined him for the 2011 season, Manning was released by the Colts and signed with the Broncos.Serving as the Broncos' starting quarterback from 2012 to 2015, he helped them clinch their division each season and reach two Super Bowls.Manning's career ended with a victory in Super Bowl 50, making him the first starting quarterback to win the Super Bowl for more than one franchise.[14].Manning holds many NFL records, including MVP awards,[15] quarterback first-team All-Pro selections,[16] 4,000-yard passing

evolved through endosymbiosis, through multicellular marine and freshwater green algae, to spore-bearing terrestrial bryophytes, lycopods and ferns, and eventually to the complex seed-bearing gymnosperms and angiosperms (flowering plants) of today.While many of the earliest groups continue to thrive, as exemplified by red and green algae in marine environments, more recently derived groups have displaced previously ecologically dominant ones; for example, the ascendance of flowering plants over gymnosperms in terrestrial environments.[1]:\u200a498.There is evidence that cyanobacteria and multicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes lived in freshwater communities on land as early as 1 billion years ago,[2] and that communities of complex, multicellular photosynthesizing organisms existed on land in the late Precambrian, around 850million years ago.[3].Evidence of the emergence of embryophyte land plants first occurs in the mid-Ordovician (~470million years ago), and by the middle of the Devonian (~390million years ago), many of the features recognised in land plants today were present, including roots and leaves.By the late Devonian (~370million years ago) some free-sporing plants such as Archaeopteris had secondary vascular tissue that produced wood and had formed forests of tall trees.Also by the late Devonian, Elkinsia, an early seed fern, had evolved seeds.[4].Evolutionary innovation continued throughout the rest of the Phanerozoic eon and still continues today.Most plant groups were relatively unscathed by the Permo-Triassic extinction event, although the structures of communities changed.This may have set the scene for the appearance of the flowering plants in the Triassic (~200million years ago), and their later diversification in the Cretaceous and Paleogene.The latest major group of plants to evolve were the grasses, which became important in the mid-Paleogene, from around 40million years ago.The grasses, as well as many other groups, evolved new mechanisms of metabolism to survive the low CO2 and warm, dry conditions of the tropics over the last 10 millionyears..Land plants evolved from a group of freshwater green algae, perhaps as early as 850 mya,[3] but algae-like plants might have evolved as early as 1 billion years ago.[2] The closest living relatives of land plants are the charophytes, specifically Charales; assuming that the habit of the Charales has changed little since the divergence of lineages, this means that the land plants evolved from a branched, filamentous alga dwelling in shallow fresh water,[5] perhaps at the edge of seasonally desiccating pools.[6] However, some recent evidence suggests that land plants might have originated from unicellular terrestrial charophytes similar to extant Klebsormidiophyceae.[7] The alga would have had a haplontic life cycle.\nQ: what is a major trend in land plant evolution\nReasoning: A late Silurian sporangium ."}, {"question_id": "Q1287",

and Wales) is any fee for services provided where the fee is payable only if there is a favourable result.Although such a fee may be used in many fields, it is particularly well associated with legal practice..In the law, a contingent fee is defined as a fee charged for a lawyer's services that is payable only if a lawsuit is successful or results in a favorable settlement, usually in the form of a percentage of the amount recovered on behalf of the client.[1] Contingent fees may make it easier for people of limited means to pursue their civil rights since otherwise, to sue someone for a tort, one must first be wealthy enough to pursue such litigation in the first place.[2] Due to the risk of loss, attorneys will not take cases on a contingency basis unless they believe that the case has merit, although accepting cases on a contingency is not without risk.[3].Under a traditional contingency fee arrangement, a client is not charged attorney fees if he loses the case.If the client recovers damages from settlement or a favorable verdict, the attorney receives the fee from the recovery.The attorney's permitted fee varies depending on the country, and even local jurisdictions..For example, in the U.S.a contingency fee is based on the contractual agreement between the attorney and the party.The fee is calculated as a share of the eventual damage judgment or settlement obtained by the client.The percentage allowable as a contingency fee is subject to the ethical rules of professional conduct that require legal fees to be reasonable and, in some circumstances, by statutory limitations.[4] In some jurisdictions, contingent fees as high as 33% to 45% of recovery may be deemed reasonable.Attorneys charging unreasonable fees may be subject to professional sanctions..In the alternative, the contingency may come in the form of an additional charge that is added to a negotiated attorney fee in the event of success as defined by the parties in their fee contract.\nQ: what

use, it can refer variously to a gathering of all of an institution's alumni, to a ceremony at the start of the academic year to welcome incoming students, and to a graduation ceremony (sometimes otherwise known as a commencement)..A synodical assembly of a church is at times called \"Convocation\".The Convocations of Canterbury and York were the synodical assemblies of the two Provinces of the Church of England until the Church Assembly was established in 1920.[1] Their origins date back to the end of the seventh century when Theodore of Tarsus (Archbishop of Canterbury, 668-690) reorganized the structures of the English Church and established a national synod of bishops.With the recognition of York as a separate province in 733, this synod was divided into two.[1] In 1225, representatives of the cathedral and monastic chapters were included for the first time and in 1285 the membership of the Convocation of Canterbury assumed the basic form which it retained till 1921: Bishops, Abbots (till the 1530s and the Dissolution of the Monasteries), Deans, and Archdeacons, plus one representative of each cathedral chapter and two for the clergy from each diocese.[1] By the fifteenth century, each convocation was divided into an upper house (the Bishops) and a lower house (the remaining members).[1] In 1921, the number of proctors (elected representatives) of the diocesan clergy was increased to make them a majority in the lower houses..The Convocation of York was a relatively small part of the Church in England and Wales with only five member dioceses in Henry VIII's reign.[a] In 1462 it decided that all the provincial constitutions [b] of Canterbury which were not repugnant or prejudicial to its own should be allowed in the Northern Province[2] and by 1530 the Archbishop of York rarely attended sessions and the custom that York waited to see what Canterbury had decided and either accepted or rejected it was well established.The Convocation of York was, in practice, taking second place to that of Canterbury[2] so much so that in 1852 the Archbishop of York Thomas Musgrave stated that since the time of Henry VIII the archbishop had only attended personally two sessions (in 1689 and 1708).[2].The legislative powers of the convocations varied considerably over the centuries.Until 1664, they (not Parliament) determined the taxes to be paid by the clergy, but their powers in general were severely curtailed by Henry VIII in 1532/4;[c] and from the time of the Reformation till 1965 they were summoned and dissolved at the same time as Parliament.[1] Under Henry VIII and his successor Edward VI between 1534 and 1553 the Convocations were used as a source of clerical opinion but ecclesiastical legislation was secured by statute from Parliament.[3] Later between 1559 and 1641, Elizabeth I, James I and Charles I gave the force of law to decisions of Convocation without recourse to Parliament by letters patent under the great seal notably the Thirty-Nine Articles (1571) and the 141 Canons of 1603.[3].The Convocations were abolished during the Commonwealth but restored on the accession of Charles II in 1660 and they synodically approved the Book of Common Prayer which was imposed by the Act of Uniformity in 1662.[4] Formal sessions at the start of each parliament continued but no real business was discussed until after the Revolution of 1688 which brought William III and Mary II to the throne when attempts to include some of the Protestant dissenters met such resistance in the lower house that the government abandoned them and the Convocations resumed their purely formal meetings[4].In 1697 Francis Atterbury published his Letter to a Convocation Man concerning the Rights, Powers and Privileges of that Body which, in essence, claimed that the Convocation was an estate of the realm like Parliament and that the lower clergy were being illegally disfranchised and denied its proper voice in government.[5] Business was resumed in 1701 and by the time Queen Anne died in 1714 draft canons and forms of service had been drawn up for royal assent.[4] However, there was an inherent tension between the two houses, the lower house was mainly Tory in its politics and high church in its doctrine while the upper house was mainly Whig and latitudinarian and therefore in favour of toleration for Protestant dissenters and their possible reincorporation into the Church of England and feelings ran high until in 1717 the session was prorogued by Royal Writ to avoid the censuring of Bishop Benjamin Hoadly by the lower house (see the Bangorian controversy) and with the exception of an abortive session in 1741 the Convocations met only for formal business at the beginning of each parliament until the middle of the nineteenth century when Canterbury (in 1852) and York (in 1861) began to discuss issues of the day..The resumption of proper business was brought about by the political changes which had taken place some twenty years earlier.\nQ: what is a college convocation\nReasoning: A Convocation ( Latin 'calling together', translating the Greek ecclesia ) is a group of people formally assembled for a

include a bearing at the contact point, to reduce wear and friction at the contact point..In the typical use-case of an overhead valve (pushrod) engine, the camshaft at the bottom of the engine pushes the pushrod upwards.The top of the pushrod presses upwards on one side of the rocker arm (located at the top of the engine), which causes the rocker arm to rotate.This rotation causes the other end of the rocker arm to press downwards on the top of the valve, which opens the valve by moving it downwards..A roller rocker is a rocker arm that uses needle bearings (or a single bearing ball in older engines) at the contact point between the rocker and the valve, instead of metal sliding on metal.This reduces friction, uneven wear and \"bell-mouthing\" of the valve guide.[1] Roller rockers can also be used in overhead cam engines.However, these generally have the roller at the point where the cam lobe contacts the rocker, rather than at the point where the rocker contacts the valve

the great apes.This process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism, dexterity and complex language,[1] as well as interbreeding with other hominins (a tribe of the African hominid subfamily),[2] indicating that human evolution was not linear but weblike.[3][4][5][6] The study of human evolution involves several scientific disciplines, including physical and evolutionary anthropology, paleontology, and genetics.[7][8].Primates diverged from other mammals about 85million years ago (mya), in the Late Cretaceous period, with their earliest fossils appearing over 55mya, during the Paleocene.[9] Primates produced successive clades leading to the ape superfamily, which gave rise to the hominid and the gibbon families; these diverged some 15\u201320mya.African and Asian hominids (including orangutans) diverged about 14mya.Hominins (including the Australopithecine and Panina subtribes) parted from the Gorillini tribe (gorillas) between 8\u20139mya; Australopithecine (including the extinct biped ancestors of humans) separated from the Pan genus (containing chimpanzees and bonobos) 4\u20137mya.[10] The Homo genus is evidenced by the appearance of H.habilis over 2mya,[a] while anatomically modern humans emerged in Africa approximately 300,000 years ago..The evolutionary history of primates can be traced back 65million years.[11][12][13][14][15] One of the oldest known primate-like mammal species, the Plesiadapis, came from North America;[16][17][18][19][20][21] another, Archicebus, came from China.[22] Other similar basal primates were widespread in Eurasia and Africa during the tropical conditions of the Paleocene and Eocene..David R.Begun[23] concluded that early primates flourished in Eurasia and that a lineage leading to the African apes and humans, including to Dryopithecus, migrated south from Europe or Western Asia into Africa.The surviving tropical population of primates\u2014which is seen most completely in the Upper Eocene and lowermost Oligocene fossil beds of the Faiyum depression southwest of Cairo\u2014gave rise to all extant primate species, including the lemurs of Madagascar, lorises of Southeast Asia, galagos or \"bush babies\" of Africa, and to the anthropoids, which are the Platyrrhines or New World monkeys, the Catarrhines or Old World monkeys, and the great apes, including humans and other hominids..The earliest known catarrhine is Kamoyapithecus from the uppermost Oligocene at Eragaleit in the northern Great Rift Valley in Kenya, dated to 24million years ago.[24] Its ancestry is thought to be species related to Aegyptopithecus, Propliopithecus, and Parapithecus from the Faiyum, at around 35mya.[25] In 2010, Saadanius was described as a close relative of the last common ancestor of the crown catarrhines, and tentatively dated to 29\u201328mya, helping to fill an 11-million-year gap in the fossil record.[26].In the Early Miocene, about 22million years ago, the many kinds of arboreally adapted primitive catarrhines from East Africa suggest a long history of prior diversification.Fossils at 20million years ago include fragments attributed to Victoriapithecus, the earliest

Jewish,[2] and has a mother and one sister; her father is dead.[3] She began dreaming of becoming a doctor when she was 12, graduated from medical school at age 25 as second best in her class, and became the first female and second youngest Dean of Medicine at the age of 32 (she was actually 29 but she added three years to her age in order to seem more mature to the Selection Committee).[4] Cuddy attended the University of Michigan, where she first met Gregory House (Hugh Laurie),[4] and with whom she shared a one-night stand.[5].After hiring House to run the hospital's Diagnostics Department, Cuddy began setting aside $50,000 a year from the hospital's budget for potential legal expenses.[6] When, during Season 1, the new Chairman of the Board Edward Vogler (Chi McBride) tries to have House fired for refusing to kowtow to his demands, Cuddy urges the board to save House and remove Vogler instead, losing the $100 million donation he had made to the hospital.[7] In Season 2, it is revealed that Cuddy is trying to conceive a child.[8] House agrees to administer the twice-daily injections necessary for her to undergo in-vitro fertilization and to keep the matter secret.[9] In Season 3, Cuddy confesses to the hospital's Head of Oncology and House's best friend Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) that she has made a total of three attempts at impregnation, one of which was miscarried.She is hurt when House, who was going through Vicodin withdrawal, tells her it is a good thing she has failed to become a mother, as she would suck at it.[10] When House's career is threatened by Detective Michael Tritter (David Morse), Cuddy falsifies documents and perjures herself in court to cover up his wrongdoing.[1].Cuddy questions whether House has a romantic interest in her when he interrupts her repeatedly during a blind date.[11] When Wilson takes Cuddy to the theatre[12] and later to an art exhibition, House intervenes in an attempt to prevent Cuddy from becoming Wilson's fourth wife.[13] In Season 5, Cuddy reveals that she is adopting a baby girl, to be named Joy,[14] and then is devastated when the birth-mother decides to keep the baby.House consoles her, and the two share a passionate kiss.[15] Cuddy professes not to want a relationship with House but is touched when he has her old desk from medical school brought out of storage for her when her office is renovated.[16] In episode \"Joy to the World\", Cuddy becomes a foster mother and potential adoptive mother to a baby girl she names Rachel.[17] She initially struggles with motherhood, revealing to Wilson that she feels nothing for Rachel but soon begins to bond with her.[18] In episode \"Under My Skin\", Cuddy helps House detox from Vicodin; and the two sleep together.[19] In the following episode, the Season 5 finale \"Both Sides Now\", this is revealed to have been a hallucination on House's part: in reality, he spent the evening alone and is suffering from psychiatric problems as a result of Vicodin and emotional trauma.[20].Throughout Season 6, Cuddy is busy with her adopted daughter and is in a relationship with a private investigator, Lucas, who was hired by House to spy on Wilson at the start of Season 5.She cared for House after he goes through rehab for Vicodin.After sensing romantic feelings from House, Cuddy tells House that she would like to be

gametophytes, which in flowering plants consist of a few haploid cells that produce gametes.The \"male\" gametophyte, which produces non-motile sperm, is enclosed within pollen grains; the \"female\" gametophyte is contained within the ovule.When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination.Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from the same flower or a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species..Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma.This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[1].Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy).Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop..Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.[2] In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one another\u2014in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.[3] After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds..Flowers have long been appreciated by humans

who had been sent to scout the city prior to their attack.[2] In the New Testament, she is lauded both as an example of a saint who lived by faith,[3] and as someone \"considered righteous\" for her

Canaanite religion, although recent scholarship has disputed this.[8] However, there was a separate word, q\u01ddd\u0113\u0161\u00e2, that could be used to designate ritual prostitutes.[8].Josephus mentions that Rahab kept an inn but is silent as to whether merely renting out rooms was her only source of income.[11] It was not uncommon for both an inn and a brothel to operate within the same building; thus entering Rahab's quarters was not necessarily a deviation from Joshua's orders.Indeed, as Robert Boling notes, such an establishment might have represented an ideal location for spies to gather intelligence.[8] A number of scholars have noted that the narrator in Joshua 2 may have intended to remind the readers of the \"immemorial symbiosis between military service and bawdy house\".[8].In the Christian New Testament, the Epistle of James and the Epistle to the Hebrews follow the tradition set by the translators of the Septuagint in using the Greek word \"\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\" (p\u00f3rn\u0113, which is usually translated to English as \"harlot\" or \"prostitute\") to describe Rahab.[12][13][14].William L.Lyons observed that biblical interpreters have viewed Rahab as a model of hospitality, mercy, faith, patience, and repentance in her interaction with Joshua's spies.Thus the harlot of Jericho became a paragon of virtue.[15].According to the book of Joshua,[16] when the Hebrews were encamped at Shittim in the Arabah or Jordan Valley opposite Jericho, ready to cross the river, Joshua, as a final preparation, sent out two spies to investigate the military strength of Jericho.\nQ: what is a harlot in the bible\nReasoning: Rahab of Jericho"}, {"question_id": "Q1337", "question": "what are the goals of the

States, the OAS is a \"multilateral regional body focused on human rights, electoral oversight, social and economic development, and security in the Western Hemisphere\", according to the Council on Foreign Relations.[2] As of June 2023, 35 states in the Americas are OAS members.[3][4].Luis Almagro of Uruguay was inaugurated as OAS secretary general in 2015.[5][6].The notion of an international union in the New World was first put forward during the liberation of the Americas by Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar[7] who, at the 1826 Congress of Panama (still being part of Colombia), proposed creating a league of American republics, with a common military, a mutual defense pact, and a supranational parliamentary assembly.This meeting was attended by representatives of Gran Colombia (comprising the modern-day countries of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Venezuela), Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, The United Provinces of Central America, and Mexico but the grandly titled \"Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation\" was ultimately ratified only by Gran Colombia.Bol\u00edvar's dream soon floundered with civil war in Gran Colombia, the disintegration of Central America, and the emergence of national rather than New World outlooks in the newly independent American republics.Bol\u00edvar's dream of inter-American unity was meant to unify Hispanic American nations against external powers..The pursuit of regional solidarity and cooperation again came to the forefront in 1889\u20131890, at the First International Conference of American States.Gathered together in Washington, D.C., 18 nations resolved to found the International Union of American Republics, served by a permanent secretariat called the Commercial Bureau of the American Republics (renamed the International Commercial Bureau at the Second International Conference in 1901\u20131902).These two bodies, in existence as of 14 April 1890, represent the point of inception to which the OAS and its General Secretariat trace their origins..At the fourth International Conference of American States (Buenos Aires, 1910), the name of the organization was changed to the Union of

for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both.This is in contrast to the previous concept of highly reliable mainframe disk drives referred to as \"single large expensive disk\" (SLED).[3][1].Data is distributed across the drives in one of several ways, referred to as RAID levels, depending on the required level of redundancy and performance.The different schemes, or data distribution layouts, are named by the word \"RAID\" followed by a number, for example RAID0 or RAID1.Each scheme, or RAID level, provides a different balance among the key goals: reliability, availability, performance, and capacity.RAID levels greater than RAID0 provide protection against unrecoverable sector read errors, as well as against failures of whole physical drives..The term \"RAID\" was invented by David Patterson, Garth A.Gibson, and Randy Katz at the University of California, Berkeley in 1987.In their June 1988 paper \"A Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks

which natural killer cells are an important subtype (which functions in cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity).They are the main type of cell found in lymph, which prompted the name \"lymphocyte\" (with cyte meaning cell).[4] Lymphocytes make up between 18% and 42% of circulating white blood cells.[2].The three major types of lymphocyte are T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells.[2] Lymphocytes can be identified by their large nucleus..T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow- or bursa-derived cells[a]) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response.T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies).The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific \"non-self\" antigens, during a process known as antigen presentation.Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored maximally to eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells.B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses.In response to pathogens some T cells, called T helper cells, produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called cytotoxic T cells, produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells.Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of memory cells.Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will \"remember\" each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired immunity..NK cells are a part of the innate immune system and play a major role in defending the host from tumors and virally infected cells.[2] NK cells modulate the functions of other cells,

trophoblast cells that are surrounding a growing embryo (syncytiotrophoblast initially), which eventually forms the placenta after implantation.[1][2] The presence of hCG is detected in some pregnancy tests (HCG pregnancy strip tests).Some cancerous tumors produce this hormone; therefore, elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant may lead to a cancer diagnosis and, if high enough, paraneoplastic syndromes, however, it is not known whether this production is a contributing cause, or an effect of carcinogenesis.The pituitary analog of hCG, known as luteinizing hormone (LH), is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages.[1][3].Various endogenous forms of hCG exist.The measurement of these diverse forms is used in the diagnosis of pregnancy and a variety of disease states.[1] Preparations of hCG from various sources have also been used therapeutically, by both medicine and quackery.As of December6, 2011[update], the United States Food and Drug Administration has prohibited the sale of \"homeopathic\" and over-the-counter hCG diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal.[4][5][6].Beta-hCG is initially secreted by the

"Context: Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person.The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms (kg) and height in metres (m)..The BMI may be determined first by measuring its components by means of a weighing scale and a stadiometer.The multiplication and division may be carried out directly, by hand or using a calculator, or indirectly using a lookup table (or chart).[a] The table displays BMI as a function of mass and height and may show other units of measurement (converted to metric units for the calculation).[b] The table may also show contour lines or colours for different BMI categories..The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height.Major adult BMI classifications are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese (30 or more).[1]  When used to predict an individual's health, rather than as a statistical measurement for groups, the BMI has limitations that can make it less useful than some of the alternatives, especially when applied to individuals with abdominal obesity, short stature, or high muscle mass..BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-cause mortality, with the risk increasing with distance from the 20\u201325 range.[2].Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician, and sociologist, devised the basis of the BMI between 1830 and 1850 as he developed what he called \"social physics\".[3] Quetelet himself never intended for the index, then called the Quetelet Index, to be used as a means of medical assessment.Instead, it was a component of his study of l'homme moyen, or the average man.Quetelet thought of the average man as a social ideal, and developed the body mass index as a means of discovering the socially ideal human person.[4] According to Lars Grue and Arvid Heiberg in the Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research, Quetelet's idealization of the average man would be elaborated upon by Francis Galton a decade later in the development of Eugenics.[5].The modern term \"body mass index\" (BMI) for the ratio of human body weight to squared height was coined in a paper published in the July 1972 edition of the Journal of Chronic Diseases by Ancel Keys and others.In this paper, Keys argued that what he termed the BMI was \"if not fully satisfactory, at least as good as any other relative weight index as an

is a biblical interpretation which was originally derived from a phrase which is contained in the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:31\u201334), in the Hebrew Bible (or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible)..Generally, Christians believe that the promised New Covenant was instituted at the Last Supper as part of the Eucharist,[1][2] which, in the Gospel of John, includes the New Commandment.Based on the biblical passage which reads that, \"For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth\",[3] Protestants tend to believe that the New Covenant only came into force with the death of Jesus Christ.[4][5] The commentary to the Roman Catholic New American Bible also affirms that Christ is the \"testator whose death puts his will into effect\".[6] Thus, Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant, and they also believe that the blood of Christ, which was shed during his crucifixion, is the only blood sacrifice which is required by the covenant..There are several Christian eschatologies that further define the New Covenant.For example, an inaugurated eschatology defines and describes the New Covenant as an ongoing relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the Second Coming of Christ; that is, it will not only be in full fruition in believing hearts, it will also be in fruition in the future external world.The description of the connection between the blood of Christ and the New Covenant is contained in most modern English translations of the New Testament such as the passage which reads: \"this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood\".[7][8].The key New Testament chapter for the Christian concept of the New Covenant is Hebrews chapter 8, a portion of which is quoted below:.But now Jesus has obtained a superior ministry, since the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted on better promises.For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second.For he finds fault with them when he says: \"Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt.For they did not continue in my covenant, and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord.\nQ: what are new covenant church\nReasoning: The New Covenant ( Hebrew \u2022 \u2022 \u2014 Greek \u2022 \u2022 diatheke kaine) is a biblical interpretation originally derived from a phrase in

impeachment process: \"The president shall ...have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\".[1].Though pardons have been challenged in the courts, and the power to grant them challenged by Congress, the courts have consistently declined to put limits on the president's discretion.The president can issue a full pardon, reversing a criminal conviction (along with its legal effects) as if it never happened.A pardon can be issued from the time an offense is committed, and can even be issued after the full sentence has been

photosynthesis is a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and hydrogen-carrier compounds into glucose.The Calvin cycle is present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and also many photosynthetic bacteria.In plants, these reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled region of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes.These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them.The Calvin cycle  uses the chemical energy of ATP and reducing power of NADPH from the light dependent reactions to produce sugars for the plant to use.These substrates are used in a series of reduction-oxidation reactions to produce sugars in a step-wise process; there is no direct reaction that converts several molecules of CO2 to a sugar.There are three phases to the light-independent reactions, collectively called the Calvin cycle: carboxylation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration..Though it is called the \"dark reaction\", the Calvin cycle does not actually occur in the dark or during night time.This is because the process requires NADPH, which is short-lived and comes from the light-dependent reactions.In the dark, plants instead release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves to provide energy for the plant.The Calvin cycle thus happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis (C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation, and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM)); CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day to make this process work.[2].The reactions of the Calvin cycle are closely coupled to the thylakoid electron transport chain as the energy required to reduce the carbon dioxide is

the Wii U, support the Wii MotionPlus accessory in  games..The accessory was first released in June 2009.A later hardware revision of the Wii Remote, the Wii Remote Plus, was later released with the Wii MotionPlus technology built-in..The Wii MotionPlus was announced by Nintendo in a press release on July 14, 2008,[4] and revealed the next day at a press conference at the E3 Media & Business Summit.It was released in June 2009.[3][1] On May 3, 2010, Nintendo announced that starting May 9, 2010, the company would include its Wii Sports Resort game and MotionPlus controller with new consoles with no price increase.[5].The Wii MotionPlus was developed by Nintendo in collaboration with game development tool company AiLive.[6] The sensor used is an InvenSense IDG-600[7] or IDG-650 in later units, designed in accordance to Nintendo's specification;[8][9] with a high dynamic range, high mechanical shock tolerance, high temperature and humidity resistance, and small physical size.[10][11].The Wii MotionPlus was conceived soon after the completion of the initial Wii Remote design, to address developer demand for more capable motion sensing, but was only announced after the sensors could be purchased in sufficient volume at a reasonable price.[12][13] During a developer round table discussion at E3 2008, Wii Sports Resort producer Katsuya Eguchi discussed the potential influence of the Wii MotionPlus on the Wii's existing market, stating that Nintendo was looking at whether the MotionPlus capability will be built into the Wii Remote in the future, or kept \"as an attachment we only use for certain software.\"[14]  Nintendo ultimately chose the former by releasing the Wii Remote Plus in late 2010..From June to August 2009, Club Nintendo in Japan held a contest wherein members who purchased and registered a copy of Wii Sports Resort would be entered into a draw to win a sky blue Wii MotionPlus in one of 5,000 blue controller sets.[15][16] In November 2009, a black Wii MotionPlus was released to coincide with the release of the black Wii console.Bundles containing a black Wii Remote and MotionPlus attachment were also released.In North America, non-white Wii Remotes are bundled with a MotionPlus of matching color for black Wii Remotes and a white MotionPlus unit with a translucent jacket for blue and pink Wii Remotes.\nQ: what is a wii motion

"Context: \"Majulah Singapura\"[a] is the national anthem of the Republic of Singapore.Composed by Zubir Said in 1958 as a theme song for official functions of the City Council of Singapore, the song was selected in 1959 as the nation's anthem when it attained self-government.Upon full independence in 1965, \"Majulah Singapura\" was formally adopted as Singapore's national anthem.By law, the anthem must be sung with Malay lyrics, but there are authorised translations of the lyrics of the anthem in Singapore's three other official languages: English, Mandarin and Tamil.[1][2].The national anthem is regularly performed or sung in schools and armed forces camps at ceremonies held at the beginning and/or the end of each day, during which the national flag is also raised and lowered and the national pledge is taken.Singaporeans are especially encouraged to sing the national anthem on occasions of national celebration or national significance such as at the National Day Parade, at National Day observance ceremonies conducted by educational institutions and government departments and at sporting events at which Singapore teams are participating..Originally composed in the key of G major, the national anthem was officially relaunched in 2001 in the lower key of F major as it was said to allow for a \"grander and more inspiring arrangement\"..The composition of \"Majulah Singapura\" occurred during a push for independence from the United Kingdom.While Singapore was a British colony, its national anthem was \"God Save the King (or Queen)\".In 1951, the colony was conferred city status by a royal charter from King George VI.In 1958, Ong Pang Boon, the Deputy Mayor of the City Council of Singapore, approached Zubir Said, a score arranger and songwriter with Cathay-Keris Film Productions, to compose a theme song for the Council's official functions to be titled \"Majulah Singapura\" (Malay for \"Onward Singapore\").This phrase was chosen as it was a motto to be displayed in the Victoria Theatre after its renovation in 1958.[3][4].\nQ: who composed the Singapore national anthem\nReasoning: Majulah Singapura (Onward Singapore) is the national anthem of

"input": "Context: Shipbuilding is the construction of ships and other floating vessels.It normally takes place in a specialized facility known as a shipyard.Shipbuilders, also called shipwrights, follow a specialized occupation that traces its roots to before recorded history..Until recently, with the development of complex non-maritime technologies, a ship has often represented the most advanced structure that the society building it could produce.[1]:\u200ach1\u200a Some key industrial advances were developed to support shipbuilding, for instance the sawing of timbers by mechanical saws propelled by windmills in Dutch shipyards during the first half of the 17th century.[a][2]:\u200a34\u201337\u200a The design process saw the early adoption of the logarithm (invented in 1615) to generate the curves used to produce the shape of a hull, especially when scaling up these curves accurately in the mould loft.[1].Shipbuilding and ship repairs, both commercial and military, are referred to as \"naval engineering\".The construction of boats is a similar activity called boat building..The dismantling of ships is called ship breaking..The earliest evidence of maritime transport by modern humans is the settlement of Australia between 50,000 and  60,000 years ago.This almost certainly involved rafts, possibly equipped with some sort of sail.[3]:\u200a29,\u200a33\u200a Much of the development beyond that raft technology occurred  in the \"nursery\" areas of the Mediterranean and in Island Southeast Asia.Favoured by warmer waters and a number of inter-visible islands, boats (and, later, ships) with water-tight hulls (unlike the \"flow through\" structure of a raft) could be developed.[4]:\u200a113\u200a[5]:\u200a7,\u200a63\u200a The ships of ancient Egypt were built by joining the hull planks together, edge to edge, with tenons set in mortices cut in the mating edges.A similar technique, but with the tenons being pinned in position by dowels was used in the Mediterranean for most of Classical antiquity.Both these variants are \"shell first\" techniques, where any reinforcing frames are inserted after assembly of the planking has defined the hull shape.[5]:\u200a81-88\u200a Carvel construction then took over in the Mediterranean.\nQ: who built the first ship\nReasoning: An expedition's shipwrights building a brigantine , 1541."},

the Solar System found by mathematical predictions rather than by empirical observation.Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to

subsequently observed with a telescope on 23September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier.Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter,

respiration", "answer": "Typical eukaryotic cell .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Cellular respiration is the process by which biological fuels are oxidized in the presence of an inorganic electron acceptor, such as oxygen, to drive the bulk production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which contains energy.Cellular respiration may be described as a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from nutrients into ATP, and then release waste products.[1].Cellular respiration is a vital process that happens in the cells of living organisms, including humans, plants, and animals.It's how cells produce energy to power all the activities necessary for life..The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, producing large amounts of energy (ATP).Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity.The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions.Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it is an unusual one because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions..Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent is molecular oxygen (O2).The chemical energy stored in ATP (the bond of its third phosphate group to the rest of the molecule can be broken allowing more stable products to form, thereby releasing energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes..Aerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP.Although carbohydrates, fats and proteins  are consumed as reactants, aerobic respiration is the preferred method of pyruvate production in glycolysis, and requires pyruvate to the mitochondria in order to be fully oxidized by the citric acid cycle.\nQ: where does cellular respiration occur\nReasoning: Typical eukaryotic cell ."}, {"question_id":

Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 \u2013 c.April 5, 1994) was an American musician who was the co-founder, lead vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter of the rock band Nirvana.Through his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain's compositions widened the thematic conventions of mainstream rock.He was heralded as a spokesman of Generation X and is highly recognized as one of the most influential alternative rock musicians..Cobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene that later became known as grunge.After signing with DGC Records, Nirvana found commercial success with the single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" from their critically acclaimed second album Nevermind (1991).Although Cobain was hailed as the voice of his generation following Nirvana's sudden success, he resented this, believing his message and artistic vision had been misinterpreted by the public.In addition to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", Cobain wrote many other hit songs for Nirvana, including \"Come as You Are\", \"Lithium\", \"In Bloom\", \"Something in the Way\", \"Heart-Shaped Box\", \"All Apologies\", \"About a Girl\", \"Aneurysm\",[1] and \"You Know You're Right\".[2].During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with a heroin addiction and chronic health problems such as depression.[3] He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame, and he had a tumultuous relationship with his wife, fellow musician Courtney Love.[4] In March 1994, Cobain overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol, and he subsequently entered an intervention and underwent a detox program.On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home at the age of 27;[5] police concluded he had died on April 5 from a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head..Cobain was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, in their first year of eligibility in 2014.Rolling Stone included Cobain in its lists of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, 100 Greatest

movement in the 19th century and the feminist movements during the 20th and 21st centuries.In some countries, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior, whereas in others, they are ignored and suppressed.They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls, in favor of men and boys.[1].Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include the right to bodily integrity and autonomy, to be free from sexual violence, to vote, to hold public office, to enter into legal contracts, to have equal rights in family law, to work, to fair wages or equal pay, to have reproductive rights, to own property, and to education.[2].Women in ancient Sumer could buy, own, sell, and inherit property.[3] They could engage in commerce,[3] and testify in court as witnesses.[3] Nonetheless, their husbands could divorce them for mild infractions,[3] and a divorced husband could easily remarry another woman, provided that his first wife had borne him no offspring.[3] Female deities, such as Inanna, were widely worshipped.[4]:\u200a182\u200a The Akkadian poet Enheduanna, the priestess of Inanna and daughter of Sargon, is the earliest known poet whose name has been recorded.[5] Old Babylonian law codes permitted a husband to divorce his wife under any circumstances,[4]:\u200a140\u200a but doing so required him to return all of her property and sometimes pay her a fine.[4]:\u200a140\u200a Most law codes forbade a woman to request her husband for a divorce and enforced the same penalties on a woman asking for divorce as on a woman caught in the act of adultery.[4]:\u200a140\u200a Some Babylonian and Assyrian laws, however, afforded women the same right to divorce as men, requiring them to pay the same fine.[4]:\u200a140\u200a The majority of East Semitic deities were male.[4]:\u200a179.In ancient Egypt, women enjoyed the same rights under the law as a man, however rightful entitlements depended upon social class.Landed property descended in the female line from mother to daughter, and women were entitled to administer their own property.Women in ancient Egypt could buy, sell, be a partner in legal contracts, be executors in wills and witnesses to legal documents, bring court action, and adopt children.[6].Women during the early Vedic period[7] enjoyed equal status with men in all aspects of life.[8] Works by ancient Indian grammarians such as Patanjali and Katyayana suggest that women were educated in the early Vedic period.[9][10] Rigvedic verses suggest that women married at a mature age and were probably free to select their own husbands in a practice called swayamvar or live-in relationship called Gandharva marriage.[11].Although most women lacked political and equal rights in the city states of ancient Greece, they enjoyed a certain freedom of movement until the Archaic age.[12] Records also exist of women in ancient Delphi, Gortyn, Thessaly, Megara, and Sparta owning land, the most prestigious form of private property at the time.[13] However, after the Archaic age, legislators began to enact laws enforcing gender segregation, resulting in decreased rights for women.[12].Women in Classical Athens had no legal personhood and were assumed to be part of the oikos headed by the male kyrios.\nQ: when did women get the right to own property\nReasoning: Women's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls of many

ejection fraction (EF) represents the volumetric fraction of blood pumped out of the ventricle (heart) with each heart beat or cardiac cycle .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: An ejection fraction (EF) is the volumetric fraction (or portion of the total) of fluid (usually blood) ejected from a chamber (usually the heart) with each contraction (or heartbeat).It can refer to the cardiac atrium,[1] ventricle,[2] gall bladder,[3] or leg veins,[4] although if unspecified it usually refers to the left ventricle of the heart.EF is widely used as a measure of the pumping efficiency of the heart and is used to classify heart failure types.It is also used as an indicator of the severity of heart failure, although it has recognized limitations.[5].The EF of the left heart, known as the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), is calculated by dividing the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle per beat (stroke volume) by the volume of blood present in the left ventricle at the end of diastolic filling (end-diastolic volume).LVEF is an indicator of the effectiveness of pumping into the systemic circulation.The EF of the right heart, or right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), is a measure of the efficiency of pumping into the pulmonary circulation.A heart which cannot pump sufficient blood to meet the body's requirements (i.e., heart failure) will often, but not invariably, have a reduced ventricular ejection fraction.[6].In heart failure, the difference between heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, and heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction, is significant, because the two types are treated differently..Modalities applied to measurement of ejection fraction is an emerging field of medical mathematics and subsequent computational applications.The first common measurement method is echocardiography,[7][8] although cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),[8][9] cardiac computed tomography,[8][9] ventriculography and nuclear medicine (gated SPECT and radionuclide angiography)[8][10] scans may also be used.Measurements by different modalities are not easily interchangeable.[11] Historically, the gold standard for measurement of the ejection fraction was ventriculography,[12] but cardiac MRI is now considered the best method.[13] Prior to these more advanced techniques, the combination of electrocardiography and phonocardiography was used to accurately estimate ejection fraction.[14].\nQ: what is a normal ejection fraction\nReasoning: In cardiovascular physiology , ejection fraction (EF) represents the

(leukocyte) in the immune system of most vertebrates.[1] Lymphocytes include T cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity), B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity),[2][3] and Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) (\"innate T cell-like\" cells involved in mucosal immunity and homeostasis), of which natural killer cells are an important subtype (which functions in cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity).They are the main type of cell found in lymph, which prompted the name \"lymphocyte\" (with cyte meaning cell).[4] Lymphocytes make up between 18% and 42% of circulating white blood cells.[2].The three major types of lymphocyte are T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells.[2] Lymphocytes can be identified by their large nucleus..T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow- or bursa-derived cells[a]) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response.T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies).The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific \"non-self\" antigens, during a process known as antigen presentation.Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored maximally to eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells.B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses.In response to pathogens some T cells, called T helper cells, produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called cytotoxic T cells, produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells.Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of memory cells.Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will \"remember\" each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired immunity..NK cells are a part of the innate immune system and play a major role in defending the host from tumors and virally infected cells.[2] NK cells modulate the functions of other cells, including macrophages and T cells,[2] and distinguish infected cells and tumors from normal and uninfected cells by recognizing changes of a surface molecule called MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I.\nQ: What to do for low lymphocyte count\nReasoning: A

The Latin adverb sic (pronounced [s\u026ak]; \"thus\", \"just as\"; in full: sic erat scriptum, \"thus was it written\")[1] inserted after a quoted word or passage indicates that the quoted matter has been transcribed or translated exactly as found in the source text, complete with any erroneous, archaic, or otherwise nonstandard spelling, punctuation, or grammar.It also applies to any surprising assertion, faulty reasoning, or other matter that might be interpreted as an error of transcription..The typical usage is to inform the reader that any errors or apparent errors in quoted material do not arise from errors in the course of the transcription, but are intentionally reproduced, exactly as they appear in the source text.It is generally placed inside square brackets to indicate that it is not part of the quoted matter..Sic may also be inserted derisively or sarcastically, to call attention to the original writer's spelling mistakes or erroneous logic, or to show general disapproval or dislike of the material.[2].Though occasionally misidentified as an abbreviated word, sic is a Latin adverb used in English as an adverb, and, derivatively, as a noun and a verb.[3] The adverb sic, meaning \"intentionally so written\", first appeared in English c.\u20091856.[4] It is derived from the Latin adverb s\u012bc, which means \"so, thus, in this manner\".[5] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the verbal form of sic, meaning \"to mark with a sic\", emerged in 1889, E.Belfort Bax's work in The Ethics of Socialism being an early example.[6].On occasion, sic has been misidentified as an acronym (and therefore sometimes misspelled with periods): \"s.i.c.\" is said to stand for \"spelled/said in context\", \"said in copy\", \"spelling is correct\", \"spelled incorrectly\", and other such folk etymology phrases.[7] These are all incorrect and are simply backronyms from sic..Use of sic greatly increased in the mid-20th century.[8] For example, in United States state-court opinions before 1944, sic appeared 1,239 times in the Westlaw database; in those from 1945 to 1990, it appeared 69,168 times, over 55 times as many.[2] Its use as a form of ridicule has been cited as a major factor in this increase.[2] The immoderate use of sic has created some controversy, leading some editors, including bibliographical scholar Simon Nowell-Smith and literary critic Leon Edel, to speak out against it.[9].Sic, in its bracketed form, is most often inserted into quoted or reprinted material to indicate meticulous accuracy in reproducing the preceding text, despite appearances to the reader of an incorrect or unusual orthography (spelling, punctuation, grammar, syntax, fact, logic, etc.).[2][10] Several usage guides recommend that a bracketed sic be used primarily as an aid to the reader, not as an indicator of disagreement with the source.[2][11].Sic may show that an uncommon or archaic expression is reported faithfully,[12] such as when quoting the U.S.Constitution: \"The House of Representatives shall chuse [sic] their Speaker ...\" However, several writing guidebooks discourage its use with regard to dialect, such as in cases of American and

students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students.Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities.Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old (or older), except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age limit is 14 years.[6] As of December2022[update], Facebook claimed 3billion monthly active users.[7] As of October 2023 Facebook ranked as the 3rd most visited website in the world with 22.56% of its traffic coming from the United States.[8][9] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[10].Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones.After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves.They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their \"friend\" or, with different privacy settings, publicly.Users can also communicate directly with each other with Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow..The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S.elections) and mass surveillance.[11] Facebook has also been subject to criticism over psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and various controversies over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech.[12] Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content, as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.[13].Zuckerberg built a website called \"Facemash\" in 2003 while attending Harvard University.The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used \"photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the \"hotter\" person\".[15] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.[16] The site was sent to several campus group listservs,

information in a digital format.[1] These records can be shared across different health care settings.Records are shared through network-connected, enterprise-wide information systems or other information networks and exchanges.EHRs may include a range of data, including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics like age and weight, and billing information.[2].For several decades, electronic health records (EHRs) have been touted as key to increasing of quality care.[3] Electronic health records are used for other reasons than charting for patients;[4] today, providers are using data from patient records to improve quality outcomes through their care management programs.EHR combines all patients demographics into a large pool, and uses this information to assist with the creation of \"new treatments or innovation in healthcare delivery\" which overall improves the goals in healthcare.[4] Combining multiple types of clinical data from the system's health records has helped clinicians identify and stratify chronically ill patients.EHR can improve quality care by using the data and analytics to prevent hospitalizations among high-risk patients..EHR systems are designed to store data accurately and to capture the state of a patient across time.It eliminates the need to track down a patient's previous paper medical records and assists in ensuring data is up-to-date,[5] accurate and legible.It also allows open communication between the patient and the provider, while providing \"privacy and security.\"[5] It can reduce risk of data replication as there is only one modifiable file, which means the file is more likely up to date and decreases risk of lost paperwork and is cost efficient.[5] Due to the digital information being searchable and in a single file, EMRs (electronic medical records) are more effective when extracting medical data for the examination of possible trends and long term changes in a patient.Population-based studies of medical records may also be facilitated by the widespread adoption of EHRs and EMRs..The terms EHR, electronic patient record (EPR) and EMR have often been used interchangeably, but differences between the models are now being defined.The electronic health record (EHR) is a more

water.Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.[6].Xylem also contains two other type of cells: parenchyma and fibers.[7].Xylem can be found:.In transitional stages of plants with secondary growth, the first two categories are not mutually exclusive, although usually a vascular bundle will contain primary xylem only..The branching pattern exhibited by xylem follows Murray's law.[8].Primary xylem is formed during primary growth from procambium.It includes protoxylem and metaxylem.Metaxylem develops after the protoxylem but before secondary xylem.Metaxylem has wider vessels and tracheids than protoxylem..\nQ: what produces primary xylem?\nReasoning: Schematic cross

sexual intercourse .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Fuck is an English-language profanity which often refers to the act of sexual intercourse, but is also commonly used as an intensifier or to convey disdain.While its origin is obscure, it is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475CE.[1] In modern usage, the term fuck and its derivatives (such as fucker and fucking) are used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, an interjection or an adverb.There are many common phrases that employ the word as well as compounds that incorporate it, such as motherfucker, fuckwit, fuckup, fucknut, fucktard, and fuck off..It is unclear whether the word has always been considered a pejorative or, if not, when it first came to be used to describe (often in an extremely angry, hostile or belligerent manner) unpleasant circumstances or people in an intentionally offensive way, such as in the term motherfucker, one of its more common usages in some parts of the English-speaking world.Some English-speaking countries censor it on television and radio.Andrea Millwood Hargrave's 2000 study of the attitudes of the British public found that fuck was considered the third-most-severe profanity, and its derivative motherfucker second.Cunt was considered the most severe.[2].Nevertheless, the word has increasingly become less of a pejorative and more publicly acceptable, an example of the \"dysphemism treadmill\" or semantic drift known as melioration, wherein former pejoratives become inoffensive and commonplace.[3][4] Because of its increasing usage in the public forum, in 2005 the word was included for the first time as one of three vulgarities in The Canadian Press's Canadian Press Caps and Spelling guide.Journalists were advised to refrain from censoring the word but use it sparingly and only when its inclusion was essential to the story.[5] According to linguist Pamela Hobbs, \"notwithstanding its increasing public use, enduring cultural models that inform our beliefs about the nature of sexuality and sexual acts preserve its status as a vile utterance that continues to inspire moral outrage.\" Hobbs considers users rather than usage of the word and sub-divides users into \"non-users\", for whom \"the word belongs to a set of taboo words, the very utterance of which constitutes an affront, and any use of the word, regardless of its form (verb, adjective, adverb, etc.) or meaning (literal or metaphorical) evokes the core sexual meanings and associated sexual imagery that motivate the taboo.\"; and \"users\", for whom \"metaphorical uses of the word fuck no more evoke images of sexual intercourse than a ten-year-old's 'My mom'll kill me if she finds out' evokes images of murder,\" so that the \"criteria of taboo are missing.\"[6].The Oxford English Dictionary states that the ultimate etymology is uncertain, but that the word is \"probably cognate\" with a number of Germanic words with meanings involving striking, rubbing and having sex or is derivative of the Old French word that meant 'to have sex'.[7].The word has probable cognates in other Germanic languages, such as German ficken ('to fuck'); Dutch fokken ('to breed', 'to beget'); Afrikaans fok ('to fuck');[8] Icelandic fokka ('to mess around', 'to rush');[9] dialectal Norwegian fukka ('to copulate'); and dialectal Swedish focka ('to strike', 'to copulate') and fock ('penis').[7] This points to a possible etymology where Common Germanic *fuk(k)\u014dn-from the verbal root *fug- ('to blow')[9] comes from an Indo-European root *peuk-, or *peu\u011d- ('to strike'),[10] cognate with non-Germanic words such as Latin pugno ('I fight') or pugnus ('fist').[7] By application of Grimm's law, this hypothetical root also has the Pre-Germanic form *pug-n\u00e9h2- (''to blow'),[9] which is the etymon of, amongst others, Dutch fok(zeil) ('foresail').[11] There is a theory that fuck is most likely derived from German or Dutch roots, and is probably not derived from an Old English root.[12].One reason that the word fuck is difficult to trace etymologically is that it was used far more extensively in common speech, rather than in easily traceable documents or writings.\nQ: when did the word fuck begin\nReasoning: Fuck in its literal meaning refers to the act of sexual intercourse ."}, {"question_id": "Q1926",

living.It was estimated by the United Nations to have exceeded eight billion in mid-November 2022.It took around 300,000 years of human prehistory and history for the human population to reach one billion and only 222 years more to reach 8billion.[3].The human population has experienced continuous growth following the Great Famine of 1315\u20131317 and the end of the Black Death in 1350, when it was nearly 370,000,000.[4] The highest global population growth rates, with increases of over 1.8% per year, occurred between 1955 and 1975, peaking at 2.1% between 1965 and 1970.[5] The growth rate declined to 1.1% between 2015 and 2020 and is projected to decline further in the 21st century.[6] The global population is still increasing, but there is significant uncertainty about its long-term trajectory due to changing fertility and mortality rates.[7] The UN Department of Economics and Social Affairs projects between 9 and 10billion people by 2050 and gives an 80% confidence interval of 10\u201312billion by the end of the 21st century,[2] with a growth rate by then of zero.Other demographers predict that the human population will begin to decline in the second half of the 21st century.[8].The total number of births globally is currently (2015\u20132020) 140 million/year, which is projected to peak during the period 2040\u20132045 at 141million/year and then decline slowly to 126million/year by 2100.[9] The total number of deaths is currently 57million/year and is projected to grow steadily to 121million/year by 2100.[10].The median age of human beings as of 2020[update] is 31 years.[11].Estimates of world population by their nature are an aspect of modernity, possible only since the Age of Discovery.Early estimates for the population of the world[12] date to the 17th century: William Petty, in 1682, estimated the world population at 320 million (current estimates ranging close to twice this number); by the late 18th century, estimates ranged close to one billion (consistent with current estimates).[13] More refined estimates, broken down by continents, were published in the first half of the 19th century, at 600 million to 1billion in the early 1800s and 800million to 1billion in the 1840s.[14].It is difficult for estimates to be better than rough approximations, as even current population estimates are fraught with uncertainties from 3% to 5%.[15].Estimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15million.[16][17] Even earlier, genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BC, according to the now largely discredited Toba catastrophe theory.By contrast, it is estimated that around 50\u201360million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD.[18].\nQ: what percent of kids 15 and under make up the human population\nReasoning: World

inject venom,[2] and spinnerets that extrude silk.[3] They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms.[4][5] Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every land habitat.As of August2022[update], 50,356 spider species in 132 families have been recorded by taxonomists.[1] However, there has been debate among scientists about how families should be classified, with over 20 different classifications proposed since 1900.[6].Anatomically, spiders (as with all arachnids) differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax or prosoma, and the opisthosoma, or abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel.However, as there is currently neither paleontological nor embryological evidence that spiders ever had a separate thorax-like division, there exists an argument against the validity of the term cephalothorax, which means fused cephalon (head) and the thorax.Similarly, arguments can be formed against use of the term abdomen, as the opisthosoma of all spiders contains a heart and respiratory organs, organs atypical of an abdomen.[7].Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae.In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax.Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure..Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of glands.Spider webs vary widely in size, shape and the amount of sticky thread used.It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms, and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-weaver spiders.\nQ: what type of spider has the most eyes\nReasoning: Spiders ( order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom ."}, {"question_id": "Q1989",

Massachusetts, on November 21[O.S.November 11], 1620..Differing from their contemporaries, the Puritans (who sought to reform and purify the Church of England), the Pilgrims chose to separate themselves from the Church of England, which forced them to pray in private.They believed it was beyond redemption due to its resistance to reform and Roman Catholic past.Starting in 1608, a group of English families left England for the Netherlands, where they could worship freely.By 1620, the community determined to cross the Atlantic for America, which they considered a \"new Promised Land\", where they would establish Plymouth Colony.[1]:\u200a44.The Pilgrims had originally hoped to reach America by early October using two ships, but delays and complications meant they could use only one, Mayflower.Arriving in November, they had to survive unprepared through a harsh winter.As a result, only half of the original Pilgrims survived the first winter at Plymouth.If not for the help of local indigenous peoples to teach them food gathering and other survival skills, all of the colonists might have perished.The following year, those 53 who survived[2] celebrated the colony's first fall harvest along with 90 Wampanoag Native American people,[3] an occasion declared in centuries later the first American Thanksgiving.[4] Before disembarking the Mayflower, the Pilgrims wrote and signed the Mayflower Compact, an agreement that established a rudimentary government, in which each member would contribute to the safety and welfare of the planned settlement.\nQ: who was on the

Washington, long favored the establishment of a university in a central part of the United States.[15] He wrote to the U.S.Congress and others in favor of it, and envisioned it would be in a central part of D.C., stating he hoped the university would educate the most promising students from across the country while reaping the benefits of the nation's capital.[15] Washington included a bequest of his shares in the Potomac Company in his last will and testament, though the shares lost their value and no educational institution ever benefited from them.[16][17] His desire was shared and encouraged after his death by Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, and they expressed the need to carry out Washington's plans.[18] Finally, in 1821 the Baptist missionary and leading minister Luther Rice secured funds from James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, John C.Calhoun and other benefactors for a college to educate citizens from throughout the young nation in Washington, D.C.A large building was constructed on College Hill, which is now known as Meridian Hill, and on February 9, 1821, President Monroe approved the congressional charter creating the non-denominational Columbian College.[19] Washingtonians, Congress and the academic community celebrated this new institution as the fulfillment of Washington's vision.[16] The first commencement in 1824 was considered

since the 20th century.Unlike wind and solar energy, geothermal plants produce power at a constant rate, without regard to weather conditions.Geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs.Most extraction occurs in areas near tectonic plate boundaries..The cost of generating geothermal power decreased by 25% during the 1980s and 1990s.[1] Technological advances continued to reduce costs and thereby expand the amount of viable resources.In 2021, the U.S.Department of Energy estimated that power from a plant \"built today\" costs about $0.05/kWh.[2].In 2019, 13,900 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power was available worldwide.[3] An additional 28 gigawatts provided heat for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes,

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.An RFID system consists of a tiny radio transponder, a radio receiver and transmitter.When triggered by an electromagnetic interrogation pulse from a nearby RFID reader device, the tag transmits digital data, usually an identifying inventory number, back to the reader.This number can be used to track inventory goods.[1].Passive tags are powered by energy from the RFID reader's interrogating radio waves.Active tags are powered by a battery and thus can be read at a greater range from the RFID reader, up to hundreds of meters..Unlike a barcode, the tag does not need to be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object.RFID is one method of automatic identification and data capture (AIDC).[2].RFID tags are used in many industries.For example, an RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line, RFID-tagged pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses, and implanting RFID microchips in livestock and pets enables positive identification of animals.[3][4] Tags can also be used in shops to expedite checkout, and to prevent theft by customers and employees.[5].Since RFID tags can be attached to physical money, clothing, and possessions, or implanted in animals and people, the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised serious privacy concerns.[6] These concerns resulted in standard specifications development addressing privacy and security issues..In 2014, the world RFID market was worth US$8.89 billion, up from US$7.77 billion in 2013 and US$6.96 billion in 2012.\nQ: what is RFID

a period of increasing trouble and decline began under Commodus (180\u2013192).In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a crisis that threatened its existence, as the Gallic and Palmyrene Empires broke away from the Roman state, and a series of short-lived emperors led the Empire.It was reunified under Aurelian (r.\u2009270\u2013275).Diocletian set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West in 286;

the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows (or All Saints) and the day initiating the triduum of Hallowmas .", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Halloween or Hallowe'en (less commonly known as Allhalloween,[9] All Hallows' Eve,[10] or All Saints' Eve)[11] is a celebration observed in many countries  on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day.It is at the beginning of the observance of Allhallowtide,[12] the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed.[5][13][14][15] In popular culture, the day has become a celebration of horror, being associated with the macabre and supernatural.[16].One theory holds that many Halloween traditions were influenced by Celtic harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain, which are believed to have pagan roots.[17][18][19][20] Some go further and suggest that Samhain may have been Christianized as All Hallow's Day, along with its eve, by the early Church.[21] Other academics believe Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, being the vigil of All Hallow's Day.[22][23][24][25] Celebrated in Ireland and Scotland for centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants took many Halloween customs to North America in the 19th century,[26][27] and then through American influence various Halloween customs spread to other countries by the late 20th and early 21st century.[16][28].Popular Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the related guising and souling), attending Halloween costume parties, carving pumpkins or turnips into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, and watching horror or Halloween-themed films.[29] Some people practice the Christian observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead,[30][1][31] although it is a secular celebration for others.[32][2][33] Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows' Eve, a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day, including apples, potato pancakes, and soul cakes.[34][35][36][37].The word Halloween or Hallowe'en (\"Saints' evening\"[38]) is of Christian origin;[39][40] a term equivalent to \"All Hallows Eve\" is attested in Old English.[41] The word hallowe[']en comes from the Scottish form of All Hallows' Eve (the evening before All Hallows' Day):[42] even is the Scots term for \"eve\" or \"evening\",[43] and is contracted to e'en or een;[44] (All) Hallow(s) E(v)en became Hallowe'en..Halloween is thought to have influences from Christian beliefs and practices.[45][46] The English word 'Halloween' comes from \"All Hallows' Eve\", being the evening before the Christian holy days of All Hallows' Day (All Saints' Day) on 1 November and All Souls' Day on 2 November.[47] Since the time of the early Church,[48] major feasts in Christianity (such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost) had vigils that began the night before, as did the feast of All Hallows'.[49][45] These three days are collectively called Allhallowtide and are a time when Western Christians honour all saints and pray for recently departed souls who have yet to reach Heaven.Commemorations of all saints and martyrs were held by several churches on various dates, mostly in springtime.[50] In 4th-century Roman Edessa it was held on 13 May, and on 13 May 609, Pope Boniface IV re-dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to \"St Mary and all martyrs\".[51] This was the date of Lemuria, an ancient Roman festival of the dead.[52].In the 8th century, Pope Gregory III (731\u2013741) founded an oratory in St Peter's for the relics \"of the holy apostles and of all saints, martyrs and confessors\".[45][53] Some sources say it was dedicated on 1 November,[54] while others say it was on Palm Sunday in April 732.[55][56] By 800, there is evidence that churches in Ireland[57] and Northumbria were holding a feast commemorating all saints on 1 November.[58] Alcuin of Northumbria, a member of Charlemagne's court, may then have introduced this 1 November date in the Frankish Empire.[59] In 835, it became the official date in the Frankish Empire.[58] Some suggest this was due to Celtic influence, while others suggest it was a Germanic idea,[58] although it is claimed that both Germanic and Celtic-speaking peoples commemorated the dead at the beginning of winter.[60] They may have seen it as the most fitting time to do so, as it is a time of 'dying' in nature.[58][60] It is also suggested the change was made on the \"practical grounds that Rome in summer could not accommodate the great number of pilgrims who flocked to it\", and perhaps because of public health concerns over Roman Fever, which claimed a number of lives during Rome's sultry summers.[61][45].By the end of the 12th century, the celebration had become known as the holy days of obligation in Western Christianity and involved such traditions as ringing church bells for souls in purgatory.It was also \"customary for criers dressed in black to parade the streets, ringing a bell of mournful sound and calling on all good Christians to remember the poor souls\".[63] The Allhallowtide custom of baking and sharing soul cakes for all christened souls,[64] has been suggested as the origin of trick-or-treating.[65] The custom dates back at least as far as the 15th century[66] and was found in parts of England, Wales, Flanders, Bavaria and Austria.[67] Groups of poor people, often children, would go door-to-door during Allhallowtide, collecting soul cakes, in exchange for praying for the dead, especially the souls of the givers' friends and relatives.This was called \"souling\".[66][68][69] Soul cakes were also offered for the souls themselves to eat,[67] or the 'soulers' would act as their representatives.[70] As with the Lenten tradition of hot cross buns, soul cakes were often marked with a cross, indicating they were baked as alms.[71] Shakespeare mentions souling in his comedy The Two Gentlemen of Verona (1593).[72] While souling, Christians would carry \"lanterns made of hollowed-out turnips\", which could have originally represented souls of the dead;[73][74] jack-o'-lanterns were used to ward off evil spirits.[75][76] On All Saints' and All Souls' Day during the 19th century, candles were lit in homes in Ireland,[77] Flanders, Bavaria, and in Tyrol, where they were called \"soul lights\",[78] that served \"to guide the souls back to visit their earthly homes\".[79] In many of these places, candles were also lit at graves on All Souls' Day.[78] In Brittany, libations of milk were poured on the graves of kinfolk,[67] or food would be left overnight on the dinner table for the returning souls;[78] a custom also found in Tyrol and parts of Italy.[80][78].Christian minister Prince Sorie Conteh linked the wearing of costumes to the belief in vengeful ghosts: \"It was traditionally believed that the souls of the departed wandered the earth until All Saints' Day, and All Hallows' Eve provided one last chance for the dead to gain vengeance on their enemies before moving to the next world.\nQ: What was the original name

age you have to be to have the right to freedom of speech", "document_title": "Freedom of speech", "answer": "Freedom of speech is the political right to communicate one's opinions and ideas using one's body and property to anyone who is willing to receive them.", "label": 0, "input": "Context: Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction.The right to freedom of expression has been recognised as a human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights law by the United Nations.Many countries have constitutional law that protects free speech.Terms like free speech, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression are used interchangeably in political discourse.However, in a legal sense, the freedom of expression includes any activity of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used..Article 19 of the UDHR states that \"everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference\" and \"everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice\".The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries \"special duties and responsibilities\" and may \"therefore be subject to certain restrictions\" when necessary \"[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others\" or \"[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals\".[2].Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, may not be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, hate speech, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, dignity, the right to be forgotten, public security, and perjury.Justifications for such include the harm principle, proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, which suggests that \"the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\".[3].The idea of the \"offense principle\" is also used to justify speech limitations, describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, and ease with which it could be avoided.[3] With the evolution of the digital age, application of freedom of speech becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise, for example, the Golden Shield Project, an initiative by Chinese government's Ministry of Public Security that filters potentially unfavourable data from foreign countries..The Human Rights Measurement Initiative[4] measures the right to opinion and expression for countries around the world, using a survey of in-country human rights experts.[5].Freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern international human rights instruments.[6] It is thought that the ancient Athenian democratic principle of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century BC.[7].\nQ: what is the age

however, many have adopted a policy of decriminalization to make simple possession a non-criminal offense (often similar to a minor traffic violation).Others have much more severe penalties such as some Asian and Middle Eastern countries where possession of even small amounts is punished by imprisonment for several years.[5] Countries that have legalized recreational use of cannabis are Canada, Georgia, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, and Uruguay, plus 24 states, 3 territories, and the District of Columbia in the United States and the Australian Capital Territory in Australia.Commercial sale of recreational cannabis is legalized nationwide in three countries (Canada, Thailand, and Uruguay) and in all subnational U.S.jurisdictions that have legalized possession except Virginia and Washington, D.C.A policy of limited enforcement has also been adopted in many countries, in particular the Netherlands where the sale of cannabis is tolerated at licensed coffeeshops.[6].Countries that have legalized medical use of cannabis include Albania, Argentina, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Rwanda, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.Others have more restrictive laws that allow only the use of certain cannabis-derived pharmaceuticals, such as Sativex, Marinol, or Epidiolex.[7] In the United States, 38 states, 4 territories, and the District of Columbia have legalized the medical use of cannabis, but at the federal level its use remains prohibited.[8].On 21 July 2023 the Albanian Parliament voted 69\u201323 to legalize medical cannabis.[13].Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate.HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload file.\nQ: where is marijuana legal\nReasoning: The legality of cannabis varies from country to country."}, {"question_id": "Q2504", "question": "where is loxahatchee fl at", "document_title": "Loxahatchee, Florida", "answer": "Loxahatchee is a community located in Palm Beach County , Florida , United States .", "label": 1, "input": null}, {"question_id": "Q2505", "question": "what is the format of the canadian citizenship test", "document_title": "Canadian Citizenship Test", "answer": "The Canadian Citizenship Test is a test, administered by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), that is required for all applicants for Canadian citizenship who are aged between 18 and 54 and who meet the basic requirements for citizenship.", "label": 0, "input": null}, {"question_id": "Q2507", "question": "where are the former renaissance ships?", "document_title": "Renaissance Cruises", "answer": "Renaissance Cruises, originally founded in 1989 owned by Fearnley & Eger Rederi in Oslo - Norway, later purchased by Edward Rudner (founder of Alamo Car Rental) as the company faltered during the Gulf War.", "label": 0, "input": null}, {"question_id": "Q2508", "question": "What is the function of an epithelial free surface that is smooth?", "document_title": "Epithelium", "answer": "Epithelium is one of the four basic types of animal tissue , along with connective tissue , muscle tissue and nervous tissue .", "label": 0, "input": null}, {"question_id": "Q2510", "question": "What is up with Kent Hovind", "document_title": "Kent Hovind", "answer": "Kent E.

countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8billion company beverage servings each day.[1] Coca-Cola ranked No.87 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[2] Based on Interbrand's \"best global brand\" study of 2020, Coca-Cola was the world's sixth most valuable brand.[3].Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, Coca-Cola was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia.In 1888, Pemberton sold the ownership rights to Asa Griggs Candler, a businessman, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the global soft-drink market throughout the 20th and 21st century.[4] The name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts (a source of caffeine).[5] The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.The secrecy around the formula has been used by Coca-Cola in its marketing as only a handful of anonymous employees know the formula.[6] The drink has inspired imitators and created a whole classification of soft drink: colas..The Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world.The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners.A typical 12-US-fluid-ounce (350ml) can contains 38 grams (1.3oz) of sugar (usually in the form of high-fructose corn syrup in North America).The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world.The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors..The Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name.\nQ: when was coca cola invented\nReasoning: The Las Vegas Strip World of Coca-Cola museum in 2003"}, {"question_id": "Q2520", "question": "what is four musical bars", "document_title": "Bar

Earth every 75\u201379 years.[1] Halley is the only known short-period comet that is regularly visible to the naked eye from Earth, and thus the only naked-eye comet that can appear twice in a human lifetime.[15] It last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061..Halley's periodic returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers around the world since at least 240 BC.But it was not until 1705 that the English astronomer Edmond Halley understood that these appearances were re-appearances of the same comet.As a result of this discovery, the comet is named after Edmond Halley.[16].During its 1986 visit to the inner Solar System, Halley's Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation.[17][18] These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's \"dirty snowball\" model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices\u2014such as water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and dust.The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy..Comet Halley is commonly pronounced /\u02c8h\u00e6li/, rhyming with valley, or /\u02c8he\u026ali/, rhyming with daily.[19][20] Colin Ronan, one of Edmond Halley's biographers, preferred /\u02c8h\u0254\u02d0li/, rhyming with crawly.[21] Spellings of Halley's name during his lifetime included Hailey, Haley, Hayley, Halley, Hawley, and Hawly, so its contemporary pronunciation is uncertain, but the version rhyming with valley seems to be preferred by current bearers of the surname.[22].Halley was the first comet to be recognized as periodic.Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere.This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon.Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.[23].In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in which he outlined his laws of gravity and motion.\nQ: when is halley's

BC).[1] These independent stories were later used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian.The first surviving version of this combined epic, known as the \"Old Babylonian\" version, dates back to the 18th century BC and is titled after its incipit, Sh\u016btur eli sharr\u012b (\"Surpassing All Other Kings\").Only a few tablets of it have survived.The later Standard Babylonian version compiled by S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba \u012bmuru[note 1] (\"He who Saw the Abyss\", lit.\u2009'\"He who Sees the Unknown\"').Approximately two-thirds of this longer, twelve-tablet version have been recovered.Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal..The first half of the story discusses Gilgamesh (who was king of Uruk) and Enkidu, a wild man created by the gods to stop Gilgamesh from oppressing the people of Uruk.After Enkidu becomes civilized through sexual initiation with Shamhat, he travels to Uruk, where he challenges Gilgamesh to a test of strength.Gilgamesh wins the contest; nonetheless, the two become friends.Together, they make a six-day journey to the legendary Cedar Forest, where they plan to slay the Guardian, Humbaba the Terrible, and cut down the sacred Cedar.[4] The goddess Ishtar sends the Bull of Heaven to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances.Gilgamesh and Enkidu kill the Bull of Heaven after which the gods decide to sentence Enkidu to death and kill him..\nQ: who was more heroic

Catherine of Aragon) annulled.His disagreement with Pope Clement VII about such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation, separating the Church of England from papal authority.He appointed himself Supreme Head of the Church of England and dissolved convents and monasteries, for which he was excommunicated by the pope..Henry is known for his radical changes to the Constitution of England, expanding royal power and ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings in opposition to papal supremacy.He frequently used charges of treason and heresy to quell dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial using bills of attainder.He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour.Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in his administration..Henry was an extravagant spender, using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament.He converted the money that was formerly paid to Rome into royal revenue.Despite the money from these sources, he was often on the verge of financial ruin due to personal extravagance as well as costly and largely unproductive wars, particularly with King Francis I of France, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, King James V of Scotland and the Scottish regency under the Earl of Arran and Mary of Guise.He expanded the Royal Navy, oversaw the annexation of Wales to England with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and was the first

protocols had only just been written[3] and not until the end of 1993 would there be a graphical web browser for Mac or Windows computers.[4] Even after there was some opening up of Internet access, the situation was confused[clarification needed] until 1995.[5].To host a website on the internet, an individual or company would need their own computer or server.[6] As not all companies had the budget or expertise to do this, web hosting services began to offer to host users' websites on their own servers, without the client needing to own the necessary infrastructure required to operate the website.The owners of the websites, also called webmasters, would be able to create a website that would be hosted on the web hosting service's server and published to the web by the web hosting service..As the number of users on the World Wide Web grew, the pressure for companies, both large and small, to have an online presence grew.By 1995, companies such as GeoCities, Angelfire and Tripod

House , the president's official residence and center of the administration", "label": 0, "input": "Context: The president of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States,[1] indirectly elected to a four-year term via the Electoral College.[2] The officeholder leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.[3] Since the office was established in 1789, 45 men have served in 46 presidencies.The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.[4] Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.[5] The incumbent president is Joe Biden.[6].The presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history.[7] Franklin D.Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945.He is the only U.S.president to have served more than two terms.[8] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[9].Four presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G.Harding, and Franklin D.Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A.Garfield, William McKinley, and John F.Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office).[10] John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his presidency.[11].Throughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties.\nQ: who was the 16 president of the united states\nReasoning: The White House , the

the Torah, the Nevi'im, and the Ketuvim.Different branches of Judaism and Samaritanism have maintained different versions of the canon, including the 3rd-century BCE Septuagint text used in Second Temple Judaism, the Syriac Peshitta, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and most recently the 10th-century medieval Masoretic Text compiled by the Masoretes, currently used in Rabbinic Judaism.[2] The terms \"Hebrew Bible\" or \"Hebrew Canon\" are frequently confused with the Masoretic Text; however, this is a medieval version and one of several texts considered authoritative by different types of Judaism throughout history.[2] The current edition of the Masoretic Text is mostly in Biblical Hebrew, with a few passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel and Ezra, and the verse Jeremiah 10:11).[3].The authoritative form of the modern Hebrew Bible used in Rabbinic Judaism is the Masoretic Text (7th to 10th century CE), which consists of 24 books, divided into chapters and pesuqim (verses).The Hebrew Bible developed during the Second Temple Period, as the Jews decided which religious texts were of divine origin; the Masoretic Text, compiled by the Jewish scribes and scholars of the Early Middle Ages, comprises the Hebrew and Aramaic 24 books that they considered authoritative.[2].The Hellenized Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria produced a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible called \"the Septuagint\", that included books later identified as the Apocrypha, while the Samaritans produced their own edition of the Torah, the Samaritan Pentateuch; according to the Dutch\u2013Israeli biblical scholar and linguist Emanuel Tov, professor of Bible Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, both of these ancient editions of the Hebrew Bible differ significantly from the medieval Masoretic Text.[2].In addition to the Masoretic Text, modern biblical scholars seeking to understand the history of the Hebrew Bible use a range of sources.[4] These include the Septuagint, the Syriac language Peshitta translation, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls collection, and quotations from rabbinic manuscripts.These sources may be older than the Masoretic Text in some cases and often differ from it.[5] These differences have given rise to the theory that yet another text, an Urtext of the Hebrew Bible, once existed and is the source of the versions extant today.[6] However, such an Urtext has never been found, and which of the three commonly known versions (Septuagint, Masoretic Text, Samaritan Pentateuch) is closest to the Urtext is debated.[7].There are many similarities between the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament.The Protestant Old Testament has the same books as the Hebrew Bible, but the books are arranged in different orders.The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches include the Deuterocanonical books, which are not included in the Hebrew Bible.[8].Tanakh is an acronym, made from the first Hebrew letter of each of the Masoretic Text's three traditional divisions: Torah (literally 'Instruction' or 'Law'),[9] Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings)\u2014hence TaNaKh..The three-part division reflected in the acronym Tanakh is well attested in the rabbinic literature.[10] During that period, however, Tanakh was not used.\nQ: what is the

1999 by SanDisk, Panasonic (Matsushita) and Toshiba as an improvement on MultiMediaCards (MMCs).[1] SDs have become an industry standard.The three companies formed SD-3C, LLC, a company that licenses and enforces intellectual property (IP) rights associated with SD memory cards and SD host-and-ancillary products.[2].In January 2000, the companies formed the SD Association (SDA), a non-profit organization to create and promote SD Card standards.[3] As of 2023[update], the SDA has approximately 1,000 member companies.It uses several  SD-3C-owned trademarked logos to enforce compliance with its specifications and denote compatibility.[4].In 1999, SanDisk, Panasonic (Matsushita), and Toshiba agreed to develop and market the Secure Digital (SD) memory card.[5] The card was derived from the MultiMediaCard (MMC) and provided digital rights management (DRM) based on the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) standard and a high memory density.[citation needed].SD was designed to compete with the Memory Stick, a DRM product Sony had released the year before.Toshiba hoped its DRM would encourage music suppliers concerned about piracy to use SD cards.[6].The trademarked SD logo was originally developed for the Super Density Disc, which was the unsuccessful Toshiba entry in the DVD format war.For this reason, the letter \"D\" is styled to resemble an optical disc.[7].At the 2000 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the three companies announced the creation of the SD Association (SDA) to promote SD cards.The SD Association, which was headquartered in San Ramon, California, United

recurrence of their properties is evident.The table is divided into four roughly rectangular areas called blocks.Elements in the same group tend to show similar chemical characteristics..Vertical, horizontal and diagonal trends characterize the periodic table.Metallic character increases going down a group and decreases from left to right across a period.Nonmetallic character increases going from the bottom left of the periodic table to the top right..The first periodic table to become generally accepted was that of the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869; he formulated the periodic law as a dependence of chemical properties on atomic mass.As not all elements were then known, there were gaps in his periodic table, and Mendeleev successfully used the periodic law to predict some properties of some of the missing elements.The periodic law was recognized as a fundamental discovery in the late 19th century.It was explained early in the 20th century, with the discovery of atomic

the Executive Director of the Shafer Commission, Michael Sonnenreich; and the Director of the BNDD, John Ingersoll creating and writing the legislation, Mitchell was able to present Nixon with the bill.[10].The CSA not only combined existing federal drug laws and expanded their scope, but it also changed the nature of federal drug law policies and expanded federal law enforcement pertaining to controlled substances..\nQ: what is tylenol 3 on schedule of drugs\nReasoning: The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was enacted into law by the Congress of the United States as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 ."}, {"question_id": "Q2901", "question": "what is the address of mother's park & ride in wayne nj", "document_title": "Wayne Route 23 Transit Center", "answer": "The Wayne Route 23 Transit Center is a New Jersey Transit park-and-ride station in Wayne , New Jersey along the Montclair-Boonton Line that provides bus service to New York City and various other points in the area as well as Montclair-Boonton Line train service to New York, Hoboken, and intermediate points along the line between Hackettstown and Montclair State University .", "label": 0, "input": null}, {"question_id": "Q2904", "question": "what is the @ sign called?", "document_title": "At sign", "answer": "The at sign @ is also commonly called the at symbol, ampersat, apetail or commercial at in English\u2014and less commonly a wide range of other terms.", "label": 1, "input": null}, {"question_id": "Q2905", "question": "who is the book the catcher in the rye by?", "document_title": "The Catcher in the Rye", "answer": "The Catcher in the Rye is a 1951 novel by J.

Motown\" and \"Prince of Soul\"..Gaye's Motown songs include \"Ain't That Peculiar\", \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\", and \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\".Gaye also recorded duets with Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Tammi Terrell, and Diana Ross.During the 1970s, Gaye recorded the albums What's Going On (1971) and Let's Get It On (1973) and became one of the first artists in Motown to break away from the reins of a production company..His later recordings influenced several contemporary R&B subgenres, such as quiet storm and neo soul.[3] \"Sexual Healing\", released in 1982 on the album Midnight Love, won him his first two Grammy Awards.[4] Gaye's last televised appearances were at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, where he sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"; and on Motown 25:

nuclear power plant", "label": 0, "input": "Context: The Chernobyl disaster[a] began on 26 April 1986 with the explosion of the No.4 reactor of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR, close to the border with the Byelorussian SSR, in the Soviet Union.[1] It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven\u2014the maximum severity\u2014on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.The initial emergency response and subsequent mitigation efforts involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18billion roubles\u2014roughly US$68billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation.[2] It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history.[3][4][5].The accident occurred during a test of the steam turbine's ability to power the emergency feedwater pumps in the event of a simultaneous loss of external power and coolant pipe rupture.Following an accidental drop in reactor power to near-zero, the operators restarted the reactor in preparation for the turbine test with a prohibited control rod configuration.Upon successful completion of the test, the reactor was then shut down for maintenance.Due to a variety of factors, this action resulted in a power surge at the base of the reactor which brought about the rupture of reactor components and the loss of coolant.This process led to steam explosions and a meltdown, which destroyed the containment building.This was followed by a reactor core fire which lasted until 4 May 1986, during which airborne radioactive contaminants were spread throughout the USSR and Europe.[6][7] In response to the initial accident, a 10-kilometre (6.2mi) radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident, from which approximately 49,000 people were evacuated, primarily from Pripyat.The exclusion zone was later increased to a radius of 30 kilometres (19mi), from which an additional ~68,000 people were evacuated.[8].Following the reactor explosion, which killed two engineers and severely burned two more, an emergency operation to put out the fires and stabilize the surviving reactor began, during which 237 workers were hospitalized, of which 134 exhibited symptoms of acute radiation syndrome (ARS).Among those hospitalized, 28 died within the following three months.In the following 10 years, 14 more workers (9 of whom had been hospitalized with ARS) died of various causes mostly unrelated to radiation exposure.[9] 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were attributed to the disaster as of 2011[update].[10][11] A United Nations committee found that to date fewer than 100 deaths have resulted from the fallout.[12] Model predictions of the eventual total death toll in the coming decades vary.\nQ: what was the distance of evacuation from the russian nuclear meltdown\nReasoning: Location of Chernobyl nuclear power plant"}, {"question_id": "Q2946", "question": "what is santa's wife's

"label": 0, "input": "Context: Task Manager, previously known as Windows Task Manager, is a task manager, system monitor, and startup manager included with Microsoft Windows systems.It provides information about computer performance and running software, including name of running processes, CPU and GPU load, commit charge, I/O details, logged-in users, and Windows services.Task Manager can also be used to set process priorities, processor affinity, start and stop services, and forcibly terminate processes..The program can be started in recent versions of Windows by pressing \u229e Win+R and then typing in taskmgr.exe,or by typing launchtm.exe, or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete and clicking Task Manager, by pressing Ctrl+\u21e7 Shift+Esc, by using Windows Search in the Start Menu and typing taskmgr, by right-clicking on the Windows taskbar and selecting \"Task Manager\", by typing taskmgr in the File Explorer address bar, or by typing taskmgr in Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell..Task Manager was introduced in its current form with Windows NT 4.0.Prior versions of Windows NT, as well as Windows 3.x, include the Task List application, are capable of listing currently running processes and killing them, or creating new processes.Windows 9x has a program known as Close Program which lists the programs currently running and offers options to close programs as well shut down the computer.[2].Since Windows 8, Task Manager has two views.The first time Task Manager is invoked by a user, it shows in a simplified summary mode (described in the user experience as Fewer Details).It can be switched to a more detailed mode by clicking More Details.This setting is remembered for that user on that machine.[3].Since at least Windows 2000, the CPU usage can be displayed as a tray icon in the task bar for quick glance.[4][5].\nQ: where is the processes tab located on windows xp\nReasoning: Windows Task Manager is a task manager or System monitor application
