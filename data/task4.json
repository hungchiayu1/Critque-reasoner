[{"input": "Context: A glacier cave is a cave formed within the ice of a glacier.Glacier caves are often called ice caves, but the latter term is properly used to describe bedrock caves that contain year-round ice.[1].Most glacier caves are started by water running through or under the glacier.This water often originates on the glacier's surface through melting, entering the ice at a moulin and exiting at the glacier's snout at base level.Heat transfer from the water can cause sufficient melting to create an air-filled cavity, sometimes aided by solifluction.Air movement can then assist enlargement through melting in summer and sublimation in winter..Some glacier caves are formed by geothermal heat from volcanic vents or hotsprings beneath the ice.An extreme example is the Kverkfj\u00f6ll glacier cave in the Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland, measured in the 1980s at 2.8 kilometres (1.7mi) long with a vertical range of 525 metres (1,722ft)..Some glacier caves are relatively unstable due to melting and glacial motion, and are subject to localized or complete collapse, as well as elimination by glacial retreat.An example of the dynamic nature of glacier caves is the former Paradise Ice Caves, located on Mount Rainier in the United States.Known since the early 1900s, the caves were thought to have disappeared altogether in the mid-1940s, yet in 1978 cavers measured 13.25 kilometres (8.23mi) of passageways in glacier caves there, and it was then considered the longest glacier cave system in the world.The Paradise Ice Caves collapsed and vanished in the 1990s, and the lower lobe of the glacier which once contained the caves has also vanished entirely between 2004 and 2006..\nQ: how are glacier caves formed?", "output": "Reasoning: A glacier cave is a

Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J.K.Rowling.The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people)..The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States.A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[1] Major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, madness, and death.[2][3].Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide.They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are widely considered cornerstones of modern literature.[4][5] As of February2023[update], the books have sold more

to supply the necessary energy, but non-combusting forms such as cold gas thrusters and nuclear thermal rockets also exist.Vehicles propelled by rocket engines are commonly called rockets.Rocket vehicles carry their own oxidiser, unlike most combustion engines, so rocket engines can be used in a vacuum to propel spacecraft and ballistic missiles..Compared to other types of jet engine, rocket engines are the lightest and have the highest thrust, but are the least propellant-efficient (they have the lowest specific impulse).The ideal exhaust is hydrogen, the lightest of all elements, but chemical rockets produce a mix of heavier species, reducing the exhaust velocity..Rocket engines become more efficient at high speeds, due to the Oberth effect.[1].Here, \"rocket\" is used as an abbreviation for \"rocket engine\"..Thermal rockets use an inert propellant, heated by electricity (electrothermal propulsion) or a nuclear reactor (nuclear thermal rocket)..Chemical rockets are

none, to mild, to severe.[3] The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea lasting a few days.[2] Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur.[3] Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.[2] This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet.[5] Dehydration can cause the skin to turn bluish.[8] Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.[3].Cholera is caused by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, with some types producing more severe disease than others.[2] It is spread mostly by unsafe water and unsafe food that has been contaminated with human feces containing the bacteria.[2] Undercooked shellfish is a common source.[9] Humans are the only known host for the bacteria.[2] Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, insufficient clean drinking water, and poverty.[2] Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test,[2] or a rapid dipstick test, although the dipstick test is less accurate.[10].Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water.[5] Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months, and confer the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by E.coli.[2] In 2017 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a single-dose, live, oral cholera vaccine called Vaxchora for adults aged 18\u201364 who are travelling to an area of active cholera transmission.[11] It offers limited protection to young children.People who survive an episode of cholera have long-lasting immunity for at least 3 years (the period tested.)[12].The primary treatment for affected individuals is oral rehydration salts (ORS), the replacement of fluids and electrolytes by using slightly sweet and salty solutions.[2] Rice-based solutions are preferred.[2] In children, Zinc supplementation has also been found to improve outcomes.[6] In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as Ringer's lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial.[2] The choice of antibiotic is aided by antibiotic sensitivity testing.[3].Cholera continues to affect an estimated 3\u20135million people worldwide and causes 28,800\u2013130,000deaths a year.[2][7] To date, seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the developing world, with the most recent beginning in 1961, and continuing today.[13] The illness is rare in high-income countries, and affects children most severely.[2][14] Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas.[2] Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and Southeast Asia.[2] The risk of death among those affected is usually less than 5%, given improved treatment, but may be as high as 50% without such access to treatment.[2] Descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC in Sanskrit.[5] In Europe, cholera was a term initially used to describe any kind of gastroenteritis, and was not used for this disease until the early 19th century.[15] The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology because of his insights about transmission via contaminated water, and a map of the same was the first recorded incidence of epidemiological tracking.[5][16].The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid.[17] These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria.[18] The diarrhea is frequently described as \"rice water\" in nature and may have a fishy odor.[17] An untreated person with cholera may produce 10 to 20 litres (3 to 5USgal) of diarrhea a day.[17] Severe cholera, without treatment, kills about half of affected individuals.[17] If the severe diarrhea is not treated, it can result in life-threatening dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.[17] Estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100.[19] Cholera has been nicknamed the \"blue death\"[20] because a person's skin may turn bluish-gray from extreme loss of fluids.[21].Fever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection.Patients can be lethargic and might have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, or wrinkled hands and feet.Kussmaul breathing, a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of acidosis from stool bicarbonate losses and lactic acidosis associated with poor perfusion.Blood pressure drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time.Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, seizures, or even coma due to electrolyte imbalances are common, especially in children.[17].\nQ: how are cholera and typhus transmitted and prevented", "output": "Reasoning: Transmission occurs primarily by drinking water or

electrons follow around an atom's nucleus.The closest shell to the nucleus is called the \"1 shell\" (also called the \"K shell\"), followed by the \"2 shell\" (or \"L shell\"), then the \"3 shell\" (or \"M shell\"), and so on farther and farther from the nucleus.The shells correspond to the principal quantum numbers (n = 1, 2, 3, 4...) or are labeled alphabetically with the letters used in X-ray notation (K, L, M,...).A useful guide when understanding electron shells in atoms is to note that each row on the conventional periodic table of elements represents an electron shell..Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: the first shell can hold up to two electrons, the second shell can hold up to eight (2 + 6) electrons, the third shell can hold up to 18 (2 + 6 + 10) and so on.The general formula is that the nth shell can in principle hold up to 2(n2) electrons.[1] For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells, see electron configuration.[2].Each shell consists of one or more subshells, and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals..In 1913, Bohr proposed a model of the atom, giving the arrangement of electrons in their sequential orbits.At that time, Bohr allowed the capacity of the inner orbit of the atom to increase to eight electrons as the atoms got larger, and \"in the scheme given below the number of electrons in this [outer] ring is arbitrary put equal to the normal valency of the corresponding element\".Using these and other constraints, he proposed configurations that are in accord with those now known only for the first six elements.\"From the above we are led to the following possible scheme for the arrangement of the electrons in light atoms:\"[3][4].The shell terminology comes from Arnold Sommerfeld's modification of the 1913 Bohr model.\nQ: how are the # of electrons in each shell determined", "output": "Reasoning: Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: The 1st shell can hold up

won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.[4] Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.[5] The incumbent president is Joe Biden.[6].The presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history.[7] Franklin D.Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945.He is the only U.S.president to have served more than two terms.[8] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[9].Four presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry

birds they were, how many there were, or how they fed.This practice was known as \"taking the auspices\".As circumstance did not always favour the convenient appearance of wild birds or weather phenomena, domesticated chickens kept for the purpose were sometimes released into the templum, where their behaviour, particularly how they fed, could be studied by the augur.[1].The augural ceremony and function of the augur was central to any major undertaking in Roman society \u2013 public or private \u2013 including matters of war, commerce, and religion.Augurs sought the divine will regarding any proposed course of action which might affect Rome's pax, fortuna, and salus (peace, good fortune, and well-being).[2].Although ancient authors believed that the term \"augur\" contained the words avis and ger\u014d \u2013 Latin for \"directing the birds\", historical-linguistic evidence points instead to the root auge\u014d: \"to increase, to prosper\".[citation needed].Political, military and civil actions were sanctioned by augury and by haruspices..Historically, augury was performed by priests of the college of augurs on behalf of senior magistrates.The practice itself likely comes from the neighboring region of Etruria, where augurs were highly respected as officials.\nQ: What did the augurs use to interpret the will of the gods?", "output": "Reasoning: His main role was to

is a tradition observed in the United States and Canada on February 2 of every year starting in the 16th century.[citation needed] It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and sees its shadow, it will retreat to its den and winter will go on for six more weeks; if it does not see its shadow, spring will arrive early..While the tradition remains popular in the 21st century, studies have found no consistent association between a groundhog seeing its shadow and the subsequent arrival time of spring-like weather.[2].The weather lore was brought from German-speaking areas where the badger (German: Dachs) is the forecasting animal.It is related to the lore that clear weather on the Christian festival of Candlemas forebodes a prolonged winter..The Groundhog Day ceremony held at Punxsutawney in western Pennsylvania, centering on a semi-mythical groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil, has become the most frequently attended ceremony.Grundsow Lodges in Pennsylvania Dutch Country in the southeastern part of the state observe the occasion as well.Other cities in the United States and Canada also have adopted the event..The Pennsylvania Dutch were immigrants from German-speaking areas of Europe.The Germans had a tradition of marking Candlemas (February 2) as \"Badger Day\" (Dachstag), on which if a badger emerging from its den encountered a sunny day, thereby casting a shadow, it presaged four more weeks of winter..Candlemas is a primarily Catholic festival but also known in the German Protestant (Lutheran) churches.In folk religion, various traditions and superstitions continue to be linked with the holiday, although this was discouraged by the Protestant Reformers in the 16th century.[3] Notably, several traditions that are part of weather lore use the weather at Candlemas to predict the start of spring..The weather-predicting animal on Candlemas was usually the badger, although regionally, the animal was the bear or the fox.[4] The original weather-predicting animal in Germany had been the bear, another hibernating mammal, but when they grew scarce, the lore became altered.[5].\nQ: what does a groundhog look for on groundhog day", "output": "Reasoning: According to folklore, if it is cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day, then spring will come early; if it is sunny, the groundhog will supposedly see its shadow and retreat back into its burrow, and the winter weather will continue for six more weeks."}, {"input": "Context: \nQ: What

bottom) alternate with rows of five stars.The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 U.S.states, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from Great Britain, which they obtained in their victory in the American Revolutionary War.[1].During the Revolutionary War era, the \"Rebellious Stripes\" were considered as the most important element of United States flag designs, and were always mentioned before the stars.The \"Stripes and Stars\" was a popular phrase into the 19th century.Credit for the term \"Stars and Stripes\" has been given to the Marquis de Lafayette, a French soldier who volunteered his aid to the Continental Army, led by George Washington, in the Revolutionary War against Britain.[2].Nicknames for the flag include the Stars

well-being\".In the 17th century, the definition of \"commonwealth\" expanded from its original sense of \"public welfare\" or \"commonweal\" to mean \"a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or democratic state\".[3][4].The term evolved to become a title to a number of political entities.Three countries \u2013 Australia, the Bahamas, and Dominica \u2013 have the official title \"Commonwealth\", as do four U.S.states and two U.S.territories.Since the early 20th century, the term has been used to name some fraternal associations of states, most notably the Commonwealth of Nations, an organisation primarily of former territories of the British Empire.The organisation is not to be confused with the realms of the Commonwealth..Translations of Ancient Roman

impeached and removed from office.[3] When a vacancy occurs, the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoints a new justice.Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases

Fame \u2013 the latter were held separately from 2005 to 2010 but returned to the general ceremony in 2011.For 2010, ARIA introduced public voted awards for the first time..Winning, or even being nominated for, an ARIA award results in a lot of media attention and publicity on an artist, and usually increases recording sales several-fold, as well as chart significance \u2013 in 2005, for example, after Ben Lee won three awards, his album Awake Is the New Sleep jumped from No.31 to No.5 in the ARIA Charts, its highest position.In October 1995 singer-songwriter Tina Arena became the first woman to win Album of the Year for Don't Ask (1994) and Song of the Year for \"Chains\".Before the ceremony the album had achieved 3\u00d7 platinum (for shipment of 210,000 copies) and by year's end it was 8\u00d7 platinum (560,000 copies) and had topped the end of year albums chart.[2][third-party source needed].In 1983, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) was established by the six major record companies then operating in Australia, EMI, Festival Records, CBS (now known as Sony Music), RCA (now known as BMG), WEA (now known as Warner Music) and PolyGram (now known as Universal) replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956.[3] It later included smaller record companies representing independent acts/labels and has over 100 members.[3].Australian TV pop music show Countdown presented its own annual awards ceremony, Countdown Music and Video Awards, which were co-produced by Carolyn James (also known as Carolyn Bailey) from 1981 to 1984 and, in the latter two years, in collaboration with ARIA.[4][5][6] ARIA provided peer voting for some awards, while Countdown provided coupons in the related Countdown Magazine for viewers to vote for populist awards.[7] At the 1985 Countdown awards ceremony, held on 14 April 1986, fans of INXS and Uncanny X-Men scuffled during the broadcast and as a result ARIA decided to hold their own awards.[6] Australian music journalist, Anthony O'Grady, described the fans of Uncanny X-Men, \"screeching dismay and derision every time their heroes were denied a prize.Finally, when INXS were announced Best Group and Michael Hutchence walked towards the stage, X-Men fans unfurled a 2-metre banner reading: '@*l! OFF POCK FACE'.\"[8].After that ceremony ARIA withdrew their support for the Countdown awards.Meanwhile, four music industry representatives had met in Sydney: a talent manager Peter Rix and three record company executives Brian Harris, Peter Ikin and Gil Robert.Rix summarised the outcome, \"the industry deserved a peer-voting Awards night and it needed to be sanctioned by\" ARIA.[8] Its \"primary purpose was to strive for some sort of objective overview of excellence in recording.\"[8] Rather than the ARIA board pay the entire cost of the event, \"we cooked up a scheme whereby the ARIA Awards would be funded by individual record companies buying tickets for a dinner.\"[8] Rix and his group approached ARIA board members, Paul Turner (also managing director of WEA) and Brian Smith (BMG's managing director) then-chairperson of ARIA.\nQ: What group took home the award for best rock album at the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards?", "output":

specialist floating plant, known as a dredger..Usually the main objectives of dredging is to recover material of value or use, or to create a greater depth of water.[1] Dredging systems can either be shore-based, brought to a location based on barges, or built into purpose built vessels..Dredging has significant environmental impacts: it can disturb marine sediments, leading to both short- and long-term water pollution, destroy important seabed ecosystems, and can release legacy human-sourced toxins captured in the sediment.These environmental impacts can significantly hurt marine wildlife

Revolutionary War.He fought with distinction for the American Continental Army and rose to the rank of major general before defecting to the British in 1780.General George Washington had given him his fullest trust and had placed him in command of West Point in New York.Arnold was planning to surrender the fort to British forces, but the plot was discovered in September 1780, whereupon he fled to the British lines.In the later part of the war, Arnold was commissioned as a brigadier general in the British Army and placed in command of the American Legion.He led the British army in battle

port or port number is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service.At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service.A port at the software level is identified for each transport protocol and address combination by the port number assigned to it.The most common transport protocols that use port numbers are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP); those port numbers are 16-bit unsigned numbers..A port number is always associated with a network address of a host, such as an IP address, and the type of transport protocol used for communication.It completes the destination or origination address of a message.Specific port numbers are reserved to identify specific services so that an arriving packet can be easily forwarded to a running application.For this purpose, port numbers lower than 1024 identify the historically most commonly used services and are called the well-known port numbers.Higher-numbered ports are available for general use by applications and are known as ephemeral ports..Ports provide a multiplexing service for multiple services or multiple communication sessions at one network address.In the client\u2013server model of application architecture, multiple simultaneous communication sessions may be initiated for the same service..For TCP and UDP, a port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535.\nQ: how many ports are there in

criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant, to inform them of the charges against them.In response to arraignment, in some jurisdictions, the accused is expected to enter a plea; in other jurisdictions, no plea is required.Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions, but they generally include guilty, not guilty, and the peremptory pleas, or pleas in bar, setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed.Pleas of nolo contendere ('no contest') and the Alford plea are allowed in some circumstances..In Australia, arraignment is the first of 11 stages in a criminal trial, and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment.The judge will testify during the indictment process.[citation needed].In British Columbia, arraignment takes place in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer.The defendant is asked whether they plead guilty or not guilty to each charge.[1].In France, the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than 24 hours from the time of the arrest.[2] However, police custody can last another 24 hours in specific circumstances, especially if the offence is punishable by at least one year's imprisonment, or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time, and can last up to 96 hours in certain cases involving terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime.[2] The police need to have the consent of the prosecutor, the procureur.In the vast majority of cases, the prosecutor will consent.[2].In Germany, if one has been arrested and taken into custody by the police, one must be brought before a judge as soon as possible and at the latest on the day after the arrest.[3].In New Zealand law, at the first appearance of the accused, they are read the charges and asked for

the day are divided into two periods: a.m.(from Latin ante meridiem, translating to \"before midday\") and p.m.(from Latin post meridiem, translating to \"after midday\").[1][2] Each period consists of 12 hours numbered: 12 (acting as 0),[3] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.The 12-hour clock was developed from the second millennium BC and reached its modern form in the 16th century..The 12-hour time convention is common in several English-speaking nations and former British colonies, as well as a few other countries.There is no widely accepted convention for how midday and midnight should be represented: in English-speaking countries, \"12p.m.\" indicates 12 o'clock noon, while \"12a.m.\" means 12 o'clock midnight.[4][5][6].The natural day-and-night division of a calendar day forms the fundamental basis as to why each day is split into two cycles.Originally there were two cycles: one cycle which could be tracked by the position of the Sun (day), followed by one cycle which could be tracked by the Moon and stars (night).This eventually evolved into the two 12-hour periods which are used today, one called \"a.m.\" starting at midnight and another called \"p.m.\" starting at noon.Noon itself is rarely abbreviated today; but if it is, it is denoted \"m.\"[1].The 12-hour clock can be traced back as far as Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt.[7] Both an Egyptian sundial for daytime use[8] and an Egyptian water clock for night-time use were found in the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep I.[9] Dating to c.\u20091500 BC, these clocks divided their respective times of use into 12 hours each..The Romans also used a 12-hour clock: daylight was divided into 12 equal hours (thus hours having varying length throughout the year) and the night was divided into four watches.[citation

government, public health and public policy analysts.[3][4][5][6][7] The two countries had similar healthcare systems before Canada changed its system in the 1960s and 1970s.The United States spends much more money on healthcare than Canada, on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP.[8] In 2006, per-capita spending for health care in Canada was US$3,678; in the U.S., US$6,714.The U.S.spent 15.3% of GDP on healthcare in that year; Canada spent 10.0%.[8] In 2006, 70% of healthcare spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46% in the United States.Total government spending per capita in the U.S.on healthcare was 23% higher than Canadian government spending.U.S.government expenditure on healthcare was just under 83% of total Canadian spending (public and private).[9].Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending.A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that \"health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent.\"[10] Some of the noted differences were a higher life expectancy in Canada, as well as a lower infant mortality rate than the United States..One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health Organization's ratings of

tropical plant with an edible fruit; it is the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.[4].The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries.The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury.Since the 1820s, pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations..Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a multiple fruit.The plant normally propagates from the offset produced at the top of the fruit[2][5] or from a side shoot, and typically matures within a year.[5][6].The pineapple is a herbaceous perennial, which grows to 1.0 to 1.5m (3ft 3in to 4ft 11in) tall on average, although sometimes it can be taller.The plant has a short, stocky stem with tough, waxy leaves.When creating its fruit, it usually produces up to 200 flowers, although some large-fruited cultivars can exceed this.Once it flowers, the individual fruits of the flowers join together to create a multiple fruit.After the first fruit is produced, side shoots (called 'suckers' by commercial growers) are produced in the leaf axils of the main stem.These suckers may be removed for propagation, or left to produce additional fruits on the original plant.[5] Commercially, suckers that appear around the base are cultivated.\nQ: how do pineapples grow", "output": "Reasoning: Pineapples may be cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit, possibly flowering in 20\u201324 months and fruiting in the following six

from c.\u20094000 BC.[12].The earliest evidence of a grape and rice mixed based fermented drink sometimes compared to wine was found in ancient China (c.\u20097000 BC).[13][14][15][16][17].The altered consciousness produced by wine has been considered religious since its origin.The ancient Greeks worshiped Dionysus or Bacchus and the Ancient Romans carried on his cult.[18][19] Consumption of ritual wine, probably a certain type of sweet wine originally, was part of Jewish practice since Biblical times and, as part of the eucharist commemorating Jesus's Last Supper, became even more essential to the Christian Church.[20] Although Islam nominally forbade the production or consumption of wine, during its Golden Age, alchemists such as Geber pioneered wine's distillation for medicinal and industrial purposes such as the production of perfume.[21].Wine production and consumption increased, burgeoning from the 15th century onwards as part of European expansion.Despite the devastating 1887 phylloxera louse infestation, modern science and technology adapted and industrial wine production and wine consumption now occur throughout the world..The origins of wine predate written records, and modern archaeology is still uncertain about the details of the first cultivation of wild grapevines.It has been hypothesized that early humans climbed trees to pick berries, liked their sugary flavor, and then began collecting them.After a few days with fermentation setting in, juice at the bottom of any container would begin producing low-alcohol wine.According to this theory, things changed around 10,000\u20138000 BC with the transition from a nomadic to a sedentary style of living, which led to agriculture and wine domestication.[22].Wild grapes grow in the Caucasus

in the presence of an inorganic electron acceptor, such as oxygen, to drive the bulk production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which contains energy.Cellular respiration may be described as a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from nutrients into ATP, and then release waste products.[1].Cellular respiration is a vital process that happens in the cells of living organisms, including humans, plants, and animals.It's how cells produce energy to power all the activities necessary for life..The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, producing large amounts of energy (ATP).Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity.The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions.Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it is an unusual one because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions..Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent is molecular oxygen (O2).The chemical energy stored in ATP (the bond of its third phosphate group to the rest of the molecule can be broken allowing more stable products to form, thereby releasing energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes..Aerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP.Although carbohydrates, fats and proteins  are consumed as reactants, aerobic respiration is the preferred method of

an English polymath active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher.[7] He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed.His pioneering book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, consolidated many previous results and established classical mechanics.[8][9] Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus, though notably he developed calculus well before Leibniz.[10][11] He is considered one of the greatest and most influential scientists in history.[12][13][14][15][7].In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity.Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity.[16] He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles.Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems..Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum.His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704.He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid.In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves..Newton was a

"Context: Newton's law of universal gravitation is usually stated as that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.[note 1] The publication of the law has become known as the \"first great unification\", as it marked the unification of the previously described phenomena of gravity on Earth with known astronomical behaviors.[1][2][3].This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called inductive reasoning.[4] It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton's work Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (\"the Principia\"), first published on 5 July 1687.When Newton presented Book 1 of the unpublished text in April 1686 to the Royal Society, Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him..The equation for universal gravitation thus takes the form:.where F is the gravitational force acting between two objects, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, r is the distance between the centers of their masses, and G is the gravitational constant..The first test of Newton's law of gravitation between masses in the laboratory was the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798.[5] It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton's Principia and approximately 71 years after his death..Newton's law of gravitation resembles Coulomb's law of electrical forces, which is used to calculate the magnitude of the electrical force arising between two charged bodies.Both are inverse-square laws, where force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies.Coulomb's law has charge in place of mass and a different constant..Newton's law has later been superseded by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, but the universality of the gravitational constant is intact and the law still continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity in most applications.Relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme accuracy, or when dealing with very strong gravitational fields, such as those found near extremely massive and dense objects, or at small distances (such as Mercury's orbit around the Sun)..Around 1600, the scientific method began to take root.\nQ: what does the universal law of gravitation state", "output": "Reasoning: Newton's law of universal gravitation states

interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926..At its inception, the NHL had four teams, all in Canada, thus the adjective \"National\" in the league's name.The league expanded to the United States in 1924, when the Boston Bruins joined, and has since consisted of both American and Canadian teams.From 1942 to 1967, the league had only six teams, collectively (if not contemporaneously) nicknamed the \"Original Six\".The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the 1967 NHL

has the opposite meaning in the United States from that of the rest of the world:.Motions which use the word \"table\" have specific meanings and functions, depending on the parliamentary authority used.The meaning of \"table\" also depends on the context in which it is used..Both the American and the British dialects have the expression \"to table a topic\" as a short way of saying \"to lay a topic on the table\" and \"to make a topic lie on the table\", but these have opposite meanings in the different varieties of the languages.The British meaning is based on the idea of parliamentarians gathering around a table with the bill laid upon so that all may point to sections for discussion.The American sense draws on the image of taking a paper that one has been examining and laying it aside, ending any discussion about it.The phrase \"put on the table\" can have the same meaning of \"making the issue available for debate\" in both dialects.[1][2][3] According to the American Heritage Dictionary, on the table in American English always has the two opposite meanings up for discussion and put aside for consideration at a later date depending on the context.[4].The British meaning of to \"table\" is to begin consideration of a proposal.[1] This comes from the use of the term to describe physically laying legislation on the table in the British Parliament; once an item on the order paper has been laid on the table, it becomes the current subject for debate.[5].The American meaning of \"to table\" is to postpone or suspend consideration of a motion.[1] In American usage, to allow consideration of the topic again, it would have to be \"taken from the table\".The use of expressions such as \"tabling a motion\" for setting aside or killing a main motion can cause confusion due to the usage of such expressions in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, where they have the opposite meaning\u2014that is, to propose a motion for consideration.[6][7] To make the intent clear internationally, the Congressional Quarterly and its associated CQ publications usually follow the word \"table\" (as used in Congress) with the word \"kill\" in parentheses in reporting congressional votes.[8][9].Under Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, the subsidiary motion to lay on the table is properly used only when it is necessary to suspend consideration of a main motion in order to deal with another matter that has come up unexpectedly and which must be dealt with before the pending motion can be properly addressed.[10] It has, however, become common to misuse this motion to end consideration of the pending main motion without debate, or to mistakenly assume that its adoption prevents further consideration of the main motion at all, or until a specified time.[11][12] Using \"table\" as a verb usually indicates misuse of this motion.[13] The book states, \"It is preferable to avoid moving 'to table' a motion, or 'that the motion be tabled.'\"[13].A main motion that has been laid on the table may be taken up again by adoption of a motion to take from the table.[14] A motion can be taken from the table at the same session (or meeting) or at the next session (or meeting) if that session occurs within a quarterly time interval.[15] Otherwise, the motion dies.[15].\nQ: what does a vote to table a motion mean?", "output":

is the actual amount of positive (nuclear) charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom.The term \"effective\" is used because the shielding effect of negatively charged electrons prevent higher energy electrons from experiencing the full nuclear charge of the nucleus due to the repelling effect of inner layer.The effective nuclear charge experienced by an electron is also called the core charge.It is possible to determine the strength of the nuclear charge by the oxidation number of the atom.Most of the physical and chemical properties of the elements can be explained on the basis of electronic configuration.Consider the behavior of ionization energies in the periodic table.It is known that the magnitude of ionization potential depends upon the following factors:.In the periodic table, effective nuclear charge decreases down a group and increases left to right across a period..The effective atomic number Zeff, (sometimes referred to as the effective nuclear charge) of an atom is the number of protons that an electron in the element effectively 'sees' due to screening by inner-shell electrons.It is a measure of the electrostatic interaction

five years.[5] The second season of Heroes attracted an average of 13.1 million viewers in the U.S.[6] and marked NBC's sole series among the top 20 ranked programs in total viewership for the 2007\u20132008 season.[7] Heroes earned a number of awards and nominations, including Primetime Emmy Awards, Golden Globes, People's Choice Awards, and British Academy Television Awards.[2].An online extension of the series, Heroes 360 Experience (later rebranded as Heroes Evolutions), was created to explore the Heroes universe and provides insight into the show's mythology.[8] Other official Heroes media include magazines, action figures, tie-in and interactive websites, a mobile game, a novel, clothing and other merchandise.In the fall of 2008, NBC Digital Entertainment released a series of online content for the summer, including more original web content, wireless iTV interactivity, graphic novels available for mobile viewing and webisodes.[9].A 13-episode follow-up miniseries, Heroes Reborn, premiered on NBC on September 24, 2015.[10][11].Originally, Kring designed the series to have an ever-shifting cast.However, his motivation changed when he realized how popular the original cast was with audiences; therefore, he brought back most of the first-season cast for the second season, with a few additions who received star billing.[12] In its first season, the show features an ensemble cast of twelve main characters making it the third largest cast in American primetime television behind Desperate Housewives and Lost.Although NBC's first-season cast page listed only ten characters,[13] Leonard Roberts, who first appeared in the series' fifth episode as D L Hawkins, was an additional member of the original full-time cast.In the first-season episode

students, and are often preferred to handbags for carrying heavy loads or carrying any sort of equipment, because of the limited capacity to carry heavy weights for long periods of time in the hands..Large backpacks, used to carry loads over 10 kilograms (22lb), as well as smaller sports backpacks (e.g.running, cycling, hiking, and hydration), usually offload the largest part (up to about 90%) of their weight onto padded hip belts, leaving the shoulder straps mainly for stabilising the load.This improves the potential to carry heavy loads, as the hips are stronger than the shoulders, and also increases agility and balance, since the load rides nearer the wearer's own center of mass..The word backpack was coined in the United States in the 1910s.Moneybag and packsack were used

31 states and Mexico City, its capital..Human presence in Pre-Columbian Mexico goes back to 8,000 BCE.It became one of the world's six cradles of civilization.The Mesoamerican region was home to many intertwined civilizations, including the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, and Purepecha.The Aztecs dominated the region in the century before European contact.In 1521, the Spanish Empire and its indigenous allies conquered the Aztec Empire from its capital Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), establishing the colony of New Spain.[14] Over the next three centuries, Spain and the Catholic Church expanded the territory, enforced Christianity and spread the Spanish language.[15] With the discovery of rich deposits of silver in Zacatecas and Guanajuato, New Spain became one of the most important

doubles and home runs, relative to singles.Plate appearances resulting in walks, hit-by-pitches, catcher's interference, and sacrifice bunts or flies are specifically excluded from this calculation, as such an appearance is not counted as an at-bat (these are not factored into batting average either)..The name is a misnomer, as the statistic is not a percentage but an average of how many bases a player achieves per at bat.It is a scale of measure whose computed value is a number from 0 to 4.This might not be readily apparent given that a Major League Baseball player's slugging percentage is almost always less than 1 (as a majority of at bats result in either 0 or 1 base).The statistic gives a double twice the value of a single, a triple three times the value, and a home run four times.[2] The slugging percentage would have to be divided by 4 to actually be a percentage (of bases achieved per at bat out of total bases possible).As a result, it is occasionally called slugging average, or simply slugging, instead.[3].A slugging percentage is always expressed as a decimal to three decimal places, and is generally spoken as if multiplied by 1000.For example, a slugging

the characteristic tart/\"goat\" flavor of the cheese.[6] They also make goat milk and cheeses more easily digestible.[7].Goat milk, and therefore goat cheeses, contain anti-inflammatory enzymes, probiotics, antioxidants, proteins, and lipids and help maintain a healthy metabolism.These fatty acids take their name from the Latin for 'goat', capra.[8] It is also high in calcium, vitamins A and K, phosphorus, thiamin, and niacin.[4] Overall, the consumption of 60 grams (2.1oz) per day of cheese (both control and enriched), within the context of a balanced hypocaloric diet and recommendations for physical activity, was effective for the reduction of body weight, body mass index and waist circumference.[9].Goat cheese is made like other cheeses.The milk is filtered to remove unwanted impurities or deposits.A curdling starter agent is added, which can be rennet, or one or more starter bacteria that affect the curds' size and eventually the cheese's consistency.Some examples of starters are Lactococcus lactis lactis, L.l.cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus.\nQ: what cheese is made from goat's milk", "output": "Reasoning: Goat cheese, or ch\u00e8vre (from the French word

is a soft buzzing sound, similar to a rolled 'r' with a fundamental frequency of around 25Hz.[3]  This sound occurs with noticeable vibrations on the surface of the body, varies in a rhythmic pattern during breathing and occurs continuously during inhalation and exhalation.The intensity and length of the purr can also vary depending on the level of arousal of the animal.[3].The mechanism by which cats purr is an object of speculation, with different hypotheses proposed.An early idea was that purring is a hemodynamic process where sound is produced as the blood runs through the thorax.[4].There is a unique \"neural oscillator\" in the cat's brain of uncertain significance.[5] Although the mechanism has not yet been fully explained, recent studies have inferred it could be the result of oscillatory mechanisms in the central nervous system.[6] Studies have also shown that purring can be caused through electrically stimulating the infundibular region of the cat's brain, suggesting central control.[7].One hypothesis, backed by electromyographic studies, is that cats produce the purring noise by using the vocal folds or the muscles of the larynx to alternately dilate and constrict the glottis rapidly, causing air vibrations during inhalation and exhalation.[8] Combined with the steady inhalation and exhalation of air as the cat breathes, a purring noise is produced

ended on November 11, 1918, leaving 17 million dead and 25 million wounded.Moreover, the Russian Civil War can in many ways be considered a continuation of World War I, as can various other conflicts in the direct aftermath of 1918..Scholars looking at the long term seek to explain why two rival sets of powers (the German Empire and Austria-Hungary against the Russian Empire, France, the British Empire and later the United States) came into conflict by 1915.They look at such factors as political, territorial and economic competition; militarism, a complex web of alliances and alignments; imperialism, the growth of nationalism; and the power vacuum created by the decline of the Ottoman Empire.Other important long-term or structural factors that are often studied include unresolved territorial disputes, the perceived breakdown of the European balance of power,[1][2] convoluted and fragmented governance, arms races and security dilemmas,[3][4] a cult of the offensive,[1][5][4] and military planning.[6].Scholars seeking short-term analysis focus on the summer of 1914 and ask whether the conflict could have been stopped, or instead whether deeper causes made it inevitable.Among the immediate causes were the decisions made by statesmen and generals during the July Crisis, which was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by the Bosnian Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip, who had been supported by a nationalist organization in Serbia.[7] The crisis escalated as the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia was joined by their allies Russia, Germany, France, and ultimately Belgium and the United Kingdom.Other factors that came into play during the diplomatic crisis leading up to the war included misperceptions of intent (such as the German belief that Britain would remain neutral), the fatalistic belief that war was inevitable, and the speed with which the crisis escalated, partly due to delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications..The crisis followed a series of diplomatic clashes among the Great Powers (Italy, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary and Russia) over European and colonial issues in the decades before 1914 that had left tensions high.And the cause of the public clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe that had been taking place since 1867.[8].Consensus on the origins of the war remains elusive, since historians disagree on key factors and place differing emphasis on a variety of factors.\nQ: what caused ww", "output": "Reasoning:

involves the transfer of goods, services, money, or a promise to transfer any of those at a future date, and the activities and intentions of the parties entering into a contract may be referred to as contracting.In the event of a breach of contract, the injured party may seek judicial remedies such as damages or rescission.[1] A binding agreement between actors in international law is known as a treaty..Contract law, the field of the law of obligations concerned with contracts, is based on the principle that agreements must be honoured.[2] Like other areas of private law, contract law varies between jurisdictions.In general, contract law is exercised and governed either under common law jurisdictions, civil law jurisdictions, or mixed-law jurisdictions that combine elements of both common and civil law.Common law jurisdictions typically require contracts to include consideration in order to be valid, whereas civil and most mixed-law jurisdictions solely require a meeting of the minds between the parties..Within the overarching category of civil law jurisdictions, there are several distinct varieties of contract law with their own distinct criteria: the German tradition is characterised by the unique doctrine of abstraction, systems based on the Napoleonic Code are characterised by their systematic distinction between different types of contracts, and Roman-Dutch law is largely based on the writings of renaissance-era Dutch jurists and case law applying general principles of Roman law prior to the Netherlands' adoption of the Napoleonic Code.The UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, published in 2016, aim to provide a general harmonised framework for international contracts, independent of the divergences between national laws, as well as a statement of common contractual principles for arbitrators and judges to apply where national laws are lacking.Notably, the Principles reject the doctrine of consideration, arguing that elimination of the doctrine \"bring[s] about greater certainty and reduce litigation\" in international trade.[3] The Principles also rejected the abstraction principle on the grounds that it and similar doctrines are \"not easily compatible with modern business perceptions and practice\".[3].Contract law can be contrasted with tort law (also referred to in some jurisdictions as the law of delicts), the other major area of the law of obligations.While tort law generally deals with private duties and obligations that exist by operation of law, and provide remedies for civil wrongs committed between individuals not in a pre-existing legal relationship, contract law provides for the creation and enforcement of duties and obligations through a prior agreement between parties.The emergence of quasi-contracts, quasi-torts, and quasi-delicts renders the boundary between tort and contract law somewhat uncertain.[4].\nQ: what kind of legal remedy is it to ask someone to fulfill there promise",

NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as a member of the Mountain West Conference.The Broncos play their home games on campus at Albertsons Stadium in Boise, Idaho, and their head coach is Andy Avalos.The program is 13\u20137 in bowl games since 1999, has finished in the top 25 13 times since 2002, has the longest current streak of winning seasons in college football with 25.It also has a 3\u20130 record in the Fiesta Bowl.As of the end of the 2022 season, the Broncos' all-time winning percentage of .728 is the fifth highest in all of collegiate football.[2].Originally a junior college, Boise State first fielded a football team in 1933 under head coach Dusty Kline.[3] That team compiled a record of 1\u20132\u20131 (.375).[3][4] Kline was succeeded by Max Eiden.[4] Under Eiden, the Broncos posted a record of 11\u201317\u20131 (.397) from 1934 to 1937.[4] Eiden was succeeded by Harry Jacoby, who coached the team from 1938 to the middle of the 1941 season before being called into Army service.The remainder of the 1941 season was coached by George \"Stub\" Allison, who posted a record of 2\u20131 (.667).[4] The Broncos did not compete in intramural football from 1942 to 1945 due to having a reduced male student population during World War II.[4] Following the war, Jacoby would return to coach the Broncos for one more season in 1946, posting a final record of 14\u201315\u20132 (.484).After a year as an assistant, Lyle Smith was promoted to head football coach of Boise Junior College in 1947.Smith saw incredible success as head coach, winning his first 31 games in a row as head coach.In 1950, the team moved into a new 10,000-seat stadium.With the outbreak of the Korean War, Smith, still undefeated as a head coach, was recalled to the Navy and was only able to coach in the first three games of the 1950 season.[5][6] George Blankley assumed the head coaching duties for the remainder of 1950 and the entire 1951 season in Smith's absence and compiled a 16\u20132 (.889) record.Smith returned as head coach in 1952 and stretched his winning streak all the way to 37 games before suffering his first defeat.\nQ: what division is boise state football",

of committing a crime.In common law jurisdictions, most crimes require proof both of mens rea and actus reus (\"guilty act\") before the defendant can be found guilty..The standard common law test of criminal liability is expressed in the Latin phrase actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea,[2] i.e.\"the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty\".[3][4] As a general rule, someone who acted without mental fault is not liable in criminal law.[5][6] Exceptions are known as strict liability crimes.[7][8][9] Moreover, when a person intends a harm, but as a result of bad aim or other cause the intent is transferred from an intended victim to an unintended victim, the case is considered to be a matter of transferred intent.[10]:\u200a63\u201364\u200a[11].The types of mental states that apply to crimes vary depending on whether a jurisdiction follows criminal law under the common law tradition or, within the United States, according to the Model Penal Code.[12].In civil law, it is usually not necessary to prove a subjective mental element to establish liability for breach of contract or tort, for example.But if a tort is intentionally committed or a contract is intentionally breached, such intent may increase the scope of liability and the damages payable to the plaintiff..In some jurisdictions, the terms mens rea and actus reus have been replaced by alternative terminology.[13]:\u200a95\u200a[14]:\u200a84.Under the tradition of common law, judges would often require a \"bad state of mind\" in addition to an action or omission (actus reus) to find a criminal guilty.[15][16][17] Over time, culpable mental states (mens rea) became varied among different types of crimes.[15] Such crimes and mental states might include, for example, \"malice\" for murder, \"fraudulence\" for fraud, \"willfulness and corruption\" for perjury, and so on.[15] The crime of manslaughter, further, might not even require a \"bad mind\" but simply a \"negligent\" one.[15] Regardless of how the requirements are categorized, the Supreme Court has explained mens rea requirements for crimes are \"universal\" and essential to \"mature systems of law\", even going so far as to say that this belief undergirds notions of free will and morality.[18].Within the United States, there is no single encompassing criminal law.Criminal laws are passed and enforced by the states\u201a or the federal government, but each of these criminal \"codes\" vary and may or may not draw from the same theoretical sources.[19].The vast majority of criminal prosecutions in the United States are carried out by the several states in accordance with the laws of the state in question.\nQ: What does the term \"mens rea\" mean", "output": "Reasoning: Mens rea is Latin for

oral fluid/saliva\u2014to determine the presence or absence of specified parent drugs or their metabolites.Major applications of drug testing include detection of the presence of performance enhancing steroids in sport, employers and parole/probation officers screening for drugs prohibited by law (such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin) and police officers testing for the presence and concentration of alcohol (ethanol) in the blood commonly referred to as BAC (blood alcohol content).BAC tests are typically administered via a breathalyzer while urinalysis is used for the vast majority of drug testing in sports and the workplace.Numerous other methods with varying degrees of accuracy, sensitivity (detection threshold/cutoff), and detection periods exist..A drug test may also refer to a test that provides quantitative chemical analysis of an illegal drug, typically intended to help with responsible drug use.[1].The detection windows depend upon multiple factors: drug class, amount and frequency of use, metabolic rate, body mass, age, overall health, and urine pH.For ease of use, the detection times of metabolites have been incorporated into each parent drug.For example, heroin and cocaine can only be detected for a few hours after use, but their metabolites can be detected for several days in urine.The chart depicts the longer detection times of the metabolites.In the case of hair testing, the metabolytes are permanently embedded into hair, and the detection time is determined by the length of the hair sample used in the analysis.The standard length of head hair used in the test is 1.5\", which corresponds to about 3 months.Body/pubic hair grows slower, and the same  1.5\" would result in a longer detection time.[2].\nQ: what do UA's

coffee-brewing methods, of Italian origin.[1][2] The French also made a significant contribution to the invention of the first coffee makers, predecessors of today's espresso machines, and generally to the caf\u00e9 culture.Espresso can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under pressure through finely-ground coffee beans.Espresso is the most common way of making coffee in southern Europe, especially in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and Greece, but it is also popular in the rest of the world..Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, with a viscosity similar to that of warm honey.This is due to the higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and the crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).[3] As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated..Espresso contains more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, but as its usual serving size of 25\u201330 ml (1 US oz) is much smaller than other coffee drinks, the overall caffeine content of a single serving of espresso is generally lower than that of other coffees.[4] While the exact caffeine content of any coffee drink will vary, a typical 30 millilitres (1 US fluid ounce) serving of espresso contains approximately 65 milligrams of caffeine, but a typical 240 millilitres (8 US fluid ounces) serving of drip coffee contains between 150 and 200mg of caffeine.[5][6][7].The three dispersed phases in espresso are what make this beverage unique.The first dispersed phase is an emulsion of oil droplets.The second phase is suspended solids, while the third is the layer of gas bubbles or foam.The dispersion of very small oil droplets is perceived in the mouth as creamy.This characteristic of espresso contributes to what is known as the body of the beverage.These oil droplets preserve some of the aromatic compounds that are lost to the air in other coffee forms, enhancing the strong flavor of espresso.[8].\nQ: how much caffeine is in a shot of espresso", "output": "Reasoning: Espresso has more caffeine

{"input": "Context: \"My two cents\" (\"my 2\u00a2\") and its longer version \"put my two cents in\" is an American and Australian idiomatic expression,[1] taken from the original English idiom \"to put in my two-penny worth\"..The earliest reference to an analogue of \"two cents/pence\" appears in the lesson of the widow's mite from both the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Luke.In the biblical episode, several wealthy temple patrons donate large sums of money, while a poor widow places just two small coins into the offering.She finds greater favour with Jesus than the wealthy patrons however, as the two coins constitute her whole wealth, as opposed to a tiny fraction from the rich merchants of theirs..A possible origin may be from boxing in Nottingham during the 1900s.Jack Jetlamey, a well-known gambler despite the little money he had, was always willing to bet on Jack Johnson, a new hopeful boxer.Jetlamey was known to say \"two, two, two my two cents in for Johnson\", making the whole audience laugh at every match.[2].Other likely origins are that \"my two pennies worth\" is derived from the much older 16th-century English expression, \"a penny for your thoughts\", possibly a sarcastic response to receiving more opinion than was wanted \"I said a penny for your thoughts, but I got two pennies' worth\".There is also some belief that the idiom may have its origins in the early cost of postage in England, the \"twopenny post\", where two pennies was the normal charge of sending a letter containing one's words and thoughts or feelings to someone.[3][4].The expression is used to preface a tentative statement of one\u2019s opinion.By deprecating the opinion to follow\u2014suggesting its value is only two cents, a very small amount\u2014the user of the phrase, showing politeness and humility, hopes to lessen the impact of a possibly contentious statement..The expression is also sometimes used to preface uncontentious opinions.\nQ: what does add my

others.[1] It may be assessed through either income or wealth..In absolute terms affluence is a relatively widespread phenomenon in the United States, with over 30% of households having an income exceeding $100,000 per year and over 30% of households having a net worth exceeding $250,000, as of 2019.[2][3] However, when looked at in relative terms, wealth is highly concentrated: the bottom 50% of Americans only share 2% of total household wealth while the top 1% hold 35% of that wealth..In the United States, as of 2019, the median household income is $60,030 per year and the median household net worth is $97,300, while the mean household income is $89,930 per year and the mean household net worth is $692,100.[2][3].While income is often seen as a type of wealth in colloquial language use, wealth and income are two substantially different measures of economic prosperity.Wealth is the total value of net possessions of an individual or household, while income is the total inflow of monetary assets over a given time period.Hence the change in wealth over that time period is equal to the income minus the expenditures in that period.Income is a so-called \"flow\" variable, while wealth is a so-called \"stock\" variable..Affluence in the United States has been attributed in many cases to inherited wealth amounting to \"a substantial head start\":[6][7] in September 2012, the Institute for Policy Studies found that over 60 percent of the Forbes richest 400 Americans had grown up with substantial privilege.[8].Income is commonly used to measure affluence, although this is a relative indicator: a middle class person with a personal income of $77,500 annually and a billionaire may both be referred to as affluent, depending on reference groups.An average American with a median income of $32,000[9] ($39,000 for those employed full-time between the ages of 25 and 64)[10] when used as a reference group would justify the personal income in the tenth percentile of $77,500 being described as affluent,[9] but if this earner were compared to an executive of a Fortune 500 company, then the description would not apply.[11][12] Accordingly, marketing firms and investment houses classify those with household incomes exceeding $250,000 as mass affluent, while the threshold upper class is most commonly defined as the top 1% with household incomes commonly exceeding $525,000 annually..According to the U.S.Census Bureau, 42% of U.S.\nQ: how much total wealth in USA", "output": "Reasoning: Including human capital such as skills, the

world record and gaining fame as \"an all-American hero\".[4] Jenner established a career in television, film, writing, auto racing, business, and as a Playgirl cover model.[5].Jenner has six children with three successive wives\u2013Chrystie Crownover, Linda Thompson, and Kris Jenner\u2013and from 2007 to 2021 appeared on the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians with Kris, their daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, as well as Kris's other children from her previous marriage, Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob Kardashian..Jenner publicly came out as a trans woman in April 2015, announcing her new name in July of that year.[6] From 2015 to 2016, she starred in the reality television series I Am Cait, which focused on her gender transition.At the time of her coming out, she had been called the most famous trans woman in the world.[7][8] Jenner is a transgender rights activist,[9][10][11] although her views on transgender issues have been criticized by many other LGBTQ+ activists.[12][13].A member of the Republican Party, Jenner ran as a replacement candidate in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election.[14][15][16] The recall failed, and she only received one percent of the vote, finishing in 13th place among the candidates running to replace governor Gavin Newsom.[17] Six months after the election, Jenner was hired by Fox News as an on-air contributor.[18].Caitlyn Marie Jenner was born on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York, as William Bruce Jenner, and was known as Bruce until June 2015.[19] Her parents are Esther Ruth (n\u00e9e McGuire) and William Hugh Jenner, who was an arborist originally from New Brunswick, Canada.[20][21] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, and Welsh descent.[22] Her younger brother, Burt, was killed in a car accident in Canton, Connecticut, on November 30, 1976, shortly after Jenner's success at the Olympic Games.[23][24] As a child, Jenner was diagnosed with dyslexia.[25].Jenner attended Sleepy Hollow High School in Sleepy Hollow, New York, for her freshman and sophomore years[26][27] and Newtown High School in Newtown, Connecticut, for her junior and senior years, graduating in 1968.[28] Jenner earned a football scholarship and attended Graceland College (now Graceland University) in Lamoni, Iowa, but was forced to stop playing football because of a knee injury.[29] Recognizing Jenner's potential, Graceland track coach L.D.Weldon encouraged Jenner to switch to the decathlon.[30] Jenner debuted as a decathlete in 1970 in the Drake Relays decathlon in Des Moines, Iowa, finishing in fifth place.[31] Jenner graduated from Graceland College in 1973 with a degree in physical education.[32].At the 1972 U.S.Olympic Trials at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, Jenner was eleventh after the first day in the men's decathlon,[33] and climbed to fifth behind Steve Gough and Andrew Pettes with one event remaining on the Fourth of July.[34] Needing to make up a 19-second gap on Gough in the 1500 meters, Jenner qualified for the Olympic team by finishing first, 22 seconds ahead of the others.\nQ: what does bruce jenner do", "output": "Reasoning: William Bruce

Initiative as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers (nm).At this scale, commonly known as the nanoscale, surface area and quantum mechanical effects become important in describing properties of matter.The definition of nanotechnology is inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with these special properties.It is therefore common to see the plural form \"nanotechnologies\" as well as \"nanoscale technologies\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size.[1] An earlier description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology.[2].Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage,[3][4] engineering,[5] microfabrication,[6] and molecular engineering.[7] The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly,[8] from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale..Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology.Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products.On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials,[9] and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios.These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted..The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by physicist Richard Feynman in his talk There's Plenty

However, this expenditure does not necessarily translate into better overall health outcomes compared to other developed nations.[5] Coverage varies widely across the population, with certain groups, such as the elderly and low-income individuals, receiving more comprehensive care through government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare..The U.S.healthcare system has been the subject of significant political debate and reform efforts, particularly in the areas of healthcare costs, insurance coverage, and the quality of care.Legislation such as the Affordable Care Act of 2010 has sought to address some of these issues, though challenges remain..Uninsured rates have fluctuated over time, and disparities in access to care exist based on factors such as income, race, and geographical location.[6][7][8][9] The private insurance model predominates, and employer-sponsored insurance is a common way for individuals to obtain coverage.[1][10][11] The complex nature of the

or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit), or white pepper (ripe fruit seeds).[2].Black pepper is native to the Malabar Coast[3][4] of India, and the Malabar pepper is extensively cultivated there and in other tropical regions..Ground, dried, and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a traditional medicine.Black pepper is the world's most traded spice,[5] and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world.Its spiciness is due to the chemical compound piperine, which is a different kind of spicy from the capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers.It is ubiquitous in the Western world as a seasoning, and is often paired with salt and available on dining tables in shakers or mills..The word pepper derives from Old English pipor, Latin piper, and Greek: \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9.[6] The Greek likely derives from Dravidian pippali, meaning \"long pepper\".[7]

back to the string telephone or lover's telephone that has been known for centuries, comprising two diaphragms connected by a taut string or wire.Sound waves are carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other.The classic example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, paper cups or similar items.The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the voice sounds for reproduction at a distance.One precursor to the development of the electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices.Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.[1].In 1840, American Charles Grafton Page passed an electric current through a coil of wire placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet.He observed that connecting and disconnecting the current caused a ringing sound in the magnet.He called this effect \"galvanic music\".[2].Innocenzo Manzetti considered the idea of a telephone as early as 1844, and

road surface, usually asphalt pavement, where traffic has removed broken pieces of the pavement.It is usually the result of water in the underlying soil structure and traffic passing over the affected area.Water first weakens the underlying soil; traffic then fatigues and breaks the poorly supported asphalt surface in the affected area.Continued traffic action ejects both asphalt and the underlying soil material to create a hole in the pavement.[1].According to the US Army Corps of Engineers's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, pothole formation requires two factors to be present at the same time: water and traffic.Water weakens the soil beneath the pavement while traffic applies the loads that stress the pavement past the breaking point.Potholes form progressively from fatigue of the road surface which can lead to a precursor failure pattern known as crocodile (or alligator) cracking.[2] Eventually, chunks of pavement between the fatigue cracks gradually work loose, and may then be plucked or forced out of the surface by continued wheel loads to create a pothole.[3].In areas subject to freezing and thawing, frost heaving can damage a pavement and create openings for water to enter.In the spring, thaw of pavements accelerates this process when the thawing of upper portions of the soil structure in a pavement cannot drain past still-frozen lower layers, thus saturating the supporting soil and weakening it.[3].Potholes can grow to several feet in width, though they usually only develop to depths of a few inches.If they become large enough, damage to tires, wheels, and vehicle suspensions is liable to occur.Serious road accidents can occur as a direct result, especially on those roads where vehicle speeds are greater.[3].\nQ: How is the pothole formed",

small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine.RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 90\u201395% of cases.[1] RCC occurrence shows a male predominance over women with a ratio of 1.5:1.RCC most commonly occurs between 6th and 7th decade of life.[2].Initial treatment is most commonly either partial or complete removal of the affected kidney(s).[3] Where the cancer has not metastasised (spread to other organs) or burrowed deeper into the tissues of the kidney, the five-year survival rate is 65\u201390%,[4] but this is lowered considerably when the cancer has spread..The body is remarkably good at hiding the symptoms and as a result people with RCC often have advanced disease by the time it is discovered.[5] The initial symptoms of RCC often include blood in the urine (occurring in 40% of affected persons at the time they first seek medical attention), flank pain (40%), a mass in the abdomen or flank (25%), weight loss (33%), fever (20%), high blood pressure (20%), night sweats and generally feeling unwell.[1] When RCC metastasises, it most commonly spreads to the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, adrenal glands, brain or bones.[6] Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have improved the outlook for metastatic RCC.[7][8].RCC is also associated with a number of paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) which are conditions caused by either the hormones produced by the tumour or by the body's attack on the tumour and are present in about 20% of those with RCC.[1] These syndromes most commonly affect tissues which have not been invaded by the cancer.[1] The most common PNSs seen in people with RCC are: high blood calcium levels, high red blood cell count, high platelet count and secondary amyloidosis.[6].Historically, medical practitioners expected a person to present with three findings.This classic triad[9] is 1: haematuria, which is when there is blood present in the urine, 2: flank pain, which is pain on the side of the body between the hip and ribs, and 3: an abdominal mass, similar to bloating but larger.It is now known that this classic triad of symptoms only occurs in 10\u201315% of cases, and is usually indicative that the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is in an advanced stage.[9] Today, RCC is often asymptomatic (meaning few to no symptoms) and is generally detected incidentally when a person is being examined for other ailments.[10].Other signs and symptom may include haematuria;[9] loin pain;[9] abdominal mass;[10] malaise, which is a general feeling of unwellness;[10] weight loss and/or loss of appetite;[11] anaemia resulting from depression of erythropoietin;[9] erythrocytosis (increased production of red blood cells) due to increased erythropoietin secretion;[9] varicocele, which is seen in males as an enlargement of the pampiniform plexus of veins draining the testis (more often the left testis)[10] hypertension (high blood pressure) resulting from secretion of renin by the tumour;[12] hypercalcemia, which is elevation of calcium levels in the blood;[13] sleep disturbance or night sweats;[11] recurrent fevers;[11] and chronic fatigue.[14].The greatest risk factors for RCC are lifestyle-related; smoking, obesity and hypertension (high blood pressure) have been estimated to account for up to 50% of cases.[15].Occupational exposure to some chemicals such as asbestos, cadmium, lead, chlorinated solvents, petrochemicals and PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has been examined by multiple studies

until his death..Maximilian was an ambitious leader who was active in many fields and lived in a time of great upheaval between the Medieval and Early Modern worlds, Maximilian's reputation in historiography is many-sided, often contradictory: the last knight or the first modern foot soldier and \"first cannoneer of his nation\";[1][2] the first Renaissance prince (understood either as a Machiavellian politician[3] or omnicompetent, universal genius[4]) or a dilettante;[5] a far-sighted state builder and reformer, or an unrealistic schemer whose posthumous successes were based on luck,[6] or a clear-headed, prudent statesman.[7] While Austrian researchers often emphasize his role as the founder of the early modern supremacy of the House of Habsburg or founder of the nation,[8] debates on Maximilian's political activities in Germany as well as international scholarship on his reign as Holy Roman Emperor often centre on the Imperial Reform.In the Burgundian Low Countries (and the modern Netherlands and Belgium), in scholarly circles as well as popular imagination, his depictions vary as well: a foreign tyrant who imposed wars, taxes, high-handed methods of ruling and suspicious personal agenda, and then \"abandoned\" the Low Countries after gaining the imperial throne, or a saviour and builder of the early modern state.Jelle Haemers calls the relationship between the Low Countries and Maximilian \"a troubled marriage\".[9][10].In his lifetime, as the first ruler who exploited the propaganda potential of the printing press,[11] he attempted to control his own depictions, although various projects (called Gedechtnus) that he commissioned (and authored in part by him in some cases) were only finished after his death.Various authors refer to the emperor's image-building programs as \"unprecedented\".[12][13][14] Historian Thomas Brady Jr.remarks that Maximilian's humanists, artists, and printers \"created for him a virtual royal self of hitherto unimagined quality and intensity.They half-captured and half-invented a rich past, which progressed from ancient Rome through the line of Charlemagne to the glory of the house of Habsburg and culminated in Maximilian's own high presidency of the Christian brotherhood of warrior-kings.\"[15].Additionally, as his legends have many spontaneous sources, the Gedechtnus projects themselves are just one of the many tributaries of the early modern Maximiliana stream.Today, according to Elaine C.Tennant, it is impossible to determine the degree modern attention and reception to Maximilian (what Tennant dubs \"the Maximilian industry\") are influenced by the self-advertising program the emperor set in motion 500 years ago.[16] According to historian Thomas Martin Lindsay, the scholars and artists in service of the emperor could not expect much financial rewards or prestigious offices, but just like the peasantry, they genuinely loved the emperor for his romanticism, amazing intellectual versatility and other qualities.Thus, he \"lives in the folk-song of Germany like no other ruler does.\"[17] Maximilian Kr\u00fcger remarks that, although the most known of all Habsburgs, and a ruler so markedly different from all who came before him and his contemporaries, Maximilian's reputation is fading outside of the scientific ivory tower, due to general problems within German education and a culture self-defined as post-heroic and post-national.[18].Maximilian is the subject of several legends and anecdotes, which themselves would later produce inspirations for

enormous amounts of sound energy, sounding similar to an explosion or a thunderclap to the human ear..The crack of a supersonic bullet passing overhead or the crack of a bullwhip are examples of a sonic boom in miniature.[2].Sonic booms due to large supersonic aircraft can be particularly loud and startling, tend to awaken people, and may cause minor damage to some structures.This led to the prohibition of routine supersonic flight overland.Although they cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle, the nuisance due to the sonic booms may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a feasible option.[3][4].A sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the sound barrier and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the supersonic object.Rather, the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is traveling at supersonic speeds and affects only observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object.As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the

waves created by a boat.These waves travel at the speed of sound and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other's

fungi.It reproduces during the summer..Previously considered a critically endangered species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species[6] due to a series of factors (including anthropic influence[7]), the Kanab ambersnail had been reintroduced to three springs above the historic high water level along the Colorado River..The snail had been listed as endangered on the United States

diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes.Affected children also grow much more slowly than healthy children and some have developmental delay.Most individuals with ADA deficiency are diagnosed with SCID in the first 6 months of life.[citation needed].An association with polyarteritis nodosa has been reported.[3].The enzyme adenosine deaminase is encoded by the ADA gene on chromosome 20.[1] ADA deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 20 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder.The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.[citation needed].\nQ: what causes a deficiency in adenosine deaminase", "output": "Reasoning: Adenosine deaminase deficiency, also called ADA deficiency or ADA-SCID, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that causes immunodeficiency ."}, {"input": "Context: Human height or stature is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human body, standing erect.It is measured using a stadiometer,[1] in centimetres when using the metric system or SI system,[2][3] or feet and inches when using United States customary units or the imperial system.[4][5].In the early phase of anthropometric research history, questions about height techniques for measuring nutritional status often concerned genetic differences.[6].Height is also important because it is closely correlated with other health components, such as life expectancy.[6] Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature and a longer life expectancy.Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure and are less likely to acquire cancer.The University of Hawaii has found that the \"longevity gene\" FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of small body size.[7] Short stature decreases the risk of venous insufficiency.[8].When populations share genetic backgrounds and environmental factors, average height is frequently characteristic within the group.Exceptional height variation (around 20% deviation from average) within such a population is sometimes due to gigantism or dwarfism, which are medical conditions caused by specific genes or endocrine abnormalities.[9].The development of human height can serve as an indicator of two key welfare components, namely nutritional quality and health.[10] In regions of poverty or warfare, environmental factors like chronic malnutrition during childhood or adolescence may result in delayed growth and/or marked reductions in adult stature even without the presence of any of these medical conditions..The study of height is known as auxology.[11] Growth has long been recognized as a measure of the health of individuals, hence part of the reasoning for the use of growth charts.For individuals, as indicators of health problems, growth trends are tracked for significant deviations, and growth is also monitored for significant deficiency from genetic expectations.Genetics is a major factor in determining the height of individuals, though it is far less influential regarding differences among populations.\nQ: how is human height measured", "output": "Reasoning: Human height is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human

cultivation, and (in regards to medical) how it can be consumed and what medical conditions it can be used for.These policies in most countries are regulated by three United Nations treaties: the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.[1][2] Since its descheduling in 2020, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug under the Single Convention treaty, meaning that signatories can allow medical use but that it is considered to be an addictive drug with a serious risk of abuse.[3][4].The use of cannabis for recreational purposes is prohibited in most countries; however, many have adopted a policy of decriminalization to make simple possession a non-criminal offense (often similar to a minor traffic violation).Others have much more severe penalties such as some Asian and Middle Eastern countries where possession of even small amounts is punished by imprisonment for several years.[5] Countries that have legalized recreational use of cannabis are Canada, Georgia, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, and Uruguay, plus 24 states, 3 territories, and the District of Columbia in the United States and the Australian Capital Territory in Australia.Commercial sale of recreational cannabis is legalized nationwide in three countries (Canada, Thailand, and Uruguay) and in all subnational U.S.jurisdictions that have legalized possession except Virginia and Washington, D.C.A policy of limited enforcement has also been adopted in many countries, in particular the Netherlands where the sale of cannabis is tolerated at licensed coffeeshops.[6].Countries that have legalized medical use of cannabis include Albania,

cavities in the body of an organism and covers the surface of internal organs.It consists of one or more layers of epithelial cells overlying a layer of loose connective tissue.It is mostly of endodermal origin and is continuous with the skin at body openings such as the eyes, eyelids, ears, inside the nose, inside the mouth, lips, the genital areas, the urethral opening and the anus.Some mucous membranes secrete mucus, a thick protective fluid.The function of the membrane is to stop pathogens and dirt from entering the body and to prevent bodily tissues from becoming dehydrated..The mucosa is composed of one or more layers of epithelial cells that secrete mucus, and an underlying lamina propria of loose connective tissue.[1] The type of cells and type of mucus secreted vary from organ to organ and each can differ along a given tract.[2][3].Mucous membranes line the digestive, respiratory and reproductive tracts and are the primary barrier between the external world and the interior of the body; in an adult human the total surface area of the mucosa is about 400 square meters while the surface area of the skin is about 2 square meters.[4]:\u200a1\u200a Along with

have his first marriage (to Catherine of Aragon) annulled.His disagreement with Pope Clement VII about such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation, separating the Church of England from papal authority.He appointed himself Supreme Head of the Church of England and dissolved convents and monasteries, for which he was excommunicated by the pope..Henry is known for his radical changes to the Constitution of England, expanding royal power and ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings in opposition to papal supremacy.He frequently used charges of treason and heresy to quell dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial using bills of attainder.He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour.Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in his administration..Henry was an extravagant spender, using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament.He converted the money that was formerly paid to Rome into royal revenue.Despite the money from these sources, he was often on the verge of financial ruin due to personal extravagance as well as costly and largely unproductive wars, particularly with King Francis I of France, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, King James V of Scotland and the Scottish regency under the Earl of Arran and Mary of Guise.He expanded the Royal Navy, oversaw the annexation of Wales to England with the Laws in

(lit.\u2009'male'), which are joined by a wooden bridge.They are played with both hands and usually held between the legs, although in some cases, as in classical music, they may be played with sticks or mounted on stands..Bongos are mainly employed in the rhythm section of son cubano and salsa ensembles, often alongside other drums such as the larger congas and the stick-struck timbales.In these groups, the bongo player is known as bongosero and often plays a continuous eight-stroke pattern called martillo (lit.\u2009'hammer') as well as more rhythmically free parts, providing improvisatory flourishes and rhythmic counterpoint.[2].Bongos originated in eastern Cuba at the end of the 19th century, possibly from a pair of larger drums such as the bok\u00fa.These older, larger bongos are known as bong\u00f3 del monte and played in chang\u00fc\u00ed.The smaller bongos used in son cubano were popular across Cuba by the 1910s and reached the concert halls of the eastern United States in

molecular biology, zoology, and evolutionary biology) of biology[3] and have a specific research focus (e.g., studying malaria or cancer).[4].Biologists who are involved in basic research have the aim of advancing knowledge about the natural world.[1] They conduct their research using the scientific method, which is an empirical method for testing hypotheses.[1][5] Their discoveries may have applications for some specific purpose such as in biotechnology, which has the goal of developing medically useful products for humans.[1][6].In modern times, most biologists have one or more academic degrees such as a bachelor's degree plus an advanced degree like a master's degree or a doctorate.[3][7][8] Like other scientists, biologists can be found working in different sectors of the economy such as in academia, nonprofits, private industry, or government.[9].Francesco Redi, the founder of biology, is recognized to be one of the greatest biologists of all time.[10] Robert Hooke, an English natural philosopher, coined the term cell, suggesting plant structure's resemblance to honeycomb cells.[11].Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace independently formulated the theory of evolution by natural selection, which was described in detail in Darwin's book On the Origin of Species, which was published in 1859.In it, Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes of descent with accumulated modification leading to divergence over long periods of time.The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology.[12] Separately, Gregor Mendel formulated in the principles of inheritance in 1866, which became the basis of modern genetics..In 1953, James D.Watson and Francis Crick described the basic structure of DNA, the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms,[13] building on the work of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, suggested that the structure of DNA was a double helix..Ian Wilmut led a research group that in 1996 first cloned a mammal from an adult somatic cell, a Finnish Dorset lamb named Dolly.[14][15][16][17].An undergraduate degree in biology typically requires coursework in molecular and cellular biology, development, ecology, genetics, microbiology, anatomy, physiology, botany, and zoology.[8][18] Additional requirements may include physics, chemistry (general, organic, and biochemistry), calculus, and statistics..Students who aspire to a research-oriented career usually pursue a graduate degree such as a master\u2019s or a doctorate (e.g., PhD) whereby they would receive training from a research head based on an apprenticeship model that has been in existence since the 1800s.[7] Students in these graduate programs often receive

El Capitan, made using ram-air parachutes and the freefall tracking technique.[8] While BASE jumps had been made prior to that time, the El Capitan activity was the effective birth of what is now called BASE jumping..After 1978, the filmed jumps from El Capitan were repeated, not as an actual publicity exercise or as a movie stunt, but as a true recreational activity.It was this that popularized BASE jumping more widely among parachutists.[9] Carl Boenish continued to publish films and informational magazines on BASE jumping until his death in 1984 after a BASE jump off the Troll Wall.By this time, the concept had spread among skydivers worldwide, with hundreds of participants making fixed-object jumps..During the early eighties, nearly all BASE jumps were made using standard skydiving equipment, including two parachutes (main and reserve), and deployment components.Later on, specialized equipment and techniques were developed specifically for the unique needs of BASE jumping..\nQ: what does base jumping stand for", "output": "Reasoning: \"BASE\" is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: buildings , antennas , spans (

deposited on the floor from ceiling drippings.Stalagmites are typically composed of calcium carbonate, but may consist of lava, mud, peat, pitch, sand, sinter, and amberat (crystallized urine of pack rats).[2][3].The corresponding formation hanging down from the ceiling of a cave is a stalactite.Mnemonics have been developed for which word refers to which type of formation; one is that stalactite has a C for \"ceiling\", and stalagmite has a G for \"ground\",[4] another is that, as with ants in the pants, the mites go up and the tights (tites) come down..The most common stalagmites are speleothems, which usually form in limestone caves.[5] Stalagmite formation occurs only under certain pH conditions within the cavern.They form through deposition of calcium carbonate and other minerals, which is precipitated from mineralized water solutions.Limestone is the chief form of calcium carbonate rock,  which is dissolved by water that contains carbon dioxide, forming a calcium bicarbonate solution in caverns.[6] The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the water must be greater than the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the cave chamber for conventional stalagmite growth.[7].If stalactites \u2013 the ceiling formations \u2013 grow long enough to connect with stalagmites on the floor, they form a column..Stalagmites should normally not be touched, since the rock buildup is formed by minerals precipitating out of the water solution onto the existing surface; skin oils can alter the surface tension where the mineral water clings or flows, thus affecting the growth of the formation.Oils and dirt (mud, clay) from human contact can also stain the formation and change its color permanently..Another type of stalagmite is formed in lava tubes while molten and

sanction.The right to freedom of expression has been recognised as a human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights law by the United Nations.Many countries have constitutional law that protects free speech.Terms like free speech, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression are used interchangeably in political discourse.However, in a legal sense, the freedom of expression includes any activity of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used..Article 19 of the UDHR states that \"everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference\" and \"everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice\".The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries \"special duties and responsibilities\" and may \"therefore be subject to certain restrictions\" when necessary \"[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others\" or \"[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals\".[2].Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, may not be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, hate speech, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, dignity, the right to be forgotten, public security, and perjury.Justifications for such include the harm principle, proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, which suggests that \"the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\".[3].The idea of the \"offense principle\" is also used to justify speech limitations, describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, and ease with which it could be avoided.[3] With the evolution of the digital age, application of freedom of speech becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise, for example, the Golden Shield Project, an initiative by Chinese government's Ministry of Public Security that filters potentially unfavourable data from foreign countries..The Human Rights Measurement Initiative[4] measures the right to opinion and expression for countries around the world, using a survey of in-country human rights experts.[5].Freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern international human rights instruments.[6] It is thought that the ancient Athenian democratic principle of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century BC.[7].\nQ: what does freedom of speech cover", "output": "Reasoning: Freedom of speech is the political right

puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12,[3] psychiatric diagnostic criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13.[4].People with the disorder are often referred to as pedophiles (or paedophiles)..Pedophilia is a paraphilia.In recent versions of formal diagnostic coding systems such as the DSM-5 and ICD-11, \"pedophilia\" is distinguished from \"pedophilic disorder.\" Pedophilic disorder is defined a pattern of pedophilic arousal accompanied by either subjective distress or interpersonal difficulty, or having acted on that arousal.The DSM-5 requires that a person must be at least 16 years old, and at least five years older than the prepubescent child or children they are aroused by, for the attraction to be diagnosed as pedophilic disorder.Similarly, the ICD-11 excludes sexual behavior among post-pubertal children who are close in age.The DSM requires the arousal pattern must be present for 6 months or longer, while the ICD lacks this requirement.The ICD criteria also refrain from specifying chronological ages.[5].In popular usage, the word pedophilia is often applied to any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse, including any sexual interest in minors below the local age of consent, regardless of their level of physical or mental development.[1][2]:\u200avii\u200a[6] This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors.[7][8]  Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided, because although some people who commit child sexual abuse are pedophiles,[6][9] child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children,[7][10][11] and many pedophiles do not molest children.[12].Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century.A

out primarily through mass shootings and poison gas in extermination camps, chiefly Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, and Che\u0142mno in occupied Poland..The Nazis developed their ideology based on racism and pursuit of \"living space\", and seized power in early 1933.In an attempt to force all German Jews to emigrate, the regime passed anti-Jewish laws and orchestrated a

larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture).The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors..Silk is produced by several insects; but, generally, only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing.There has been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level.[2] Silk is mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, but some insects, such as webspinners and raspy crickets, produce silk throughout their lives.[3] Silk production also occurs in hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), silverfish, caddisflies, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles, lacewings, fleas, flies, and midges.[2] Other types of arthropods produce silk, most notably various arachnids, such as spiders..The word silk comes from Old English: sioloc, from Latin: sericum[4] and Ancient Greek: \u03c3\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, romanized:s\u0113rik\u00f3s, \"silken\", ultimately from the Chinese word \"s\u012b\" and other Asian

places of the world (Yangshao culture, 4th millennium BC).Silk production remained confined to China until the Silk Road opened at some point during the latter part of the 1st millennium BC, though China maintained its virtual monopoly over silk production for another thousand years..Several kinds of wild silk, produced by caterpillars other than the mulberry silkworm, have been known and spun in China, South Asia, and Europe since ancient times, e.g.the production of Eri silk in Assam, India.However, the scale of production was always far smaller than for cultivated silks.There are several reasons for this: first, they differ from the domesticated varieties in colour and texture and are therefore less uniform; second, cocoons gathered in the wild have usually had the pupa emerge from them before being discovered so the silk thread that makes up the cocoon has been torn into shorter lengths; and third, many wild cocoons are covered in a mineral layer that prevents attempts to reel from them long strands of silk.[6] Thus, the only way to obtain silk suitable for spinning into textiles in areas where commercial silks are not cultivated was by tedious and labor-intensive

census of agriculture, there were 2.04 million farms, covering an area of 900million acres (1,400,000sqmi), an average of 441 acres (178 hectares) per farm.[2].Agriculture in the United States is highly mechanized, with an average of only one farmer or farm laborer required per square kilometer of farmland for agricultural production..Although agricultural activity occurs in every U.S.state, it is particularly concentrated in the Central Valley of California and in the Great Plains, a vast expanse of flat arable land in the center of the nation, in the region west of the Great Lakes and east of the Rocky Mountains.The eastern wetter half is a major corn and soybean-producing region known as the Corn Belt, and the western drier half is known as the Wheat Belt because of its high rate of wheat production.[3] The Central Valley of California produces fruits, vegetables, and nuts.The American South has historically been a large producer of cotton, tobacco, and rice, but it has declined in agricultural production over the past century.Florida leads the nation in citrus production and is the number two producer of oranges in the world behind only Brazil..The U.S.has led developments in seed improvement, such as hybridization, and in expanding uses for crops from the work of George Washington Carver to bioplastics and biofuels.The mechanization of farming and

faster than the same liquid which begins cold, under otherwise similar conditions.There is disagreement about its theoretical basis and the parameters required to produce the effect.[1][2].The Mpemba effect is named after Tanzanian scientist Erasto Bartholomeo Mpemba, who described it in 1963 as a secondary school student.The initial discovery and observations of the effect originate in ancient times; Aristotle said that it was common knowledge.[3].The phenomenon, when taken to mean \"hot water freezes faster than cold\", is difficult to reproduce or confirm because it is ill-defined.[4] Monwhea Jeng proposed a more precise wording: \"There exists a set of initial parameters, and a pair of temperatures, such that given two bodies of water identical in these parameters, and differing only in initial uniform temperatures, the hot one will freeze sooner.\"[5] Even with Jeng's definition, it is not clear whether \"freezing\" refers to the point at which water forms a visible surface layer of ice, the point at which the entire volume of water becomes a solid block of ice, or when the water reaches 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F; 273K).[4] Jeng's definition suggests simple ways in which the effect might be observed, such as if a warmer temperature melts the frost on a cooling surface, thereby increasing thermal conductivity between the cooling surface and the water container.[4] Alternatively, the Mpemba effect may not be evident in situations and under circumstances that at first seem to qualify.[4].Various effects of heat on the freezing of water were described by ancient scientists, including Aristotle: \"The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes to its freezing quickly: for so it cools sooner.Hence many people, when they want to cool water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun.\"[6] Aristotle's explanation involved antiperistasis: \"...the supposed increase in the intensity of a quality as a result of being surrounded by its contrary quality.\"[citation needed].Francis Bacon noted that \"slightly tepid water freezes more easily than that which is utterly cold.\"[7] Ren\u00e9 Descartes wrote in his Discourse on the Method, relating the phenomenon to his vortex theory: \"One can see by experience that water that has been kept on a fire for a long time freezes faster than other, the reason being that those of its particles that are least able to stop bending evaporate while the water is being heated.\"[8].Scottish scientist Joseph Black investigated a special case of the phenomenon by comparing previously-boiled with unboiled water;[9] he found that the previously-boiled water froze more quickly.Evaporation was controlled for.He discussed the influence of stirring on the results of the experiment, noting that stirring the unboiled water led to it freezing at the same time as the previously-boiled water, and also noted that stirring the very-cold unboiled water led to immediate freezing.Joseph Black then discussed Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit's description of supercooling of water, arguing that the previously-boiled water could not be as readily supercooled.[citation needed].\nQ: what freezes faster? hot

{"input": "Context: In macroeconomics, the money supply (or money stock) refers to the total volume of money held by the public at a particular point in time.There are several ways to define \"money\", but standard measures usually include currency in circulation (i.e.physical cash) and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions).[1][2] Money supply data is recorded and published, usually by the national statistical agency or the central bank of the country.Empirical money supply measures are usually named M1, M2, M3, etc., according to how wide a definition of money they embrace.The precise definitions vary from country to country, in part depending on national financial institutional traditions..Even for narrow aggregates like M1, by far the largest part of the money supply consists of deposits in commercial banks, whereas currency (banknotes and coins) issued by central banks only makes up a small part of the total money supply in modern economies.The public's demand for currency and bank deposits and commercial banks' supply of loans are consequently important determinants of money supply changes.As these decisions are influenced by central banks' monetary policy, not least their setting of interest rates, the money supply is ultimately determined by complex interactions between non-banks, commercial banks and central banks..According to the quantity theory supported by the monetarist school of thought, there is a tight causal connection between growth in the money supply and inflation.In particular during the 1970s and 1980s this idea was influential, and several major central banks during that period attempted to control the money supply closely, following a monetary policy target of increasing the money supply stably.However, the strategy was generally found to be impractical because money demand turned out to be too unstable for the strategy to work as intended..Consequently, the money supply has lost its central role in monetary policy, and central banks today generally do not try to control the money supply.\nQ: what affects the money supply", "output": "Reasoning: There is strong

consumption) of cold beverages or foods such as ice cream, popsicles, and snow cones.It is caused by a cold substance touching the roof of the mouth, and is believed to result from a nerve response causing rapid constriction and swelling of blood vessels,[3] \"referring\" pain from the roof of the mouth to the head.[4][5] The rate of intake for cold foods has been studied as a contributing factor.[1][6] It can also occur during a sudden exposure of unprotected head to cold temperatures, such as by diving into cold water.[7] A cold-stimulus headache is distinct from dentin hypersensitivity, a type of dental pain that can occur under similar circumstances..Cats and other animals have been observed exhibiting a similar reaction when presented with a similar stimulus.[8].The term ice-cream headache has been in use since at least January 31, 1937, contained in a journal entry by Rebecca Timbres published in the 1939 book We Didn't Ask Utopia: A Quaker Family in Soviet Russia.[9][non-primary source needed] The first published use of the term brain freeze, in the sense of a cold-stimulus headache, was in 1991.[10][non-primary source needed][a] 7-Eleven has trademarked the term.[11].A cold-stimulus headache is thought to be the direct result of the rapid cooling and rewarming of the capillaries in the sinuses leading to periods of vasoconstriction and vasodilation.A similar, but painless, blood vessel response causes the face to appear \"flushed\" after being outside on a cold day.In both instances, the low temperature causes the capillaries in the sinuses to constrict and then experience extreme rebound dilation as they warm up again.[12].In the palate, this dilation is sensed by nearby pain receptors, which then send signals back to the brain via the trigeminal nerve, one of the major nerves of the facial area.This nerve also senses facial pain, so as the neural signals are conducted the brain interprets the pain as coming from the forehead\u2014the same \"referred pain\" phenomenon seen in heart attacks.Brain-freeze pain may last from a few seconds to a few minutes.Research suggests that the same vascular mechanism and nerve implicated in \"brain freeze\" cause the aura (sensory disturbance) and pulsatile (throbbing pain) phases of migraines.[13].It is possible to have a cold-stimulus headache in both hot and cold weather, because the effect relies upon the temperature of the food being consumed rather than that of the environment.\nQ: What Causes Brain Freeze", "output": "Reasoning: It is caused

\"Auld Lang Syne\" is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton (1570\u20131638), Allan Ramsay (1686\u20131757), and James Watson (1711), as well as older folk songs predating Burns.[7].In modern times, Matthew Fitt uses the phrase \"in the days of auld lang syne\" as the equivalent of \"once upon a time\" in his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language.[8].Robert Burns sent a copy of the original song to the Scots Musical Museum in 1788 with the remark, \"The following song, an old song, of the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in manuscript until I took it down from an old man.\"[9].Some of the lyrics were indeed \"collected\" rather than composed by the poet; the ballad \"Old Long Syne\" printed in 1711 by James Watson shows considerable similarity in

an elastic, springy connection between the forefoot and the hind foot so that a majority of the forces incurred during weight bearing on the foot can be dissipated before the force reaches the long bones of the leg and thigh.[1].In pes planus, the head of the talus bone is displaced medially and distal from the navicular bone.As a result, the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (spring ligament) and the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle are stretched to the extent that the individual with pes planus loses the function of the medial longitudinal arch (MLA).If the MLA is absent or nonfunctional in both the seated and standing positions, the individual has \"rigid\" flatfoot.If the MLA is present and functional while the individual is sitting or standing up on their toes, but

Silent Generation and early boomers;[4][5] Xers are also often the parents of millennials[4] and Generation Z.[6].As children in the 1970s and 1980s, a time of shifting societal values, Gen Xers were sometimes called the \"latchkey generation\", which stems from their returning as children to an empty home and needing to use the door key.This was a result of increasing divorce rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce prior to widespread availability of childcare options outside the home..As adolescents and young adults in the 1980s and 1990s, Xers were dubbed the \"MTV Generation\" (a reference to the music video channel), sometimes being characterized as slackers, cynical, and disaffected.Some of the many cultural influences on Gen X youth included a proliferation of musical genres with strong social-tribal identity such as punk, post-punk, and heavy metal, in addition to later forms developed by Gen Xers themselves (e.g., grunge, grindcore and related genres).Film, both the birth of franchise mega-sequels and a proliferation of independent film (enabled in part by video) was also a notable cultural influence.Video games both in amusement parlours and in devices in western homes were also a major part of juvenile entertainment for the first time.Politically, in many Eastern Bloc countries, Generation X experienced the last days of communism and transition to capitalism as part of its youth.In much of the western world, a similar time period was defined by a dominance of conservatism and free market economics..In midlife during the early 21st

south-eastern Peloponnese.[2] Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece..Given its military pre-eminence, Sparta was recognized as the leading force of the unified Greek military during the Greco-Persian Wars, in rivalry with the rising naval power of Athens.[3] Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BC),[4] from which it emerged victorious after the Battle of Aegospotami.The decisive Battle of Leuctra against Thebes in 371BC ended the Spartan hegemony, although the city-state maintained its political independence until its forced integration into the Achaean League in 192 BC.The city nevertheless recovered much autonomy after the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC and prospered during the Roman Empire, as its antiquarian customs attracted many Roman tourists.However, Sparta was sacked in 396AD by the Visigothic king Alaric, and underwent a long period of decline, especially in the Middle Ages, when many of its citizens moved to Mystras.Modern Sparta is the capital of the southern Greek region of Laconia and a center for processing citrus and olives..Sparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution, which were supposedly introduced by the semi-mythical legislator Lycurgus.His laws configured the Spartan society to maximize military proficiency at all costs, focusing all social institutions on military training and physical development.The inhabitants of Sparta were stratified as Spartiates (citizens with full rights), mothakes (free non-Spartiate people descended from Spartans), perioikoi (free non-Spartiates), and helots (state-owned enslaved non-Spartan locals).Spartiate men underwent the rigorous agoge training regimen, and Spartan phalanx brigades were widely considered to be among the best in battle.Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights than elsewhere in classical antiquity..\nQ: what did sparta do around 650 bc", "output":

the eyes of humans and several other animals.It occurs when using a photographic flash that is very close to the camera lens (as with most compact cameras) in ambient low light..In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close, so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil, reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil.The camera records this reflected light.The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is behind the retina.[1] The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid, and plays virtually no role.The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region, and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect.[2] The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light, below 430nm (depending on age), and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500nm, but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea.Melanin, located in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choroid, shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths.But blood is the main determinant of the red color, because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600nm.The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina.This amount varies strongly between individuals.Light-skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red-eye effect than dark-skinned people with brown eyes..The same holds for animals.\nQ: what causes photo red eye", "output": "Reasoning: It occurs when using a

independent teachers' college, UCSB joined the ancestor of the California State University system in the 1920s and then moved over to the University of California system in 1944.It is the third-oldest undergraduate campus in the system, after UC Berkeley and UCLA.Total student enrollment for 2022 was 23,460 undergraduate and 2,961 graduate students.[13].UCSB's campus is on an ocean-front, converted WWII-era Marine Corps air station.[14] UC Santa Barbara is organized into three undergraduate colleges (Letters and Science, Engineering, Creative Studies) and two graduate schools (Education and Environmental Science & Management), offering more than 200 degrees and programs.UCSB is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\" and is regarded as a Public

American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[19] The faculty also includes two Academy and Emmy Award winners and recipients of a Millennium Technology Prize, an IEEE Medal of Honor, a National Medal of Technology and Innovation and a Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics..UCSB traces its origins back to the Anna Blake School, which was founded in 1891, and offered training in home economics and industrial arts.[20][21] The Anna Blake School was taken over by the state in 1909 and became the Santa Barbara State Normal School, which then became the Santa Barbara State College in 1921.[22].In 1944, intense lobbying by an interest group in the City of Santa Barbara led by Thomas Storke and Pearl Chase persuaded the State Legislature, Gov.Earl Warren, and the Regents of the University of California to move the State College over to the more research-oriented University of California system.The State College system sued to stop the takeover, but the governor did not support the suit.A

Father's Day in some Catholic countries, mainly Spain, Portugal, and Italy.It is not a holy day of obligation for Catholics in the United States..19 March was dedicated to Saint Joseph in several Western calendars by the 10th century, and this custom was established in Rome by 1479.Pope Pius V extended its use to the entire Roman Rite by his Apostolic Constitution Quo primum (14 July 1570).Originally a double of the second class and a feast of precept, it was re-raised to be of precept in 1917 after having this status intermittently lost, and consequently also raised to its current rank of double of the first class (now called a solemnity), having become in the meantime the rank common to all remaining general feasts of precept.Since 1969, Episcopal Conferences may, if they wish, transfer it to a date outside Lent.Even if it occurs inside Lent on the usual date of 19 March, it is still observed as a Solemnity of a Saint\u2014this is one of the few times during Lent

March 1942[1] was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces: the Army Ground Forces, the United States Army Services of Supply (which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces), and the Army Air Forces.Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff..The AAF administered all parts of military aviation formerly distributed among the Air Corps, General Headquarters Air Force, and the ground forces' corps area commanders and thus became the first air organization of the U.S.Army to control its own installations and support personnel.The peak size of the AAF during World War II was over 2.4million men and women in service and nearly 80,000 aircraft by 1944, and 783 domestic bases in December 1943.[3] By \"V-E Day\", the Army Air Forces had 1.25million men stationed overseas and operated from more than 1,600 airfields worldwide.[4].The Army Air Forces was created in June 1941 to provide the air arm greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently, to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force, and to end an increasingly divisive administrative battle within the Army over control of aviation doctrine and organization that had been ongoing since the creation of an aviation section within the U.S.Army Signal Corps in 1914.The AAF succeeded both the Air Corps, which had been the statutory military aviation branch since 1926 and the GHQ Air Force, which had been activated in 1935 to quiet the demands of airmen for an independent Air Force similar to the Royal Air Force which had already been established in the United Kingdom..Although other nations already had separate air forces independent of their army or navy

disclosure procedures, and includes nine exemptions that define categories of information not subject to disclosure.[1][2] The act was intended to make U.S.government agencies' functions more transparent so that the American public could more easily identify problems in government functioning and put pressure on Congress, agency officials, and the president to address them.[3] The FOIA has

Windows 2000 was also initially planned for the business market.However, in January 2000, both projects were scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed \"Whistler\", which would serve as a single platform for both consumer and business markets.As a result, Windows XP is the first consumer edition of Windows not based on the Windows 95 kernel or MS-DOS.Windows XP removed support for PC-98, i486 and SGI Visual Workstation 320 and 540 and will only run on 32-bit x86 CPUs and devices that use BIOS firmware..Upon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim, noting increased performance and stability (especially compared to Windows Me), a more intuitive user interface, improved hardware support, and expanded multimedia capabilities.Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were succeeded by Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, released in 2007 and 2008, respectively.However, some criticisms of Windows XP were its security issues at launch, and many people believed their anti-piracy

gas..There are four main sources for the commercial production of hydrogen: natural gas, oil, coal, and electrolysis of water; which account for 48%, 30%, 18% and 4% of the world's hydrogen production respectively.[1] Fossil fuels are the dominant source of industrial hydrogen.[2] As of 2020, the majority of hydrogen (~95%) is produced by steam reforming of natural gas and other light hydrocarbons, partial oxidation of heavier hydrocarbons, and coal gasification.[3][4] Other methods of hydrogen production include biomass gasification and methane pyrolysis.Methane pyrolysis and water electrolysis can use any source of electricity including renewable energy..The production of hydrogen plays a key role in any industrialized society, since hydrogen is required for many chemical processes.[5] In 2020, roughly 87 million tons of hydrogen was produced[6] worldwide for various uses, such as oil refining, in the production of ammonia through the Haber process, and in the production of methanol through reduction of carbon monoxide.The global hydrogen generation market was valued at US$155 billion in 2022, and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.3% from 2023 to 2030.[7].Steam methane reforming (SMR) produces hydrogen from natural gas, mostly methane (CH4), and water.It is the cheapest source of industrial hydrogen, being the source of nearly 50% of the world's hydrogen.[8] The process consists of heating the gas to 700\u20131,100\u00b0C (1,300\u20132,000\u00b0F) in the presence of steam over a nickel catalyst.The resulting endothermic reaction  forms carbon monoxide and molecular hydrogen (H2).[9].In the water-gas shift reaction, the carbon monoxide reacts with steam  to obtain further quantities of H2.The WGSR also requires a catalyst, typically over iron oxide or other oxides.The byproduct is CO2.[9] Depending on the quality of the feedstock (natural gas, naphtha, etc.), one ton of hydrogen produced will also produce 9 to 12 tons of CO2, a greenhouse gas that may be captured.[10].For this process, high temperature steam (H2O) reacts with methane (CH4) in an endothermic reaction to yield syngas.[11].\nQ: how is hydrogen

waves (also known as freak waves, monster waves, episodic waves, killer waves, extreme waves, and abnormal waves) are unusually large, unpredictable, and suddenly appearing surface waves that can be extremely dangerous to ships and isolated structures such as lighthouses.[1] They are distinct from tsunamis, which are often almost unnoticeable in deep waters and are caused by the displacement of water due to other phenomena (such as earthquakes).A rogue wave at the shore is sometimes called a sneaker wave.[2].In oceanography, rogue waves are more precisely defined as waves whose height is more than twice the significant wave height (Hs or SWH), itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record.Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single exceptionally large wave.[1].Among other causes, studies of nonlinear waves such as the Peregrine soliton, and waves modeled by the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NLS), suggest that modulational instability can create an unusual sea state where a \"normal\" wave begins to draw energy from other nearby waves, and briefly becomes very large.Such phenomena are not limited to water and are also studied in liquid helium, nonlinear optics, and microwave cavities.A 2012 study reported that in addition to the Peregrine soliton reaching up to about three times the height of the surrounding sea, a hierarchy of higher order wave solutions could also exist having progressively larger sizes, and demonstrated the creation of a \"super rogue wave\" \u2014a breather around five times higher than surrounding waves\u2014 in a water-wave tank.[3].A 2012 study supported the existence of oceanic rogue holes, the inverse of rogue waves, where the depth of the hole can reach more than twice the significant wave height.Rogue holes have been replicated in experiments using water-wave tanks but have not been confirmed in the real world.[4].Rogue waves are open-water phenomena, in which winds, currents, nonlinear phenomena such as solitons, and other circumstances cause a wave to briefly form that is far larger than the \"average\" large wave (the significant wave height or \"SWH\") of that time and place.The basic underlying physics that makes phenomena such as rogue waves possible is that different waves can travel at different speeds, so they can \"pile up\" in certain circumstances, known as \"constructive interference\".(In deep ocean, the speed of a gravity wave is proportional to the square root of its wavelength, the peak-to-peak distance between adjacent waves.) However, other situations can also give rise to rogue waves, particularly situations where nonlinear effects or instability effects can cause energy to move between waves and be concentrated in one or very few extremely large waves before returning to \"normal\" conditions..\nQ: What causes rogue waves", "output": "Reasoning: Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause, but occur where

ultimate causes.Primary themes in historical analysis of the war's origins include the political takeover of Germany in 1933 by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party; Japanese militarism against China, which led to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and the Second Sino-Japanese War; Italian aggression against Ethiopia, which led to the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the consent of Western countries to

its role in World War I with heavy financial reparations and severe limitations on its military that were intended to prevent it from becoming a military power again.The demilitarisation of the Rhineland, the prohibition of German unification with Austria, the loss of its overseas colonies and of some 12% of its pre-war land area and population provoked strong currents of revanchism in

by Nazi Germany on September 1, 1939, and the subsequent declarations of war on Germany made by Britain and France, but many other prior events have been suggested as ultimate causes.Primary themes in historical analysis of the war's origins include the political takeover of Germany in 1933 by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party; Japanese militarism against China, which led to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and the Second Sino-Japanese War; Italian aggression against Ethiopia, which led to the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the consent of Western countries to Germany's actions on the annexation of Austria and the partition of Czechoslovakia and Germany's initial success in negotiating the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviet Union to divide the territorial control of Eastern Europe between them..During the interwar period, deep anger arose in the Weimar Republic on the conditions of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which punished Germany for its role in World War I with heavy financial reparations and severe limitations on its military that were intended to prevent it from becoming a military power again.The demilitarisation of the Rhineland, the prohibition of German unification with Austria, the loss of its overseas colonies and of some 12% of its pre-war land area and population provoked strong currents of revanchism in German politics..During the worldwide

"Context: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a long-term neuromuscular junction disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness.[1] The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing.[1][5] It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking.[1] Onset can be sudden.[1] Those affected often have a large thymus or develop a thymoma.[1].Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuro-muscular junction which results from antibodies that block or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the junction between the nerve and muscle.[6][7][1] This prevents nerve impulses from triggering muscle contractions.[1] Most cases are due to immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG3 antibodies that attack AChR in the postsynaptic membrane, causing complement-mediated damage and muscle weakness.[8] Rarely, an inherited genetic defect in the neuromuscular junction results in a similar condition known as congenital myasthenia.[9][10] Babies of mothers with myasthenia may have symptoms during their first few months of life, known as neonatal myasthenia.[1] Diagnosis can be supported by blood tests for specific antibodies, the edrophonium test, or a nerve conduction study.[1].MG is generally treated with medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine.[1] Immunosuppressants, such as prednisone or azathioprine, may also be used.[1] The surgical removal of the thymus may improve symptoms in certain cases.[1] Plasmapheresis and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin may be used during sudden flares of the condition.[1] If the breathing muscles become significantly weak, mechanical ventilation may be required.[1] Once intubated acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be temporarily held to reduce airway secretions.[11].MG affects 50 to 200 people per million.[3][4] It is newly diagnosed in 3 to 30 people per million each year.[12] Diagnosis has become more common due to increased awareness.[12] MG most commonly occurs in women under the age of 40 and in men over the age of 60.[1][13][14] It is uncommon in children.[1] With treatment, most of those affected lead relatively normal lives and have a normal life expectancy.[1] The word is from the Greek mys, \"muscle\" and astheneia \"weakness\", and the Latin gravis, \"serious\".[15].The initial, main symptom in MG is painless weakness of specific muscles, not fatigue.[16] The muscle weakness becomes progressively worse during periods of physical activity and improves after periods of rest.Typically, the weakness and fatigue are worse toward the end of the day.[17] MG generally starts with ocular (eye) weakness; it might then progress to a more severe generalized form, characterized by weakness in the extremities or in muscles that govern basic life functions.[18].In about two-thirds of individuals, the initial symptom of MG is related to the muscles around the eye.[16] Eyelid drooping (ptosis may occur due to weakness of m.levator palpebrae superioris)[19] and double vision (diplopia,[16] due to weakness of the extraocular muscles).[17] Eye symptoms tend to get worse when watching television, reading, or driving, particularly in bright conditions.[16] Consequently, some affected individuals choose to wear sunglasses.[16] The term \"ocular myasthenia gravis\" describes a subtype of MG where muscle weakness is confined to the eyes, i.e.extraocular muscles, m.levator palpebrae superioris, and m.orbicularis oculi.[19] Typically, this subtype evolves into generalized MG, usually after a few years.[19].The weakness of the muscles involved in swallowing may lead to swallowing difficulty (dysphagia).\nQ: how many people die from myasthenia gravis per

religion in the world, mostly because Muslims have more children than other major religious groups.[4][5] Most Muslims are either of two denominations: Sunni (87\u201390%, roughly 1.7 billion people)[6] or Shia (10\u201313%, roughly 180\u2013230 million people).[7] Islam is the majority religion in several subregions: Central Asia, Western Asia, North Africa, West Africa, the Sahel, and

most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, the most populated of the country's seven emirates.[7][8][9].Established in the 19th century as a small fishing village, Dubai grew into a regional trading hub from the early 20th century and grew rapidly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries with a focus on tourism and luxury.[10] It is second-most in five-star hotels in the world[11] and boasts the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is 828 metres (2,717ft) tall.[12].In the eastern Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf,[13] it is a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo.[14] Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub..A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate and financial services.[15][16][17][18] Oil production contributed less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in 2018.[19] The city has a population of around 3.49 million (as of 2021).[20].Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word \"Dubai\".One theory suggests the word used to be the souq in Ba.[21] An Arabic proverb says \"Daba Dubai\" (Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u0627 \u062f\u0628\u064a), meaning \"They came with a lot of money.\"[22].According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE's history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word dabba (Arabic: \u062f\u0628) (a past tense derivative of yadub (Arabic: \u064a\u062f\u0628), which means \"to creep\"), referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland..The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of \"baby locust\" (Arabic: \u062c\u0631\u0627\u062f) due to the abundance of locusts in the area before settlement.[23].The history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is rich and  complex.It points to extensive trading links between the civilisations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, and even as far afield as the Levant.[24] Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, Al Sufouh and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid[25] show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit periods, the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods and the three Iron Ages in the UAE.The area was known to the Sumerians as Magan and was a source for metallic goods, notably copper and bronze.[26].The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming part of the city's present coastline.[27] Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries.[28] Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area, the people in this region worshiped Bajir (or Bajar).[28] After the spread of Islam in the region, the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world conquered south-east Arabia and drove out the

also refers to any of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided.[10] Distinct names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic (the smallest).[11][12] Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000km2 (139,000,000sqmi) of the planet.The ocean is the primary component of the Earth's hydrosphere, and thus essential to life on Earth.The ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle by acting as a huge heat reservoir..Oceanographers split the ocean into vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions.The pelagic zone is the open ocean's water column from the surface to the ocean floor.The water column is further divided into zones based on depth and the amount of light present.The photic zone starts at the surface and is defined to be \"the depth at which light intensity is only 1% of the surface value\"[13]:\u200a36\u200a (approximately 200m in the open ocean).This is the zone where photosynthesis can occur.In this process plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) use light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients to produce organic matter.As a result, the photic zone is the most biodiverse and the source of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem.Ocean photosynthesis also produces half of the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere.[14] Light can only penetrate a few hundred more meters; the rest of the deeper ocean is cold and dark (these zones are called

construction of argumentation.\"[2] This definition reflects what had been implicit in their practice and what others were doing in their informal logic texts..Informal logic is associated with informal fallacies, critical thinking, the thinking skills movement[3] and the interdisciplinary inquiry known as argumentation theory.Frans H.van Eemeren writes that the label \"informal logic\"

domesticus), often called swine (pl.: swine), hog, or domestic pig when distinguishing from other members of the genus Sus, is an omnivorous, domesticated, even-toed, hoofed mammal.It is variously considered a subspecies of Sus scrofa (the wild boar or Eurasian boar) or a distinct species.The pig's head-plus-body length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8m (3 to 6ft), and adult pigs typically weigh between 50 and 350kg (110 and 770lb), with well-fed individuals even exceeding this range.The size and weight of hogs largely depends on their breed.Compared to other artiodactyls, a pig's head is relatively long and pointed.Most even-toed ungulates are herbivorous, but pigs are omnivores, like their wild relative.Pigs grunt and make snorting sounds..When used as livestock, pigs are farmed primarily for the production of meat, called pork.A group of pigs is called a passel, a team, or a sounder.The animal's bones, hide, and bristles are also used in products.Pigs, especially miniature breeds, are kept as pets..The pig typically has a large head, with a long snout which is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and a disk of cartilage at the tip.[2] The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food and is a very acute sense organ.\nQ: what do pigs eat", "output": "Reasoning: Pigs are omnivores and are highly social and intelligent animals."}, {"input": "Context: In baseball, a cut fastball or cutter is a type of fastball that breaks toward the pitcher's glove-hand side, as it reaches home plate.[1] This pitch is somewhere between a slider and a four-seam fastball, as it is usually thrown faster than a slider but with more movement than a typical fastball.[1] Some pitchers use a cutter to prevent hitters from expecting their regular fastballs.A common technique for throwing a cutter is to use a four-seam fastball grip with the baseball set slightly off center in the hand.[2] A batter hitting a cutter pitch often achieves only soft contact and an easy out due to the pitch's movement keeping the ball away from the bat's sweet spot.The cutter is typically 2\u20135mph slower than a pitcher's four-seam fastball.In 2010, the average pitch classified as a cutter by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6mph; the average two-seamer was 90.97mph.[3].The New York Yankees' former closer Mariano Rivera, one of the foremost practitioners of the cutter,[1] made the pitch famous after the mid-1990s, though the pitch itself has been around since at least the 1950s.[4].When the cut fastball is pitched skillfully at speed, particularly against the opposite hand batter (that is, a right-handed pitcher facing a left-handed hitter), the pitch can crack and split a hitter's bat, hence the pitch's occasional nickname of \"the buzzsaw\".Batter Ryan Klesko, then of the Atlanta Braves, broke three bats in a single plate appearance during the 1999 World Series while facing Rivera.To deal with this problem a few switch hitters batted right-handed against the right-handed Rivera\u2014that is, on the \"wrong\" side, as switch hitters generally bat from the same side of the plate as the pitcher's glove hand.[5].In 2011, Dan Haren led all major league starting pitchers with nearly 48% of his pitches classified by PITCHf/x as cutters.Roy Halladay was close behind at 45%.[6] Other pitchers who rely (or relied) heavily on a cut fastball include Jon Lester, James Shields, Josh Tomlin, Will Harris, Mark Melancon, Jaime Garcia, Wade Miley, David Robertson, Jerry Reuss, Andy Pettitte, and Corbin Burnes.[7][8][9] Over the course of Kenley Jansen's career from (2010\u2013present)[10] he has thrown his cutter 85.1% of the time, second only to Rivera at 87.2% among pitchers with at least 30 innings during that time period.[11].The cutter grew in popularity as certain pitchers, including  Dan Haren, looked to compensate for loss of speed in their four-seam fastball.[1] Braves third baseman Chipper Jones attributed the increased dominance of pitchers from 2010\u20132011 to a more prolific use of the cutter, as did Cleveland Indians pitcher Chris Perez.[12][13] By 2011, it was commonly being called the \"pitch du jour\" in the baseball press.[7][14].Some pushback has developed against (overuse of) the pitch, due to concerns that a pitcher overusing the cutter could develop arm fatigue.[15] Baltimore Orioles General Manager Dan Duquette instructed prized prospect Dylan Bundy not to throw the pitch in the minor leagues, believing its use could make Bundy's fastball and curve less effective.[16].\nQ: what does a cutter do",

easier to transport coal to the surrounding communities and to Denver, helping the town grow quickly.[11] Although the locals were mining coal in the surrounding area starting in the 1860s, the first official mine in Erie opened in 1876; operated by Ira Austin.[10].The first school was established in 1874, with 33 students enrolling.[9] The first school building was erected in 1881, with 100

Schizophrenia is a mental disorder[14] characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis.[5] Major symptoms include hallucinations (typically hearing voices), delusions and disorganized thinking.[7] Other symptoms include social withdrawal and flat affect.[5] Symptoms typically develop gradually, begin during young adulthood, and in many cases are never resolved.[3][7] There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a psychiatric history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.[7] For a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the described symptoms need to have been present for at least six months (according to the DSM-5) or one month (according to the ICD-11).[7][15] Many people with schizophrenia have other mental disorders, especially substance use disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder.[7].About 0.3% to 0.7% of people are diagnosed with schizophrenia during their lifetime.[16] In 2017, there were an estimated 1.1million new cases and in 2022 a total of 24 million cases globally.[2][17] Males are more often affected and on average have an earlier onset than females.[2] The causes of schizophrenia may include genetic and environmental factors.[5] Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants.[18] Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, childhood adversity, cannabis use during adolescence, infections, the age of a person's mother or father, and poor nutrition during pregnancy.[5][19].About half of those diagnosed with schizophrenia will have a significant improvement over the long term with no further relapses, and a small proportion of these will recover completely.[7][20] The other half will have a lifelong impairment.[21] In severe cases, people may be admitted to hospitals.[20] Social problems such as long-term unemployment, poverty, homelessness, exploitation and victimization are commonly correlated with schizophrenia.[22][23] Compared to the general population, people with schizophrenia have a higher suicide rate (about 5% overall) and more physical health problems,[24][25] leading to an average decrease in life expectancy by 20[10] to 28 years.[11] In 2015, an estimated 17,000 deaths were linked to schizophrenia.[13].The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counseling, job training and social rehabilitation.[5] Up to a third of people do not respond to initial antipsychotics, in which case clozapine may be used.[26] In a network comparative meta-analysis of 15 antipsychotic drugs, clozapine was significantly more effective than all other drugs, although clozapine's heavily multimodal action may cause more side effects.[27] In situations where doctors judge that there is a risk of harm to self or others, they may impose short involuntary hospitalization.[28] Long-term hospitalization is used on a small number of people with severe schizophrenia.[29] In some countries where supportive services are limited or unavailable, long-term hospital stays are more common.[30].Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood and behavior.[31] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms.[3][32] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms.These may be present in any of the different psychoses and are often transient, making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic.Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[33][34].Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia.They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[33] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[35] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices), but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell and touch.[36] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[35] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[37] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature.Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as others can hear one's thoughts to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[38] Thought disorders can include thought blocking and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps linked to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7].Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes.The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect \u2013 showing flat expressions (monotone) or little emotion; alogia \u2013 a poverty of speech; anhedonia \u2013 an inability to feel pleasure; asociality \u2013 the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition \u2013 a lack of motivation and apathy.[39][40] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational

multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[39][43] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[44] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[45].\nQ: how is schizophrenia diagnosed?", "output": "Reasoning:

residents of Scandinavian heritage are still a majority.In 1870, Leon (Chadwick) Willmar, a Belgian acting as an agent for the European bondholder of the St.Paul and Pacific Railroad, purchased the title to Section 1 of Willmar Township.[9] Willmar was established as the county seat in 1871 and was incorporated as a village in 1874 and as a city in 1901.[10].Willmar was the site of a bank robbery by the Machine Gun Kelly gang on July 15, 1930.They robbed the Bank of Willmar (later Bremer Bank) of about $70,000 (equivalent to $1,226,000 in 2022) and wounded three people.[11].The Willmar Memorial Auditorium, designed by architect William Ingemann, was the largest assembly hall within 70 miles when completed in 1938.It was funded by the city of Willmar and state and federal governments as a Depression-era works project.It contains several murals by Richard Haines commissioned by the Federal Art Project, and wood paneling in the oak doors by WPA artists.[8] It is on the National Register of Historic Places.[12].\nQ: what county is willmar mn in?", "output": "Reasoning: Willmar is a city in, and the county seat of, Kandiyohi County , Minnesota , United States ."}, {"input": "Context: Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.[1] On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's atmosphere, the troposphere,[2][3] just below the stratosphere.Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[4] When used without qualification, \"weather\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth..Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another.These differences can occur due to the Sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude.The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream.Weather systems in the middle latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow.Because Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year.On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range \u00b140\u00b0C (\u221240\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F) annually.Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change..Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant.Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location.\nQ: how does weather happen", "output": "Reasoning: Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another."}, {"input": "Context: The following is a list of countries and territories where English is an official language\u2014that is, a language used in citizen interactions with government officials.As of 2020[update], there were 58 sovereign states and 28 non-sovereign entities where English was an official language.[citation needed] Many administrative divisions have declared English an official language at the local or regional level..Most states where English is an official language are former territories of the British Empire.Exceptions include Rwanda and Burundi, which were formerly German and then Belgian colonies;

plants to be dormant.Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations, and as such there are a number of both modern and historical cultures whose number of seasons varies..The Northern Hemisphere experiences most direct sunlight during May, June, and July, as the hemisphere faces the Sun.The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January.It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux.However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere..In temperate and sub-polar regions, four seasons based on the Gregorian calendar are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn (or fall), and winter.Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions which are not tied to any fixed calendar dates: prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, autumnal, and hibernal.Many tropical regions have two seasons: the rainy, wet, or monsoon season and the dry season.Some have a third cool, mild, or

event..The word mazel comes from the Biblical Hebrew mazz\u0101l, meaning \"constellation\" or (in Mishnaic Hebrew) \"astrological sign\" and may be related to the root \u05e0-\u05d6-\u05dc meaning \"to flow down\".The phrase mazel tov first appears in Geonic Hebrew, where it means \"positive astrological sign\"  or simply \"good fortune.\"[1] The Medieval Hebrew chant siman tov u-mazel tov, yehe lanu ulkhol yisrael \"A good sign, a good omen! Let it happen for us and for all Israel\" was used to congratulate, and the phrase itself acquired a congratulatory usage in Yiddish and Hebrew by the early 19th century and was later incorporated

lucky\").[4] The word tov also entered Dutch as tof or toffe (\"nice\" or \"great\")[5] and German as t\u00f6fte or dufte.[6].Mazel tov is literally translated as \"good luck\" in its meaning as a description, not a wish.The implicit meaning is \"good luck has occurred\" or \"your fortune has been good\" and the expression is an acknowledgement of that fact.It is similar in usage to the word \"congratulations!\" and conveys roughly, \"I am pleased this good thing has happened to you!\"[citation needed] A common Hebrew phrase for wishing \"good luck\" is b'hatzlacha

the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver;[2] it is a type of viral hepatitis.[6] During the initial infection period, people often have mild or no symptoms.[1] Early symptoms can include fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin.[1] The virus persists in the liver, becoming chronic, in about 70% of those initially infected.[4] Early on, chronic infection typically has no symptoms.[1] Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis.[1] In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop serious complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach.[2].HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with injection drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions.[1][3] In regions where blood screening has been implemented, the risk of contracting HCV from a transfusion has dropped substantially to less than one per two million.[1] HCV may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth.[1] It is not spread through breast milk, food, water or casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.[4] It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.[7].Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or viral RNA.[1] In the United States, screening for HCV infection is recommended in all adults age 18 to 79 years old.[8].There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.[1][9] Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who inject drugs, testing donated blood, and treatment of people with chronic infection.[4][10] Chronic infection can be cured more than 95% of the time with antiviral medications such as sofosbuvir or simeprevir.[1][4] Peginterferon and ribavirin were earlier generation treatments that proved successful in <50% of cases and caused greater side effects.[4]:\u200a2015 version\u200a[11] While access to the newer treatments was expensive,  by 2022 prices had dropped dramatically in many countries (primarily low-income and lower-middle-income countries) due to the introduction of generic versions of  medicines.[4] Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant.[5] Hepatitis C is one of the leading reasons for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation.[5].An estimated 58 million people worldwide were infected with hepatitis C in 2019.Approximately 290,000 deaths from the virus, mainly from liver cancer and cirrhosis attributed to hepatitis C, also occurred in 2019.[12] The existence of hepatitis C \u2013 originally identifiable only as a type of non-A non-B hepatitis \u2013 was suggested in the 1970s and proven in 1989.[13] Hepatitis C infects only humans and chimpanzees.[14].Acute symptoms develop in some 20% of those infected.[4][1] When this occurs, it is generally 4\u201312 weeks following infection (but it may take from 2 weeks to 6 months for acute symptoms to appear).[1][4].Symptoms are generally mild and vague, and may include fatigue, nausea and vomiting, fever, muscle or joint pains, abdominal pain, decreased appetite and weight loss, jaundice (occurs in ~25% of those infected), dark urine, and clay-coloured stools.[1][15][16] Acute liver failure due to acute hepatitis C is exceedingly rare.[17] Symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of liver disease should prompt further tests and can thus help establish a diagnosis of hepatitis C infection early on.[16].Following the acute phase, the infection may resolve spontaneously in 10\u201350% of affected people; this occurs more frequently in young people and females.[15].About 70% of those exposed to the virus develop a chronic infection.[4] This is defined as the presence of detectable viral replication for at least six months.Though most experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few decades of a chronic infection,[18] chronic hepatitis C can be associated with fatigue[19] and mild cognitive problems.[20] After several years, chronic infection may cause cirrhosis or liver cancer.[5] The liver enzymes measured from blood samples are normal in 7\u201353%.[21] (Elevated levels indicate liver cells are being damaged by the virus or other disease).Late relapses after apparent cure have been reported, but these can be difficult to distinguish from reinfection.[21].\nQ: How Do You Get Hepatitis C", "output": "Reasoning: HCV is spread primarily by

medical and dependent care expenses.A few cafeteria plans offer other types of FSAs, especially if the employer also offers an HSA.Participation in one type of FSA does not affect participation in another type of FSA, but funds cannot be transferred from one FSA to another.[3].The most common type of FSA is used to pay for medical and dental expenses not paid for by insurance, usually deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance for the employee's health plan..As of January 1, 2011, over-the-counter medications are allowed only when purchased with a doctor's prescription, except for insulin.[4] Over-the-counter medical devices, such as bandages, crutches, and eyeglass repair kits, are allowable.Generally, allowable items are the same as those allowable for the medical tax deduction, as outlined in IRS publication 502.[5].Prior to the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Internal Revenue Service permitted employers to enact any maximum annual election for their employees.\nQ: how does flexible spending account work", "output": "Reasoning: An FSA allows an employee to set aside a portion of earnings to pay for qualified expenses as

first constitutional government west of the Appalachian Mountains.[11] Its name derives from Tanasi (\u13d4\u13be\u13cf), a Cherokee town in the eastern part of the state that existed before the first European American settlement.[12] Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later the Southwest Territory, before its admission to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796.It earned the nickname \"The Volunteer State\" early in its history due to a strong tradition of military service.[13] A slave state until the American Civil War, Tennessee was politically divided, with its western and middle parts supporting the Confederacy and the eastern region harboring pro-Union sentiment.As a result, Tennessee was the last state to secede and the first readmitted to the Union after the war.[14].During the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from a predominantly agrarian society to a more diversified economy.This was aided in part by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the city of Oak Ridge, which was established during World War II to house the Manhattan Project's uranium enrichment facilities for the construction of the world's first

vertebrates..The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests, but due to their adaptability, they have extended their range to mountainous areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas,

end-time event when all dead Christian believers will be resurrected and, joined with Christians who are still alive, together will rise \"in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.\"[1] The origin of the term extends from the First Epistle to the Thessalonians in the Bible, which uses the Greek word harpazo (Ancient Greek: \u1f01\u03c1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9), meaning \"to snatch away\" or \"to seize\".This view of eschatology is referred to as dispensational premillennialism, a form of futurism that considers various prophecies in the Bible as remaining unfulfilled and occurring in the future..The idea of a rapture as it is currently defined is not found in historic Christianity, and is a relatively recent doctrine originating from the 1830s.The term is used frequently among fundamentalist theologians in the United States.[2] Rapture has also been used for a mystical union with God or for eternal life in Heaven.[2].Differing viewpoints exist about the exact timing of the rapture and whether Christ's return would occur in one event or two.Pretribulationism distinguishes the rapture from the second coming of Jesus Christ mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew, 2 Thessalonians, and Revelation.This view holds that the rapture would precede the seven-year Tribulation, which would culminate in Christ's second coming and be followed by a thousand-year Messianic Kingdom.[3][4] This theory grew out of the translations of the Bible that John Nelson Darby analyzed in 1833.Pretribulationism is the most widely held view among Christians believing in the rapture today, although this view is disputed within evangelicalism.[5] Some assert a post-tribulational rapture..Most Christian denominations do not subscribe to rapture theology and have a different interpretation of the aerial gathering described in 1 Thessalonians 4.[6] They do not use rapture as a specific theological term, nor do they generally subscribe to the premillennial dispensational views associated with its use.[7] Instead they typically interpret rapture in the sense of the elect gathering with Christ in Heaven right after his second coming and reject the idea that a large segment of humanity will be left behind on earth for an extended tribulation period after the events of 1 Thessalonians 4:17.[6][8].Rapture is derived from Middle French rapture, via the Medieval Latin raptura (\"seizure, kidnapping\"), which derives from the Latin raptus (\"a carrying off\").[9].The Koine Greek of 1 Thessalonians 4:17 uses the verb form \u1f01\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 (harpag\u0113sometha), which means \"we shall be caught up\" or \"we shall be taken away\".The dictionary form of this Greek verb is harpaz\u014d (\u1f01\u03c1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9).[10] This use is also seen in such texts as Acts 8:39,[11] 2 Corinthians 12:2\u20134,[12] and Revelation 12:5.[13] Linguist, Dr.\nQ: What

summary of the financial balances of an individual or organization, whether it be a sole proprietorship, a business partnership, a corporation, private limited company or other organization such as government or not-for-profit entity.Assets, liabilities and ownership equity are listed as of a specific date, such as the end of its financial year.A balance sheet is often described as a \"snapshot of a company's financial condition\".[1]  It is the summary of each and every financial statement of an organization..Of the four basic financial statements, the balance sheet is the only statement which applies to a single point in time of a business's calendar year..A standard company balance sheet has two sides: assets on the left, and financing on the right\u2013which itself has two parts; liabilities and ownership equity.The main categories of assets are usually listed first, and typically in order of liquidity.[2] Assets are followed by the liabilities.The difference between the assets and the liabilities is known as equity or the net assets or the net worth or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation, net worth must equal assets minus liabilities.[3].Another way to look at the balance sheet equation is that total assets equals liabilities plus owner's equity.Looking at the equation in this way shows how assets were financed: either by borrowing money (liability) or by using the owner's money (owner's or shareholders' equity).Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections \"balancing\"..A business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period, plus any cash in

Hornady[3] in 2002.It was developed  by necking down a .22 Magnum case to take a  .17 caliber (4.5mm) projectile.Commonly loaded with a 17 grain (1.1 g) projectile, it can deliver muzzle velocities in excess of 775m/s (2,650ft/s).[4].The .17 HMR round is similar to rounds developed by dedicated rimfire wildcatters who worked to create a rimfire cartridge with an exceptionally flat trajectory.These wildcatters were seeking to match the ballistics of the obsolete 5mm Remington Rimfire Magnum, which was made from 1970 to 1974, and was to that point the fastest rimfire cartridge ever produced.[5]  With 5 mm diameter barrels and bullets being virtually unavailable at the time (the 5mm RMR was the last commercial 5 mm round until the 2004 release of the centerfire .204 Ruger), the commercially available .17 caliber became their bullet of choice.The .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire  was the logical parent case, rather than the 5mm RMR (with its unique case head size, which requires a significantly different bolt and magazine) because it was commonly available, and it is a far larger and stronger case than the next largest, the .22 Long Rifle.The .17 caliber wildcats not only met but far exceeded the 5mm RMR's velocities and flat trajectory.The accuracy of these cartridges was also quite good.However, the downrange energy of the 5mm RMR is superior to both .22 WMR and .17 HMR, so there is still potential in the 5 mm rimfire for wildcatters.[6].Hornady, in conjunction with Marlin Firearms and Sturm, Ruger & Co.(manufacturers in the rimfire rifle market), followed much the same path.With the .22 WMR case as the starting point, a simple barrel change was sufficient for most .22 WMR firearms to chamber the new cartridge.\nQ: what is .17 hmr caliber", "output": "Reasoning:

assassination in 44 BC.He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire..In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, an informal political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years.Their attempts to amass political power were opposed by many in the Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the private support of Cicero.Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a string of military victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51BC, which greatly extended Roman territory.During this time he both invaded Britain and built a bridge across the river Rhine.These achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to eclipse the

a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport..Modern cross-country skiing is similar to the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and Telemark skiing.Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow.It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including Europe, Canada, Russia, the United States, Australia[1] and New Zealand.[2].Competitive cross-country skiing is one of the Nordic skiing sports.Cross-country skiing and rifle marksmanship are the two components of biathlon.Ski orienteering is

Bloc.The term cold war is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported opposing sides in major regional conflicts known as proxy wars.The conflict was based on the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their roles as the Allies of World War II that led to victory against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945.[2] Aside from the nuclear arms race and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means, such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, sports diplomacy, and technological competitions like the Space Race.The Cold War began shortly after the end of World War II, started a gradual winding down with the Sino-Soviet split between the Soviets and the People's Republic of China in 1961, and ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991..The Western Bloc was led by the United States, as well as a number of other First World nations that were generally liberal democratic but tied to a network of often authoritarian, Third World states, most of which were the European powers' former colonies.[3][B] The Eastern Bloc was led by the Soviet Union and its Communist Party, which had an influence across the Second World and was also tied to a network of authoritarian states.The Soviet Union had a command economy and installed similarly Communist regimes in its satellite states.United States involvement in regime change during the Cold War included support for anti-communist and right-wing dictatorships, governments, and uprisings across the world, while Soviet involvement in regime change included the funding left-wing parties, wars of national liberation and revolutions around the world.As nearly all the colonial states underwent decolonization and achieved independence in the period from 1945 to 1960, many became Third World battlefields in the Cold War..The first phase of the Cold War began shortly after the end of World War II in 1945.The United States and its Western European allies sought to strengthen their bonds and used the policy of containment against Soviet influence; they accomplished this most notably through the formation of NATO, which was essentially a defensive agreement in 1949.The Soviet Union countered with the Warsaw Pact in 1955, which had similar results with the Eastern Bloc.As by that time the Soviet Union already had an armed presence and political domination all over its eastern satellite states, the pact has been long considered superfluous.[4][5] Although nominally a defensive alliance, the Warsaw Pact's primary function was to safeguard Soviet hegemony over its Eastern European satellites, with the pact's only direct military actions having been the invasions of its own member states to keep them from breaking away;[6] in the 1960s, the pact evolved into a multilateral alliance, in which the non-Soviet Warsaw Pact members gained significant scope to pursue their own interests.\nQ: when did the cold war start", "output": "Reasoning: The Cold War, often dated from 1947 to 1991,

of the text rather than the exact words in a text, and it differs from a table of contents because the index is ordered by subject, regardless of whether it is early or late in the book, while the listed items in a table of contents is placed in the same order as the book.[1].In a traditional back-of-the-book index, the headings will include names of people, places, events, and concepts selected as being relevant and of interest to a possible reader of the book.The indexer performing the selection may be the author, the editor, or a professional indexer working as a third party.The pointers are typically page numbers, paragraph numbers or section numbers..In a library catalog the words are authors, titles, subject headings, etc., and the pointers are call numbers.Internet search engines (such as Google) and full-text searching help provide access to information but are not as selective as an index, as they provide non-relevant links, and may miss relevant information if it is not phrased in exactly the way they expect.[2].Perhaps the most advanced investigation of problems related to book indexes is made in the development of topic maps, which started as a way of

a) does not make sense to the financial institution; b) is unusual for that particular client; or c) appears to be done only for the purpose of hiding or obfuscating another, separate transaction.The report is filed with that country's financial crime enforcement agency, which is typically a specialist agency designed to collect and analyse transactions and then report these to relevant law enforcement teams..Front line staff in the financial institution have the responsibility to identify transactions that may be suspicious and these are reported to a designated person that is responsible for reporting the suspicious transaction.This means that the front line staff can ask questions and in some cases refuse the transaction.However the financial institution is not allowed to inform the client or parties involved in the transaction that a SAR has been lodged, otherwise known as tipping off under the Financial Action Task Force's Recommendations.[1].The Financial Action Task Force's Recommendations are widely recognized as the international standard in anti-money laundering and countering financing terrorism with endorsements from 180 nations.[2] FATF Recommendations set forth essential measures to combat money laundering and to protect domestic and international monetary systems including the application of preventive measures for the financial sector and other designated sectors; and establishment of powers and responsibilities for the relevant competent authorities (e.g., investigative, law enforcement and supervisory authorities), including guidelines regarding suspicious activity reports.[3].Most countries have laws that require financial institutions to report suspicious transactions and will have a designated agency to receive them.The agency to which a report is required to be filed for a given country is typically part of the law enforcement or financial regulatory department of that country.For example, in the United States, suspicious transaction reports[4] must be reported to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an agency of the United States Department of the Treasury.In Australia the Suspicious Matter Report must be reported to Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), an Australian government agency.A 2020 Bank Policy Institute study found that American SARs elicited a response from law

sulfonamides are also devoid of antibacterial activity, e.g., the anticonvulsant sultiame.The sulfonylureas and thiazide diuretics are newer drug groups based upon the antibacterial sulfonamides.[1][2].Allergies to sulfonamides are common.The overall incidence of adverse drug reactions to sulfa antibiotics is approximately 3%, close to penicillin;[3] hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully..Sulfonamide drugs were the first broadly effective antibacterials to be used systemically, and paved the way for the antibiotic revolution in medicine..In

Piers..The New York Passenger Ship Terminal originally consisted of Piers 84, 86, 88, 90, 92 and 94, located on the Hudson River between West 44th and West 54th Street.[4] They were first designed to replace the Chelsea Piers as the city's luxury liner terminal and accommodate bigger ships that had outgrown the Chelsea Piers..The two southernmost piers, each 1,000 feet long, were initially constructed in the 1920s to keep up with the growth in maritime traffic.[5] By the 1930s, however, even larger facilities were needed, leading to the construction between 1935 and 1937 of Piers 88\u201392, each 1,100 feet (340 m) long and 400 feet (120 m) apart..The plan was to lengthen a number of existing 800-foot piers, but the US Army Corps of Engineers, who controlled the waterfront dimension, would not allow the extension of the pierhead line farther into the river, so the city was forced to extend the pier by cutting away at the land.The city had previously done this for the Chelsea Piers, however in Chelsea only landfill was removed.At the Passenger Terminal, actual Manhattan schist was taken away.[6] The results of this can also be seen in the West Side Highway's diversion eastward from West 57th to 42nd Street..By the 1960s, the old facilities had deteriorated and lacked the amenities of modern cruise terminals.[7] After years of planning, a new terminal was

right, are Christian political factions which are characterized by their strong support of socially conservative and traditionalist policies.[1] Christian conservatives seek to influence politics and public policy with their interpretation of the teachings of Christianity.[2][3][4].In the United States, the Christian right is an informal coalition which was formed around a core of predominantly White conservative Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics.[2][5][6][7] The Christian right draws additional support from politically conservative mainline Protestants and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[5][8] The movement has its roots in American politics going back as far as the 1940s; it has been especially influential since the 1970s.[1][9][10][11][12] Its influence draws from grassroots activism as well as from focus on social issues and the ability to motivate the electorate around those issues.[13].The Christian right is notable because it has advanced socially conservative positions on issues such as creationism in public education,[14] school prayer,[15] temperance,[16] Christian nationalism,[17] and Sunday Sabbatarianism,[18] as well as opposition to biological evolution,[14] embryonic stem cell research,[19] LGBT rights,[3][9][15][20] comprehensive sex education,[21][22] abortion,[15][23] and pornography.[24] Although the term Christian right is most commonly associated with politics in the United States, similar Christian conservative groups can be found in the political cultures of other Christian-majority countries..The Christian right is \"also known as the New Christian Right (NCR) or the Religious Right\", although some consider the religious right to be \"a slightly broader category than Christian Right\".[10][25].John C.Green of the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life states that Jerry Falwell used the label religious right to describe himself.Gary Schneeberger, vice president of media and public relations for Focus on the Family, states that \"[t]erms like 'religious right' have been traditionally used in a pejorative way to suggest extremism.The phrase 'socially conservative evangelicals' is not very exciting, but that's certainly the way to do it.\"[26].Evangelical leaders like Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council have called attention to the problem of equating the term Christian right with evangelicals.Although evangelicals constitute the core constituency of the Christian right, not all evangelicals fit the description, and a number of Roman Catholics are also members of the Christian right's core base.[5] The problem of description is further complicated by the fact that the label religious conservative or conservative Christian may apply to other religious groups as well.For instance, Anabaptist Christians (most notably Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, the Bruderhof Communities, Schwarzenau Brethren, River Brethren and Apostolic Christians) are theologically, socially, and culturally conservative; however, there are no overtly political organizations associated with these Christian denominations, which are usually uninvolved, uninterested, apathetic, or indifferent towards politics.[27] Tim Keller, an Evangelical theologian and Presbyterian Church in America pastor, shows that Conservative Christianity (theology) predates the Christian right (politics), and that being a theological conservative didn't necessitate being a political conservative, that some political progressive views around economics, helping the poor, the redistribution of wealth, and racial diversity are compatible with theologically conservative Christianity.[28] Rod Dreher, a senior editor for The American Conservative, a secular conservative magazine, also argues the same differences, even claiming that a \"traditional Christian\" a theological conservative, can simultaneously be left on economics (economic progressive) and even a socialist at that while maintaining traditional Christian beliefs.[29].In 1863, representatives from eleven Christian denominations in the United States organized the National Reform Association with

Mexico on August 26 and rapidly intensified.The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico[2] before weakening to a high-end Category 3 hurricane at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi..The largest loss of life in Hurricane Katrina was due to flooding caused by engineering flaws in the flood protection system,

tropical storm and headed generally westward toward Florida.On August 25, two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach, it strengthened into a hurricane.After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida, Katrina entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and rapidly intensified.The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico[2] before weakening to a high-end Category 3 hurricane at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi..The largest loss of life in Hurricane Katrina was due to flooding caused by engineering flaws in the flood protection system, particularly the levee[3]  around the city of New Orleans.[4] Eventually, 80% of the city, as well as large areas in neighboring parishes, were flooded for weeks.[5] The flooding destroyed most of New Orleans's transportation and communication facilities, leaving tens of thousands of people who did not evacuate the city prior to landfall with little access to food, shelter, and other basic necessities.The disaster in New Orleans prompted a massive national and international response effort, including federal, local, and private rescue operations to evacuate those displaced from the city in the following weeks.After the storm, multiple investigations concluded that the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers, which had designed and built the region's levees decades earlier, was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems.[6] However, federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable due to sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928.[7].\nQ: where did hurricane katrina begin", "output": "Reasoning: Hurricane Katrina formed over the Bahamas on August 23, 2005 and crossed

attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads directly to a score by field goal, meaning that they were \"assisting\" in the basket.An assist is also credited when a basket is awarded due to defensive goaltending..There is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assist.An assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ball for a short distance.However, the original definition of an assist did not include such situations,[1] so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matter..Only the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist, so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal (unlike in other sports, such as ice hockey).A pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the NBA, but does in FIBA play (only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is made)..Point guards tend to get the most assists per game (apg), as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler..Centers tend to get fewer assists, but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assisting.Being inside the key, the center often has the best angles and the best position for \"dishes\" and other short passes in the scoring area.Current NBA Center Nikola Joki\u0107 is among the league leaders in assists and play-making.Center Wilt Chamberlain led the NBA in total assists in 1968.\nQ: what is an assist in

countries as one-thousandth of the base unit.In the United States, it is a notional unit equivalent to a thousandth of a United States dollar (a hundredth of a dime or a tenth of a cent).In the United Kingdom, it was proposed during the decades of discussion on decimalisation as a 1\u20441000 division of sterling's pound.While this system was never adopted in the United Kingdom, the currencies of some British or formerly British territories did adopt it, such as the Palestine pound and the Maltese lira..The term comes from the Latin \"millesimum\", meaning \"thousandth part\".[1].In the United States, the term was first used by the Continental Congress in 1786, being described as the \"lowest money of account, of which 1000 shall be equal to the federal dollar\".[2].The Coinage Act of 1792 describes milles and other subdivisions of the dollar:.That the money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars or units, dismes or tenths, cents or hundredths, and milles or thousandths, a disme being the tenth part of a dollar, a cent the hundredth part of a dollar, a mille the thousandth part of a dollar, and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation.[3].The mint of Philadelphia made half cents worth 5 mills each from 1793 to 1857..Tokens in this denomination were issued by some states and local governments (and by some private interests) for such uses as payment of sales tax.[4] These were of inexpensive material such as tin, aluminium, plastic or

bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich (BLT)), or as a flavouring or accent (as in bacon bits in a salad)..Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant, and may also be used to insulate or flavour roast joints by being layered onto the meat.The word is derived from the Proto-Germanic *bakkon, meaning \"back meat\".[2].Meat from other animals, such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or turkey, may also be cut, cured, or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon, and may even be referred to as, for example, \"turkey bacon\".[3] Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations as both religions prohibit the consumption of pork.[4] Vegetarian bacons such as \"soy bacon\" also exist..Before the advent of cheap and widespread artificial refrigeration in the modern era, the curing of meat was necessary for its safe long-term preservation.However, both the flavour imparted to the meat in doing so and the extended shelf life it offered had become much prized, and although curing is in general no longer necessary in the developed world, it continues in wide use..Bacon is cured through either a process of injecting it with or soaking it in brine, known as wet curing, or rubbed with salt, known as dry curing.[1][5] Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably nitrites or nitrates, which speed the curing and stabilize colour.Cured bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, or it may be smoked or boiled.[1] Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying.Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating.Differing flavours can be achieved by using various types of wood, or less common fuels such as corn cobs or peat.This process can take up to eighteen hours, depending on the intensity of the flavour desired.\nQ: what part of the pig is bacon", "output": "Reasoning: It is usually made from

was at 12.2 million and 4% of the total U.S.population.[4][5] Estimates in 2016 put the number of unauthorized immigrants at 10.7 million, representing 3.3% of the total U.S.population.[4] Since the Great Recession, more illegal immigrants have left the United States than entered it, and illegal border crossings were at the lowest in decades until 2021, when a record of 1.7 million people were caught trying to cross the southern border illegally.[6][7][8][9][10] Since 2007, visa overstays have accounted for a larger share of the growth in the illegal immigrant population than illegal border crossings,[11] which have declined considerably from 2000 to 2018.[12] In 2012, 52% of unauthorized immigrants were from Mexico, 15% from Central America, 12% from Asia, 6% from South America, 5% from the Caribbean, and another 5% from Europe and Canada.[13] As of 2016, approximately two-thirds of unauthorized adult immigrants had lived in the U.S.for at least a decade.[4].Opponents of illegal immigration argue that people who enter the United States illegally are criminals, as well as social and economic burdens on law-abiding natives.Opponents also argue that illegal immigrants who enter the United States illegally should be deported instead of being awarded with U.S.citizenship and social services.[14] Some argue that illegal immigrants should instead enter the United States lawfully through legal immigration.[15][16].Research shows that illegal immigrants increase the size of the U.S.economy, contribute to economic growth, enhance the welfare of natives, contribute more in tax revenue than they collect, reduce American firms' incentives to offshore jobs and import foreign-produced goods, and benefit consumers by reducing the prices of goods and services.[17][18][19][20] Economists estimate that legalization of the illegal immigrant population would increase the immigrants' earnings and consumption considerably, and increase U.S.gross domestic product.[21][22][23][24] There is scholarly consensus that illegal immigrants commit less crime than natives.[25][26] Sanctuary cities\u2014which adopt policies designed to avoid prosecuting people solely for being in the

Great Britain and Ireland, keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and Muggles..About 300 years after the school was founded, the Triwizard Tournament was established as an interscholastic competition among the three most prestigious magical schools in Europe: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang.The tournament continued for six centuries before being discontinued.An

2007\u20132008 global financial crisis.[1][2] The crisis led to a severe economic recession, with millions of people losing their jobs and many businesses going bankrupt.The U.S.government intervened with a series of measures to stabilize the financial system, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)..It was triggered by a large decline in US home prices after the collapse of a housing bubble, leading to mortgage delinquencies, foreclosures, and the devaluation of housing-related securities.Declines in residential investment preceded the Great Recession and were followed by reductions in household spending and then business investment.Spending reductions were more significant in areas with a combination of high household debt and larger housing price declines.[3].The housing bubble preceding the crisis was financed with mortgage-backed securities (MBSes) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which initially offered higher interest rates (i.e.better returns) than government securities, along with attractive risk ratings from rating agencies.While elements of the crisis first became more visible during 2007, several major financial institutions collapsed in September 2008, with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession.[4].There were many causes of the crisis, with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions, regulators, credit agencies, government housing policies, and consumers, among others.[5] Two proximate causes were the rise in subprime lending and the increase in housing speculation.The percentage of lower-quality subprime mortgages originated during a given year rose from the historical 8% or lower range to approximately 20% from 2004 to 2006, with much higher ratios in some parts of the U.S.[6][7] A high percentage of these subprime mortgages, over 90% in 2006 for example, had an interest rate that increased over time.[4] Housing speculation also increased, with the share of mortgage originations to investors (i.e.those owning homes other than primary residences) rising significantly from around 20% in 2000 to around 35% in 2006\u20132007.\nQ: when us subprime mortgage market collapse", "output": "Reasoning: The U.S. subprime mortgage

system.It involves money earned by an employee being placed into an investment fund to be made legally available to fund members upon retirement..Under the Australian superannuation system, employers make compulsory payments to these funds at a proportion of their employee's wages.As of July 2023[update], the mandatory minimum contribution is 11%.[1] This percentage figure is referred to as the \"superannuation guarantee\"..The superannuation guarantee was introduced by the Hawke government to promote self-funded retirement savings, reducing reliance on a publicly funded pension system.[2] Legislation to support the introduction of the superannuation guarantee was passed by the Keating Government in 1992.[2].Contributions to superannuation accounts are subject to a concessional income tax rate of 15%.This means that for most Australians, the tax on their money sent to a superannuation account is less than the tax on money sent to their bank account..Australians can contribute additional superannuation beyond the 11% minimum, subject to limits.The maximum amount that may be contributed per year is $27,500.[3] Contributions higher than this are taxed at the person's ordinary marginal tax rate, meaning there is no tax benefit for contributing beyond that amount.[4] Ultimately, superannuation is a system of mandatory saving coupled with tax concessions..As of 30March2022[update], Australians have AU$3.5 trillion invested as superannuation assets, making Australia as a nation the 4th largest holder of pension fund assets in the world.[5] The vast majority of this money is in defined contribution funds..For many years until 1976, what superannuation arrangements were in place were set up under industrial awards negotiated by the union movement or

Electoral College is the group of presidential electors required by the Constitution to form every 4 years for the sole purpose of appointing the president and vice president.Each state appoints electors under the methods described by its legislature, equal in number to its congressional delegation (representatives and senators).The federal District of Columbia also has 3 electors under an amendment adopted in 1961.Federal office holders, including senators and representatives, cannot be electors.Of the current 538 electors, a simple majority of 270 or more electoral votes is required to elect the president and vice president.If no candidate achieves a majority there, a contingent election is held by the House of Representatives to elect the president and by the Senate to elect the vice president..The states and the District of Columbia hold a statewide or districtwide popular vote on Election Day in November to choose electors based upon how they have pledged to vote for president and vice president, with some state laws prohibiting faithless electors.All states except Maine and Nebraska use a party block voting, or general ticket method, to choose their electors, meaning all their electors go to one winning ticket.Maine and Nebraska choose one elector per congressional district and 2 electors for the ticket with the highest statewide vote.The electors meet and vote in December, and the inauguration of the president and vice president take place in January..The merits of the electoral college system is a matter of ongoing debate in the United States, which came closest to switching to direct voting for president in 1969\u201370 (a transition all other democratic countries with electoral colleges for the executive head of state have made).[1] Supporters argue that it requires presidential candidates to have broad appeal across the country to win, while critics argue that it is not representative of the popular will of the nation.[a] Winner-take-all systems, especially with representation not proportional to population, does not align with the principle of \"one person, one vote\".[b][5] Critics object to the inequity that due to the distribution of electors, individual citizens in states with smaller populations have more voting power than those in larger states.[6] This is because the number of electors each state appoints is equal to the size of its congressional delegation, each state is entitled to at least 3 regardless of its population, and the apportionment of the statutorily fixed number of the rest is only roughly proportional.This allocation has contributed to runners-up of the nationwide popular vote being elected president in 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016.[7][8] In addition, faithless electors may not vote in accord with their pledge.[9][c] Further objection is that candidates focus their campaigns on swing states.[11].\nQ: when does the electoral college votes", "output": "Reasoning: The United

Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan and Niger\u2013Congo.Nigeria also has several as-yet unclassified languages, such as Cent\u00fa\u00fam, which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families.[8].English is the single most widely spoken language in Nigeria, spoken by 60 million of the population.[9] It is the main lingua franca of the country and there are a growing number of sole English speakers due to rapid urbanisation and globalisation.[10] English remains the official language and is the major language of communication in government, business and education.[10] Furthermore, the national anthem, constitution and pledge are written in English.Almost all mass media transmit information in English.[11] English became the official language when Nigeria was created from diverse national groups by the British Empire.[11] Despite decolonisation, Nigeria chose to make English the official language to promote national cultural unity[12] and so not to favour any particular native language.[11].Despite its status, English is not widely spoken in rural areas.[13] Many Nigerians struggle with English, evidenced by the 60 percent fail rate of the WASSCE in English (May/June 2015), an important exam certificate.[10] Nevertheless, many Nigerians hold negative social attitudes towards the country's native languages, combining to lead to the neglect of Nigeria's many native languages.As such, there are fears from prominent linguists that Nigerian native languages are endangered and face eventual extinction.[11].Many Nigerians speak Nigerian Pidgin, a creole language based on English, which has replaced the native language for many Nigerians.Pidgin is a popular social and cultural language.[11] It has become popular in the mass media and in political slogans.[14][15][11] According to a 2012 study, the replacement of native local languages with Pidgin is inevitable in the areas studied.[16].The Afroasiatic languages of Nigeria are divided into Chadic, Semitic and Berber.[17] Among these categories, Chadic languages predominate, with more than 700 languages.\nQ: what are two

{"input": "Context: Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by variola virus (often called smallpox virus)  which belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus.[7][11] The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977, and the World Health Organization (WHO) certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980,[10] making smallpox the only human disease to be eradicated.[12].The initial symptoms of the disease included fever and vomiting.[5] This was followed by formation of ulcers in the mouth and a skin rash.[5] Over a number of days, the skin rash turned into the characteristic fluid-filled blisters with a dent in the center.[5] The bumps then scabbed over and fell off, leaving scars.[5] The disease was transmitted from one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person or (rarely) via contaminated objects.[6][13][14] Prevention was achieved mainly through the smallpox vaccine.[9] Once the disease had developed, certain antiviral medications could potentially have helped, but such medications did not become available until after the disease was eradicated.[9] The risk of death was about 30%, with higher rates among babies.[6][15] Often, those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin, and some were left blind.[6].The earliest evidence of the disease dates to around 1500 BC in Egyptian mummies.[16][17] The disease historically occurred in outbreaks.[10] In 18th-century Europe, it is estimated that 400,000 people died from the disease per year, and that one-third of all cases of blindness were due to smallpox.[10][18] Smallpox is estimated to have killed up to 300million people in the 20th century[19][20] and around 500million people in the last 100 years of its existence.[21] Earlier deaths included six European monarchs.[10][18] As recently as 1967, 15million cases occurred a year.[10].Inoculation for smallpox appears to have started in China around the 1500s.[22][23] Europe adopted this practice from Asia in the first half of the 18th century.[24] In 1796, Edward Jenner introduced the modern smallpox vaccine.[25][26] In 1967, the WHO intensified efforts to eliminate the disease.[10] Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated, the other being rinderpest (a disease of even-toed ungulates) in 2011.[27][28] The term \"smallpox\" was first used in England in the 16th century to distinguish the disease from syphilis, which was then known as the \"great pox\".[29][30] Other historical names for the disease include pox, speckled monster, and red plague.[3][4][30].There are two forms of the smallpox.Variola major is the severe and most common form, with a more extensive rash and higher fever.Variola minor is a less common presentation, causing less severe disease, typically discrete smallpox, with historical death rates of 1% or less.[32] Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common.[33] In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons.This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by viral culture.[33] In addition, there were two very rare and fulminating types of smallpox, the malignant (flat) and hemorrhagic forms, which were usually fatal..The initial symptoms were similar to other viral diseases that are still extant, such as influenza and the common cold: fever of at least 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F), muscle pain, malaise, headache and fatigue.As the digestive tract was commonly involved, nausea, vomiting, and backache often occurred.The early prodromal stage usually lasted 2\u20134 days.By days 12\u201315, the

fastest stock-appearing racers around.[3].Gassers are based on closed body production models[Note 1] from the 1930s to mid-1960s, which have been stripped of extraneous weight and jacked up using a beam axle or tubular axle to provide better weight distribution on acceleration (beam axles are also lighter than an independent front suspension), though a raised stock front suspension is common as well.Common weight reduction techniques include fiberglass body panels, stripped interiors, and Lexan windows (sometimes color tinted)..The 1933-36 Willys coup\u00e9s and pickups were very popular gassers.[4] The best-known would be the 1933 Willys 77.[4]  While neither cheap nor plentiful, it was a competitive and lightweight choice satisfying the rules of the era (which required a ladder frame).At least one gasser incorporated a Willys frame in a Ford body to placate their sponsor while keeping it track-legal.[5] [4] Keith Ferrell's Dogcatcher, for instance, was a 1936 delivery with a fuel injected small-block Chevrolet, built for the class; in 1967, Ferrell deliberately left something off to run it in B/Altered (later, with a supercharger, in BB/A).[6].After the company revived, the 1937-42 coup\u00e9s, sedans, and pickups were again popular with hot rodders and gasser teams, and again, comparatively low production leaves unexplained why they gained so much attention.[4]

wheelstander.[8].Postwar Willyses were also used (such as the Bremerton, Washington-based Speed Sport Specialties 1954 Willys in B/Gas), but, despite being a better chassis than the 1955-7 Chevrolet, were never as popular as the prewar cars.[9].Combinations could be unusual.Fujimo, Too! was a B/G 1950 Plymouth business coup\u00e9 (run by Adler and Trout) with an injected Oldsmobile and Hydro-Motive transmission.[10].NHRA first licensed women drivers in gas classes in 1963, when Roberta Leighton, member of the Dust Devils Car Club and driver of an injected El Camino, was first

of India's Tata Motors.[3] JLR currently builds Land Rovers in Brazil, China, India, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom.The Land Rover name was created in 1948 by the Rover Company for a utilitarian 4WD off-road vehicle; currently, the Land Rover range consists solely of upmarket and luxury sport utility vehicles..Land Rover was granted a Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1951,[4][5] and 50 years later, in 2001, it received a Queen's Award for Enterprise for outstanding contribution to international trade.[6] Over time, Land Rover grew into its own brand (and for a while also a company), encompassing a consistently growing range of four-wheel drive, off-road capable models.Starting with the much more upmarket 1970 Range Rover, and subsequent introductions of the mid-range Discovery and entry-level Freelander line (in 1989 and 1997), as well as the 1990 Land Rover Defender refresh, the marque today includes two models of Discovery, four distinct models of Range Rover, and after a three-year hiatus, a second generation of Defenders have gone into production for the 2020 model year\u2014in short or long wheelbase, as before..For half a century (from the original 1948 model, through 1997, when the Freelander was introduced), Land Rovers and Range Rovers exclusively relied on their trademark boxed-section vehicle frames.Land Rover used boxed frames in a direct product bloodline until the termination of the original Defender in 2016; and their last body-on-frame model was replaced by a monocoque with the third generation Discovery in 2017.Since then all Land Rovers and Range Rovers have a unified body and frame structure..Since 2010, Land Rover has also introduced two-wheel drive variants, both of the Freelander, and of the Evoque, after having built exclusively 4WD cars for 62 years.[7] The 2WD Freelander has been succeeded by a 2WD Discovery Sport, available in some markets.[8].Originally, these vehicles were simply called the 'Land Rover' \u2013 an off-road capable car model of the Rover Company.As 'Land Rover' became established as a brand, the 'Series' indication later became a retronym model name.[9] The Range Rover was introduced in 1970,

reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class.[10] The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of other antidepressants, and the differences are mostly confined to side effects.Sertraline is better tolerated than the older tricyclic antidepressants.Sertraline is effective for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD).However, for OCD, cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly in combination with sertraline, is a better treatment.[citation needed] Although approved for  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sertraline leads to only modest improvement in this condition.[11][12] Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently (luteal phase dosing) for its treatment.[13].Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of diarrhea, nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild.Similar to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a mildly elevated rate of suicidal thoughts in people under the age of 25 years old.It should not be used together with MAO inhibitor medication: this combination may cause serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening in some cases.Sertraline taken during pregnancy is associated with an increase in congenital heart defects in newborns.[14][15].Sertraline was invented and developed by scientists at Pfizer and approved for medical use in the United States in 1991.It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[16] It is available as a generic medication.[10] In 2016, sertraline was the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medication in the United States[17] and in 2020, it was the twelfth most commonly prescribed medication overall in the United States, with over 38million prescriptions.[18][19].Sertraline has been approved for major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),

Corporation[a] (commonly shortened to Exxon[4][5][6]) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation and the largest direct descendant of John D.Rockefeller's Standard Oil.The company, which took its present name in 1999 per the merger of Exxon and Mobil, is vertically integrated across the entire oil and gas industry, and within it is also a chemicals division which produces plastic, synthetic rubber, and other chemical products.ExxonMobil is headquartered near the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, though officially incorporated in the U.S.state of New Jersey.[7][8]:\u200a1.ExxonMobil's history traces its earliest roots to 1866 with the formation of the Vacuum Oil Company, itself acquired by Standard Oil in 1879.The company that is today known as ExxonMobil grew out of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (or Jersey Standard for short), the corporate entity which effectively controlled all of Standard Oil prior to its breakup.Jersey Standard grew alongside and with extensive partnership another Standard Oil descendant and its future merger partner, the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), both of which grew bigger by merging with various third companies like Humble Oil (which merged with Jersey Standard) and Vacuum Oil (merged with Socony).Both companies underwent rebranding in the 1960s and early 1970s, and by the time of the 1999 merger, Jersey Standard had been known as Exxon, and Socony known as Mobil.The merger agreement between Exxon and Mobil stipulated that Exxon would buy Mobil and rebrand as ExxonMobil, with Mobil's CEO becoming the vice-chairman of the company.[9].ExxonMobil is one of the world's largest and most powerful companies.ExxonMobil since its merger varied from the first to tenth largest publicly traded company by revenue, and has one of the largest market capitalizations out of any company.[10][11] As of 2023, in the most recent rankings released in the Fortune 500, ExxonMobil was ranked third, and twelfth on the Fortune Global 500.[12] ExxonMobil is the largest investor-owned oil company in the world, the largest oil company headquartered in the Western world, and the largest of the Big Oil companies in both production and market value.[13][14] ExxonMobil's reserves were 20billionBOE at the end of 2016 and the 2007 rates of production were expected to last more than 14 years.[15] With 21 oil refineries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 4.9 million barrels (780,000m3), ExxonMobil is the second largest oil refiner in the world, trailing only Sinopec.[16][17] Approximately 55.56% of the company's shares are held by institutions, the largest of which as of 2019 were The Vanguard Group (8.15%), BlackRock (6.61%), and State Street Corporation

Shakespeare.It was built in 1599 at Southwark, close to the south bank of the Thames, by Shakespeare's playing company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men.It was destroyed by fire on 29 June 1613.A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and stayed open until the  London theatre closures of 1642.As well as plays by Shakespeare, early works by Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker and John Fletcher were first performed here.[4].A modern reconstruction of the Globe, named \"Shakespeare's Globe\", opened in 1997 approximately 750 feet (230m) from the site of the original theatre.[5].Examination of old leases and parish records has identified the plot of land acquired for building The Globe as extending from the west side of modern-day Southwark Bridge Road eastwards as far as Porter Street and from Park Street southwards as far as the back of Gatehouse Square.[6][7] It was being offered for rent by Thomas Brend, who was a neighbour to John Heminges and Henry Condell,  actors with the Chamberlain's Men.[8].The precise location of the building remained unknown until a small part of the foundations, including one original pier base, was discovered in 1989 by the Department of Greater London Archaeology (now Museum of London Archaeology) beneath the car park at the rear of Anchor Terrace on Park Street.[9] The shape of the foundations is now replicated on the surface.As the majority of the foundations lies beneath 67\u201370 Anchor Terrace, a listed building, no further excavations have been permitted.[10].The Globe was owned by actors who were also shareholders in the Lord Chamberlain's Men.Two of the six Globe shareholders, Richard Burbage and his brother Cuthbert Burbage, owned double shares of the whole, or 25 per cent each; the other four men, Shakespeare, John Heminges, Augustine Phillips, and Thomas Pope, owned a single share, or 12.5 per cent.(Originally William Kempe was intended to be the seventh partner, but he sold out his share

three groups of non-vascular land plants (embryophytes): the liverworts, hornworts and mosses.[1] In the strict sense, Bryophyta consists of the mosses only.Bryophytes are characteristically limited in size and prefer moist habitats although they can survive in drier environments.[2] The bryophytes consist of about 20,000 plant species.[3][4] Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures (gametangia and sporangia), but they do not produce flowers or seeds.They reproduce sexually by spores and asexually by fragmentation or the production of gemmae.[5] Though bryophytes were considered a paraphyletic group in recent years, almost all of the most recent phylogenetic evidence supports the monophyly of this group, as originally classified by Wilhelm Schimper in 1879.[6] The term bryophyte comes from Ancient Greek  \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03bf\u03bd (br\u00faon)'tree moss, liverwort', and  \u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd (phut\u00f3n)'plant'..The defining features of bryophytes are:.Bryophytes exist in a wide variety of habitats.They can be found growing in a range of temperatures (cold arctics and in hot deserts), elevations (sea-level to alpine), and moisture (dry deserts to wet rain forests).Bryophytes can grow where vascularized plants cannot because they do not depend on roots for uptake of nutrients from soil.Bryophytes can survive on rocks and bare soil.[8].Like all land plants (embryophytes), bryophytes have life cycles with alternation of generations.[9] In each cycle, a haploid gametophyte, each of whose cells contains a fixed number of unpaired chromosomes, alternates with a diploid sporophyte, whose cells contain two sets of paired chromosomes.Gametophytes produce haploid sperm and eggs which fuse to form diploid zygotes that grow into sporophytes.Sporophytes produce haploid spores by meiosis, that grow into gametophytes..Bryophytes are gametophyte dominant,[10] meaning that the more prominent, longer-lived plant is the haploid gametophyte.\nQ: what are the characteristics of bryophytes", "output": "Reasoning: Some bryophytes do have specialized tissues for the transport of water; however since these do not contain lignin ,

development.[3] Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.[4].There are several forms of role-playing games.The original form, sometimes called the tabletop role-playing game (TRPG or TTRPG), is conducted through discussion, whereas in live action role-playing (LARP), players physically perform their characters' actions.[5] In both of these forms, an arranger called a game master (GM) usually decides on the rules and setting to be used, while acting as the referee; each of the other players takes on the role of a single character.[6].Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media, such as multiplayer text-based Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) and their graphics-based successors, massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs).Role-playing games also include single-player role-playing video games in which players control a character, or team of characters, who undertake(s) quests and may include player capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics.These electronic games sometimes share settings and rules with tabletop RPGs, but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative

storytelling.[2][10][11] Events, characters, and narrative structure give a sense of a narrative experience, and the game need not have a strongly-defined storyline.[12] Interactivity is the crucial difference between role-playing games and traditional fiction.Whereas a viewer of a television show is a passive observer, a player in a role-playing game makes choices that affect the story.[13] Such role-playing games extend an older tradition of storytelling games where a small party of friends collaborate to create a story..While simple forms of role-playing exist in traditional children's

association football team who play the furthest up the pitch and are therefore most responsible for scoring goals as well as assisting them.As with any attacking player, the role of the forward relies heavily on being able to create space for attack.[1] Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players..Attacking positions generally favour irrational players who ask questions to the defensive side of the opponent in order to create scoring chances, where they benefit from a lack of predictability in attacking play.Modern team formations normally include one to three forwards.For example, the common 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 includes one forward.[2] Less conventional formations may include more than three forwards, or sometimes none.[3][4].The traditional role of a centre-forward is to score the majority of goals on behalf of the team.If they are tall and physical players, with good heading ability, the player may also be used to get onto the end of crosses, win long balls, or receive passes and retain possession of the ball with their back to goal as teammates advance, in order to provide depth for their team or help teammates score by providing a pass ('through ball' into the box), the latter variation usually requiring quicker pace and good movement, in addition to finishing ability.Most modern centre-forwards operate in front of the second strikers or central attacking midfielders, and do the majority of the ball handling outside the box.The present role of a centre-forward is sometimes interchangeable with that of an attacking midfielder or second striker, however, especially in the 4\u20133\u20131\u20132 or 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132 formations.The

into law on July 30, 2019.[1].Domestic partnerships legally afford couples who choose not to marry \"the same rights, protections, and benefits, and...the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law...\" as married spouses.[2].Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the United States created by a legislature without court

lawyer's services that is payable only if a lawsuit is successful or results in a favorable settlement, usually in the form of a percentage of the amount recovered on behalf of the client.[1] Contingent fees may make it easier for people of limited means to pursue their civil rights since otherwise, to sue someone for a tort, one must first be wealthy enough to pursue such litigation in the first place.[2] Due to the risk of loss, attorneys will not take cases on a contingency basis unless they believe that the case has merit, although accepting cases on a contingency is not without risk.[3].Under a traditional contingency fee arrangement, a client is not charged attorney fees if he loses the case.If the client recovers damages from settlement or a favorable verdict, the attorney receives the fee from the recovery.The attorney's permitted fee varies depending on the country, and even local jurisdictions..For example, in the U.S.a contingency fee is based on the contractual agreement between the attorney and the party.The fee is calculated as a share of the eventual damage judgment or settlement obtained by the client.The percentage allowable as a contingency fee is subject to the ethical rules of professional conduct that require legal fees to be reasonable and, in some circumstances, by statutory limitations.[4] In some jurisdictions, contingent fees as high as 33% to 45% of recovery may be deemed reasonable.Attorneys charging unreasonable fees may be subject to professional sanctions..In the alternative, the contingency may come in the form of an additional

determine their usefulness.[1].To vet was originally a horse-racing term, referring to the requirement that a horse be checked for health and soundness by a veterinarian before being allowed to race.Thus, it has taken the general meaning \"to check\".[2].It is a figurative contraction of veterinarian, which originated in the mid-17th century.The colloquial abbreviation dates to the 1860s; the verb form of the word, meaning \"to treat an animal,\" came a few decades later\u2014according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest known usage is 1891[3]\u2014and was applied primarily in a horse-racing context (\"He vetted the stallion before the race,\" \"You should vet that horse before he races\", etc.)..By the early 1900s, vet had begun to be used as a synonym for evaluate, especially in the context of searching for flaws..[4].Candidates for political office are often thoroughly vetted..In the United States, following longstanding convention, a party's presidential nominee is expected to choose a vice presidential candidate to accompany them on their ticket.The practical reason for this is to ensure that presidential electors who are pledged to vote for a particular candidate for president can also be pledged to vote for a particular and separate candidate for vice president, thus making it highly likely that a clear majority of electors will elect political allies for president and vice president in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Twelfth Amendment..As a rule, in modern presidential elections, no person will be seriously considered for the vice presidential nomination without first undergoing a thorough evaluation by a team of advisers acting on behalf of the nominee.[5]  In later stages of the vetting process, the team will examine such items as a prospective vice presidential candidate's finances, personal conduct, and previous coverage in the media.[5]  The hurried vetting that preceded the selection by Republican nominee John McCain of his running mate Sarah Palin in 2008 was seen by many political observers as a mistake.[6].\nQ: what is a vetting process", "output": "Reasoning: Vetting is the

retail and service establishments.The prices are then adjusted for changes in quality or features.[citation needed] Changes in the CPI can be used to track inflation over time and to compare inflation rates between different countries.The CPI is not a perfect measure of inflation or the cost of living, but it is a useful tool for tracking these economic indicators.[2].A CPI is a statistical

unfavorable situation..A common explanation traces the phenomenon to ancient Celtic peoples, who believed it called on spirits or gods of the trees,[1][2] while Christians tie the practice to the wood of the cross of crucifixion.[2] A more modern theory from folklore researcher Steve Roud suggests it derives from a form of tag called \"Tiggy Touchwood\" in which players are safe from being tagged

contact point, to reduce wear and friction at the contact point..In the typical use-case of an overhead valve (pushrod) engine, the camshaft at the bottom of the engine pushes the pushrod upwards.The top of the pushrod presses upwards on one side of the rocker arm (located at the top of the engine), which causes the rocker arm to rotate.This rotation causes the other end of the rocker arm to press downwards on the top of the valve, which opens the valve by moving it downwards..A roller rocker is a rocker arm that uses needle bearings (or a single bearing ball in older engines) at the contact point between the rocker and the valve, instead of metal sliding on metal.This reduces friction, uneven wear and \"bell-mouthing\" of the valve guide.[1] Roller rockers can also be used in overhead cam engines.However, these generally have the roller at the point where the cam lobe contacts the rocker, rather than at the point where the rocker contacts the valve stem..Friction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller tip.A similar arrangement transfers the motion via another roller tip to a second rocker arm.[clarification needed] This rotates about the rocker shaft, and transfers the motion via a tappet to the valve..Some overhead camshaft engines employ short rocker arms, also known as fingers, in which the cam lobe pushes down (rather than up) on the

treatments for nerve injuries.When direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve cannot be accomplished without tension, the standard clinical treatment for peripheral nerve injuries is autologous nerve grafting.Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting, neural tissue engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment, especially for large defects.Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the central nervous system poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment.[1].The creation of artificial conduits is also known as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap are enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materials.[2] Whether the conduit is in the form of a biologic tube, synthetic tube or tissue-engineered conduit, it should facilitate neurotropic and neurotrophic communication between the proximal and distal ends of the nerve gap, block external inhibitory factors, and provide a physical guidance for axonal regrowth.[3] The most basic objective of a nerve guidance conduit is to combine physical, chemical, and biological cues under conditions that will foster tissue formation.[4].Materials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively.[5] Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements: scaffold structure, scaffold material, cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors and biomimetic materials.The choice of which physical, chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment, which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration.The factors that control material selection include biocompatibility, biodegradability,[6] mechanical integrity,[3] controllability during nerve growth, implantation and sterilization..In tissue engineering, the three main levels of scaffold structure are considered to be:.The superstructure of a conduit or scaffold is important for simulating in vivo conditions for nerve tissue formation.The extracellular matrix, which is mainly responsible for directing tissue growth and formation, has a complex superstructure created by many interwoven fibrous molecules.Ways of forming artificial superstructure include the use of thermo-responsive hydrogels, longitudinally oriented channels, longitudinally oriented fibers, stretch-grown axons, and nanofibrous

medication belonging to the aminopenicillin class of the penicillin family.The drug is used to treat bacterial infections[8] such as middle ear infection, strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, odontogenic infections, and urinary tract infections.[8] It is taken by mouth, or less commonly by injection.[8][9].Common adverse effects include nausea and rash.[8] It may also increase the risk of yeast infections and, when used in combination with clavulanic acid, diarrhea.[10] It should not be used in those who are allergic to penicillin.[8] While usable in those with kidney problems, the dose may need to be decreased.[8] Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding does not appear to be harmful.[8] Amoxicillin is in the \u03b2-lactam family of antibiotics.[8].Amoxicillin was discovered in 1958 and came into medical use in 1972.[11][12] Amoxil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1974,[4][5] and in the United Kingdom in 1977.[2] It is on the (WHO) World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[13][14] It is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in children.[15] Amoxicillin is available as a generic medication.[8]  In 2020, it was the 40th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15million prescriptions.[16][17].Amoxicillin is used in the treatment of a number of infections, including acute otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, skin infections, urinary tract infections, Salmonella infections, Lyme disease, and chlamydia infections.[8][18].Children with acute otitis media who are younger than six months of age are generally treated with amoxicillin or other antibiotics.Although most children with acute otitis media who are older than two years old do not benefit from treatment with amoxicillin or other antibiotics, such treatment may be helpful in children younger than two years old with acute otitis media that is bilateral or accompanied by ear drainage.[19] In the past, amoxicillin was dosed three times daily when used to treat acute otitis media, which resulted in missed doses in routine ambulatory practice.There is now evidence that two times daily dosing or once daily dosing has similar effectiveness.[20].Most sinusitis infections are caused by viruses, for which amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are ineffective,[21] and the small benefit gained by amoxicillin may be overridden by the adverse effects.[22].Amoxicillin is considered the first-line empirical treatment for most cases of uncomplicated bacterial sinusitis in children and adults when culture data is unavailable.[23][24][25] Amoxicillin is recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in adults by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, either alone (mild to moderate severity disease) or in combination with a macrolide.[26] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends amoxicillin as first-line treatment for pneumonia that is not \"severe\".[27] Amoxicillin is used in post-exposure inhalation of anthrax to prevent disease progression and for prophylaxis.[18].It is effective as one part of a multi-drug regimen for

known European contact with the Caribbean and Central and South America..The name Christopher Columbus is the anglicisation of the Latin Christophorus Columbus.Growing up on the coast of Liguria, he went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far north as the British Isles and as far south as what is now Ghana.He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo, who bore a son Diego, and was based in Lisbon for several years.He later took a Castilian mistress, Beatriz Enr\u00edquez de Arana, who bore a son, Ferdinand.[4][5][6].Largely self-educated, Columbus was knowledgeable in geography, astronomy, and history.He developed a plan to seek a western sea passage to the East Indies, hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade.After the Granada War, and Columbus's persistent lobbying in multiple kingdoms, the Catholic Monarchs, Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II agreed to sponsor a journey west.Columbus left Castile in August 1492 with three ships and made landfall in the Americas on 12 October, ending the period of human habitation in the Americas now referred to as the pre-Columbian era.His landing place was an island in the Bahamas, known by its native

independence) to investigate complaints and attempt to resolve them, usually through recommendations (binding or not) or mediation..Ombudsmen sometimes also aim to identify systemic issues leading to poor service or breaches of people's rights.At the national level, most ombudsmen have a wide mandate to deal with the entire public sector, and sometimes also elements of the private sector (for example, contracted service providers).In some cases, there is a more restricted mandate to a certain sector of society.More recent developments have included the creation of specialized children's ombudsmen..In some countries, an inspector general, citizen advocate or other official may have duties similar to those of a national ombudsman and may also be appointed by a legislature.Below the national level, an ombudsman may be appointed by a state, local, or municipal government.Unofficial ombudsmen may be appointed by, or even work for, a corporation such as a utility supplier, newspaper, NGO, or professional regulatory body..In some jurisdictions, an ombudsman charged with handling concerns about national government is more formally referred to as the \"parliamentary commissioner\" (e.g.the United Kingdom Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, and the Western Australian state Ombudsman).In many countries where the ombudsman's responsibility includes protecting human rights, the ombudsman is recognized as the national human rights institution.The post of ombudsman had by the end of the 20th century been instituted by most governments and by some

powers.This reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July.Russia came to Serbia's defence, and by 4 August, Germany, France, and Britain were drawn into the war, with the Ottoman Empire joining in November of that same year..Germany's strategy in 1914 was to first defeat France, then transfer forces to the Russian front.However, this failed, and by the end of 1914, the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland.The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives.\nQ: when did wwi

other names) was a civil war in the United States between the Union[e] (\"the North\") and the Confederacy (\"the South\"), which had been formed by states that had seceded from the Union.The cause of the war was the dispute over whether slavery would be permitted to expand into the western territories, leading to more slave states, or be prevented from doing so, which many believed would place slavery on a course of ultimate extinction..Decades of political controversy over slavery were brought to a head by the victory in the 1860 U.S.presidential election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed slavery's expansion into the western territories.Seven southern slave states responded to Lincoln's victory by seceding from the United States and forming the Confederacy.The Confederacy seized U.S.forts and other federal assets within their borders.Four more southern states seceded after the war began and, led by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy asserted control over about a third of the U.S.population in eleven states.Four years of intense combat, mostly in the South, ensued..\nQ: what triggered the civil war", "output": "Reasoning: The war had its origin in the

expulsion of fluid from the Skene's gland at the lower end of the urethra during or before an orgasm.It is also known colloquially as squirting (or gushing), although research indicates that female ejaculation and squirting are different phenomena,  squirting being attributed to a sudden expulsion of liquid that partly comes from the bladder and contains urine.[1][2].Female ejaculation is physiologically distinct from coital incontinence, with which it is sometimes confused.[3][4].There have been few studies on female ejaculation.[5] A failure to adopt common definitions and research methodology by the scientific community has been the primary contributor to this lack of experimental data.[6] Research has suffered from highly selected participants, narrow case studies, or very small sample sizes, and consequently has yet to produce significant results.Much of the research into the composition of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is, or contains, urine.[5][7] It is common for any secretion that exits the vagina, and for fluid that exits the urethra, during sexual activity to be referred to as female ejaculate, which has led to significant confusion in the literature.[7].Whether the fluid is secreted by the Skene's gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals, and are related to doubts over the existence of the G-spot,[8][9][7] there is substantial evidence that the Skene's gland is the source of female ejaculation.[1][7] The function of female ejaculation, however, remains unclear.[7].In questionnaire surveys, 35\u201350% of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm.[10][11][12] Other studies find anywhere from 10 to 69%, depending on the definitions and methods used.[13][14] For instance Kratochv\u00edl (1994) surveyed 200 women and found that 6% reported ejaculating, an additional 13% had some experience and about 60% reported release of fluid without actual gushing.[15] Reports on the volume of fluid expelled vary considerably, starting from amounts that would be imperceptible to a woman, to mean values of 1\u20135 ml.[16].The suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women's health writer Rebecca Chalker as \"one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology\".[17] Female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical, medical, and biological literature throughout recorded history.The reasons for the interest in female ejaculation have been questioned by feminist writers.[18].In the 16th century, the Dutch physician Laevinius Lemnius, referred to how a woman \"draws forth the man's seed and casts her own with it\".[19] In the 17th century, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriceau described glands at the female urethral meatus that \"pour out great quantities of saline liquor during coition, which increases the heat and enjoyment of women\".[20] This century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function,[21] in particular the work of the Bartholin family in Denmark..In the 17th century, the Dutch anatomist Reinier de Graaf wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs Concerning the Generative Organs of Women which is much cited in the literature on this topic.De Graaf discussed the original controversy but supported the Aristotelian view.[22][23] He identified the source as the glandular structures and ducts

Cellular respiration is the process by which biological fuels are oxidized in the presence of an inorganic electron acceptor, such as oxygen, to drive the bulk production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which contains energy.Cellular respiration may be described as a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from nutrients into ATP, and then release waste products.[1].Cellular respiration is a vital process that happens in the cells of living organisms, including humans, plants, and animals.It's how cells produce energy to power all the activities necessary for life..The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, producing large amounts of energy (ATP).Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity.The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions.Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it is an unusual one because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions..Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent is molecular oxygen (O2).The chemical energy stored in ATP (the bond of its third phosphate group to the rest of the molecule can be broken allowing more stable products to form, thereby releasing energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes..Aerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP.Although carbohydrates, fats and proteins  are consumed as reactants, aerobic respiration is the preferred method of pyruvate production in glycolysis, and requires pyruvate to the mitochondria in order to be fully oxidized by the citric acid cycle.\nQ: where does cellular respiration occur", "output": "Reasoning: Cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of

heralded as a spokesman of Generation X and is highly recognized as one of the most influential alternative rock musicians..Cobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene that later became known as grunge.After signing with DGC Records, Nirvana found commercial success with the single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" from their critically acclaimed second album Nevermind (1991).Although Cobain was hailed as the voice of his generation following Nirvana's sudden success, he resented this, believing his message and artistic vision had been misinterpreted by the public.In addition to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", Cobain wrote many other hit songs for Nirvana, including \"Come as You Are\", \"Lithium\", \"In Bloom\", \"Something in the Way\", \"Heart-Shaped Box\", \"All Apologies\", \"About a Girl\", \"Aneurysm\",[1] and \"You Know You're Right\".[2].During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with a heroin addiction and chronic health problems such as depression.[3] He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame, and he had a tumultuous relationship with his wife, fellow musician Courtney Love.[4] In March 1994, Cobain overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol, and he subsequently entered an intervention and underwent a detox program.On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home at the age of 27;[5] police concluded he had died on April 5 from a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head..Cobain was posthumously inducted into the

which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning.The fruit is a drupe (stonefruit) which is about 5mm (0.20in) in diameter (fresh and fully mature), dark red, and contains a stone which encloses a single pepper seed.Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit), or white pepper (ripe fruit seeds).[2].Black pepper is native to the Malabar Coast[3][4] of India, and the Malabar pepper is extensively cultivated there and in other tropical regions..Ground, dried, and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a traditional medicine.Black pepper is the world's most traded spice,[5] and is one of the most

College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students.Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities.Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old (or older), except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age limit is 14 years.[6] As of December2022[update], Facebook claimed 3billion monthly active users.[7] As of October 2023 Facebook ranked as the 3rd most visited website in the world with 22.56% of its traffic coming from the United States.[8][9] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[10].Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones.After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves.They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their \"friend\" or, with different privacy settings, publicly.Users can also communicate directly with each other with Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow..The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S.elections) and mass surveillance.[11] Facebook has also been subject to criticism over psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and various controversies over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech.[12] Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content, as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.[13].Zuckerberg built a website called \"Facemash\" in 2003 while attending Harvard University.The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used \"photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the \"hotter\" person\".[15] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.[16] The site was sent to several campus

long tracheary elements that transport water.Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.[6].Xylem also contains two other type of cells: parenchyma and fibers.[7].Xylem can be found:.In transitional stages of plants with secondary growth, the first two categories are not mutually

"Context: Fuck is an English-language profanity which often refers to the act of sexual intercourse, but is also commonly used as an intensifier or to convey disdain.While its origin is obscure, it is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475CE.[1] In modern usage, the term fuck and its derivatives (such as fucker and fucking) are used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, an interjection or an adverb.There are many common phrases that employ the word as well as compounds that incorporate it, such as motherfucker, fuckwit, fuckup, fucknut, fucktard, and fuck off..It is unclear whether the word has always been considered a pejorative or, if not, when it first came to be used to describe (often in an extremely angry, hostile or belligerent manner) unpleasant circumstances or people in an intentionally offensive way, such as in the term motherfucker, one of its more common usages in some parts of the English-speaking world.Some English-speaking countries censor it on television and radio.Andrea Millwood Hargrave's 2000 study of the attitudes of the British public found that fuck was considered the third-most-severe profanity, and its derivative motherfucker second.Cunt was considered the most severe.[2].Nevertheless, the word has increasingly become less of a pejorative and more publicly acceptable, an example of the \"dysphemism treadmill\" or semantic drift known as melioration, wherein former pejoratives become inoffensive and commonplace.[3][4] Because of its increasing usage in the public forum, in 2005 the word was included for the first time as one of three vulgarities in The Canadian Press's Canadian Press Caps and Spelling guide.Journalists were advised to refrain from censoring the word but use it sparingly and only when its inclusion was essential to the story.[5] According to linguist Pamela Hobbs, \"notwithstanding its increasing public use, enduring cultural models that inform our beliefs about the nature of sexuality and sexual acts preserve its status as a vile utterance that continues to inspire moral outrage.\" Hobbs considers users rather than usage of the word and sub-divides users into \"non-users\", for whom \"the word belongs to a set of taboo words, the very utterance of which constitutes an affront, and any use of the word, regardless of its form (verb, adjective, adverb, etc.) or meaning (literal or metaphorical) evokes the core sexual meanings and associated sexual imagery that motivate the taboo.\"; and \"users\", for whom \"metaphorical uses of the word fuck no more evoke images of sexual intercourse than a ten-year-old's 'My mom'll kill me if she finds out' evokes images of murder,\" so that the \"criteria of taboo are missing.\"[6].The Oxford English Dictionary states that the ultimate etymology is uncertain, but that the word is \"probably cognate\" with a number of Germanic words with meanings involving striking, rubbing and having sex or is derivative of the Old French word that meant 'to have sex'.[7].The word has probable cognates in other Germanic languages, such as German ficken ('to fuck'); Dutch fokken ('to breed', 'to beget'); Afrikaans fok ('to fuck');[8] Icelandic fokka ('to mess around', 'to rush');[9] dialectal Norwegian fukka ('to copulate'); and dialectal Swedish focka ('to strike', 'to copulate') and fock ('penis').[7] This points to a possible etymology where Common Germanic *fuk(k)\u014dn-from the verbal root *fug- ('to blow')[9] comes from an Indo-European root *peuk-, or *peu\u011d- ('to strike'),[10] cognate with non-Germanic words such as Latin pugno ('I fight') or pugnus ('fist').[7] By application of Grimm's law, this hypothetical root also has the Pre-Germanic form *pug-n\u00e9h2- (''to blow'),[9] which is the etymon of, amongst others, Dutch fok(zeil) ('foresail').[11] There is a theory that fuck is most likely derived from German or Dutch roots, and is probably not derived from an Old English root.[12].One reason that the word fuck is difficult to trace etymologically is that it was used far more extensively in common speech, rather than in easily traceable documents or writings.\nQ: when did the word fuck begin", "output":

million wounded, plus another 5 million civilian deaths from various causes.Millions more died as a result of genocide, and the war was a major factor in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic..The first decade of the 20th century saw increasing diplomatic tension between the European great powers.This reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated

signed into law by President Richard Nixon.[1] The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs..The legislation created five schedules (classifications), with varying qualifications for a substance to be included in each.Two federal agencies, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), determine which substances are added to or removed from the various schedules, although the statute passed by Congress created the initial listing.Congress has sometimes scheduled other substances through legislation such as the Hillory J.Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Prevention Act of 2000, which placed gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) in Schedule I and sodium oxybate (the isolated sodium salt in GHB) in Schedule III when used under an FDA New Drug Application (NDA) or Investigational New Drug (IND).[2][3] Classification decisions are required to be made on criteria including potential for abuse (an undefined term),[4] currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and international treaties.The nation first outlawed addictive drugs in the early 1900s and the International Opium Convention helped lead international agreements regulating trade.[5][6][7] The Food and Drugs Act of 1906 was the beginning of over 200 laws concerning public health and consumer protections.[8] Others were the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (1938), and the Kefauver Harris Amendment of 1962.[9].In 1969, President Richard Nixon announced that the Attorney General, John N.Mitchell, was preparing a comprehensive new measure to more effectively meet the narcotic and dangerous drug problems at the federal level by combining all existing federal laws into a single new statute.With the help of White House Counsel head, John Dean; the Executive Director of the Shafer Commission, Michael Sonnenreich; and the Director of the BNDD, John Ingersoll creating and writing the legislation, Mitchell was able to present Nixon with the bill.[10].The CSA not only combined existing federal drug laws and expanded their scope, but it also changed the nature of federal drug law

County.Located at the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers in Northern California's Sacramento Valley, Sacramento's 2020 population of 524,943[7] makes it the fourth-most populous city in Northern California, sixth-most populous city in the state, and the ninth-most populous state capital in the United States.[9][10] Sacramento is the seat of the California Legislature and the Governor of California..Sacramento is also the cultural and economic core of the Greater Sacramento area, which at the 2020 census had a population of 2,680,831,[8] the fourth-largest metropolitan area in California.[11].Before the arrival of the Spanish, the area was inhabited by the Nisenan, Maidu, and other indigenous peoples of California.Spanish cavalryman Gabriel Moraga surveyed and named the R\u00edo del Sant\u00edsimo Sacramento (Sacramento River) in 1808, after the Blessed Sacrament.In 1839, Juan Bautista Alvarado, Mexican governor of Alta California, granted the responsibility of colonizing the Sacramento Valley to Swiss-born Mexican citizen John Augustus Sutter, who subsequently established Sutter's Fort and the settlement at the Rancho Nueva Helvetia.Following the American Conquest of California and the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the waterfront developed by Sutter began to be developed and incorporated in 1850 as the City of Sacramento.In 1852, the city offered its county courthouse to the state of California to house the state legislature, resulting in the city becoming the permanent state capital in 1854 and ushering in the construction of a new state capitol building which was finished in 1874.[12].Sacramento is the fastest-growing major city in California,[13] owing to its status as a notable political center on the West Coast and as a major educational hub, home of California State University, Sacramento and UC Davis.Similarly, Sacramento is a major center for the California healthcare industry, as the seat of Sutter Health, the world-renowned UC Davis Medical Center, and the UC Davis School of Medicine.In 2013, the Sacramento Convention and Visitors Bureau stated that the city receives 15.3 million visitors per year,[14] and

seven years, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians in the history of blues music, and one of the greatest guitarists of all time.He was the younger brother of guitarist Jimmie Vaughan..Born and raised in Dallas, Vaughan began playing guitar at age seven, initially inspired by his elder brother, Jimmie Vaughan.In 1972, he dropped out of high school and moved to Austin, where he began to gain a following after playing gigs on the local club circuit.Vaughan joined forces with Tommy Shannon on bass and Chris Layton on drums as Double Trouble in 1978 and established it as part of the Austin music scene; it soon became one of the most popular acts in Texas.He performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1982, where David Bowie saw him play.Bowie contacted him for a studio gig that resulted in Vaughan playing blues guitar on the album Let's Dance (1983), before being discovered by John Hammond who interested major label Epic Records in signing Vaughan and his band to a record deal.Within months, they achieved mainstream success for the critically acclaimed debut album Texas Flood.With a series of successful network television appearances and extensive concert tours, Vaughan became the leading figure in the blues revival of the 1980s..During the majority of his life, Vaughan struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction.He also struggled with the personal and

Constitution's fundamental purposes and guiding principles.Courts have referred to it as reliable evidence of the Founding Fathers' intentions regarding the Constitution's meaning and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve..The preamble was mainly written by Gouverneur Morris, a Pennsylvania delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention held at Independence Hall in Philadelphia..We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence,[note 1] promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America..The Preamble was placed in the Constitution during the last days of the Constitutional Convention by the Committee on Style, which wrote its final draft, with Gouverneur Morris leading the effort.It was not proposed or discussed on the floor of the convention beforehand.The initial wording of the preamble did not refer to the people of the United States; rather, it referred to people of the various states, which was the norm..In earlier documents, including the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, the Articles of Confederation, and the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognizing American independence, the word \"people\" was not used, and the phrase the United States was followed immediately by a listing of the states, from north to south.[1]  The change was made out of necessity, as the Constitution provided that, whenever the popularly elected ratifying conventions of nine states gave their approval, it would go into effect for those nine, irrespective of whether any of the remaining states ratified.[2].The Preamble serves solely as an introduction and does not assign powers to the federal government,[3] nor does it provide specific limitations on government action.Due to the Preamble's limited nature, no court has ever used it as a decisive factor in case adjudication,[4] except as regards frivolous litigation.[5].The courts have shown interest in any clues they can find in the Preamble regarding the Constitution's meaning.[6] Courts have developed several techniques for interpreting the meaning of statutes and these are also used to interpret the Constitution.[7] As a result, the courts have said that interpretive techniques that focus on the exact text of a document[8] should be used in interpreting the meaning of the Constitution.Balanced against these techniques are those that focus more attention on broader efforts to discern the meaning of the document from more than just the wording;[9] the Preamble is also useful for these efforts to identify the \"spirit\" of the Constitution..\nQ: what is in the

Comet, Comet Halley, or sometimes simply Halley, officially designated 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet visible from Earth every 75\u201379 years.[1] Halley is the only known short-period comet that is regularly visible to the naked eye from Earth, and thus the only naked-eye comet that can appear twice in a human lifetime.[15] It last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061..Halley's periodic returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers around the world since at least 240 BC.But it was not until 1705 that the English astronomer Edmond Halley understood that these appearances were re-appearances of the same comet.As a result of this discovery, the comet is named after Edmond Halley.[16].During its 1986 visit to the inner Solar System, Halley's Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation.[17][18] These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's \"dirty snowball\" model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices\u2014such as water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and dust.The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy..Comet Halley is commonly pronounced /\u02c8h\u00e6li/, rhyming with valley, or /\u02c8he\u026ali/, rhyming with daily.[19][20] Colin Ronan, one of Edmond Halley's biographers, preferred /\u02c8h\u0254\u02d0li/, rhyming with crawly.[21] Spellings of Halley's name during his lifetime included Hailey, Haley, Hayley, Halley, Hawley, and Hawly, so its contemporary pronunciation is uncertain, but the version rhyming with valley seems to be preferred by current bearers of the surname.[22].Halley was the first comet to be recognized as periodic.Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere.This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must

therefore, elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant may lead to a cancer diagnosis and, if high enough, paraneoplastic syndromes, however, it is not known whether this production is a contributing cause, or an effect of carcinogenesis.The pituitary analog of hCG, known as luteinizing hormone (LH), is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages.[1][3].Various endogenous forms of hCG exist.The measurement of these diverse forms is used in the diagnosis of pregnancy and a variety of disease states.[1] Preparations of hCG from various sources have also been used therapeutically, by both medicine and quackery.As of December6, 2011[update], the United States Food and Drug Administration has prohibited the sale of \"homeopathic\" and over-the-counter hCG diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal.[4][5][6].Beta-hCG is initially secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast.[citation needed].Human chorionic gonadotropin is a glycoprotein composed of 237 amino acids with a molecular mass of 36.7 kDa, approximately 14.5kDa \u03b1hCG and 22.2kDa \u03b2hCG.[7].It is heterodimeric, with an \u03b1 (alpha) subunit identical to that of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and a \u03b2 (beta) subunit that is unique to hCG..The two subunits create a small hydrophobic core surrounded by a high surface area-to-volume ratio: 2.8 times that of a sphere.The vast majority of the outer amino acids are hydrophilic.[10].\nQ: what is human chorionic", "output": "Reasoning: In molecular biology , human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the fertilized egg after conception ."}, {"input": "Context: No context\nQ: where is dear john filmed at", "output": "Reasoning: The movie was filmed in 2009 in Charleston, South Carolina ."}, {"input": "Context: No context\nQ: what is busiest airport in US", "output": "Reasoning: Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the busiest single airport in the United States."}, {"input": "Context: No context\nQ: where is osaka japan", "output": "Reasoning: is a city in the Kansai region of Japan's main island of Honshu , a designated city under the Local Autonomy Law , the capital city of Osaka Prefecture and also the largest part of the Keihanshin metropolis, which comprises three major cities of Japan, Kyoto , Osaka and Kobe ."}, {"input": "Context: No context\nQ: where is osaka japan", "output": "Reasoning: Located at the mouth of the Yodo River on Osaka Bay , Osaka is Japan's third largest city by population after Tokyo (special wards) and Yokohama ."}, {"input": "Context: No context\nQ: what is surname and given name", "output": "Reasoning: A given name, in Western contexts often referred to as a first name, is a personal name that specifies and differentiates between members of a group of individuals, especially in a family, all of whose members usually share the same family name (surname)."}, {"input": "Context: No context\nQ: what is melissa and joey about", "output": "Reasoning: The series follows local politician Mel Burke (Melissa Joan Hart) and Joe Longo (Joey Lawrence), whom Mel hires to look after her niece and nephew after a Ponzi scheme leaves him broke."}, {"input": "Context: No context\nQ: What is an economic feature?", "output": "Reasoning: Other broad distinctions include those between positive economics (describing \"what is\") and normative economics (advocating \"what ought to be\");
