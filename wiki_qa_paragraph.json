{"Glacier cave": "A glacier cave is a cave formed within the ice of a glacier.Glacier caves are often called ice caves, but the latter term is properly used to describe bedrock caves that contain year-round ice.[1].Most glacier caves are started by water running through or under the glacier.This water often originates on the glacier's surface through melting, entering the ice at a moulin and exiting at the glacier's snout at base level.Heat transfer from the water can cause sufficient melting to create an air-filled cavity, sometimes aided by solifluction.Air movement can then assist enlargement through melting in summer and sublimation in winter..Some glacier caves are formed by geothermal heat from volcanic vents or hotsprings beneath the ice.An extreme example is the Kverkfj\u00f6ll glacier cave in the Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland, measured in the 1980s at 2.8 kilometres (1.7mi) long with a vertical range of 525 metres (1,722ft)..Some glacier caves are relatively unstable due to melting and glacial motion, and are subject to localized or complete collapse, as well as elimination by glacial retreat.An example of the dynamic nature of glacier caves is the former Paradise Ice Caves, located on Mount Rainier in the United States.Known since the early 1900s, the caves were thought to have disappeared altogether in the mid-1940s, yet in 1978 cavers measured 13.25 kilometres (8.23mi) of passageways in glacier caves there, and it was then considered the longest glacier cave system in the world.The Paradise Ice Caves collapsed and vanished in the 1990s, and the lower lobe of the glacier which once contained the caves has also vanished entirely between 2004 and 2006..", "Circular motion": "In physics, circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular arc.It can be uniform, with a constant rate of rotation and constant tangential speed, or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation.The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves the circular motion of its parts.The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body, which remains at a constant distance from the axis of rotation.In circular motion, the distance between the body and a fixed point on its surface remains the same, i.e., the body is assumed rigid..Examples of circular motion include: special satellite orbits around the Earth (circular orbits), a ceiling fan's blades rotating around a hub, a stone that is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles, a car turning through a curve in a race track, an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, and a gear turning inside a mechanism..Since the object's velocity vector is constantly changing direction, the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation.Without this acceleration, the object would move in a straight line, according to Newton's laws of motion..In physics, uniform circular motion describes the motion of a body traversing a circular path at a constant speed.Since the body describes circular motion, its distance from the axis of rotation remains constant at all times.Though the body's speed is constant, its velocity is not constant: velocity, a vector quantity, depends on both the body's speed and its direction of travel.This changing velocity indicates the presence of an acceleration; this centripetal acceleration is of constant magnitude and directed at all times toward the axis of rotation.", "Apollo Creed": "Apollo Creed is a fictional character from the Rocky films, played by Carl Weathers.He played in the series' first four films,He serves as the main antagonist in Rocky and Rocky II, and became one of the protagonists in Rocky III and Rocky IV.The character was inspired by the real-life boxer champion Muhammad Ali, having what one author remarked as the same \"brash, vocal, [and] theatrical\" personality.The film's writer and star Sylvester Stallone stated, \"[Jack] Johnson served as the inspiration for the character of Apollo Creed in the Rocky movies\";[1] the character is loosely based on a combination of Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Joe Louis, and Johnson.[2].Protagonist Rocky Balboa, Creed's rival in Rocky and Rocky II, faces underdog odds (five-to-one in Rocky II) and views Creed with respect, pointedly refusing the prodding of a reporter to trash-talk Creed (although it is implied that, being poorly educated at that point, he didn't understand the meaning of the word \"derogatory\"), even after the flamboyant Creed publicly taunted him by laconically remarking, \"He's great.\"[3][4][5][6].In Rocky, Creed essentially cleans out his division of serious challengers (the few remaining being either injured or unavailable) and magnanimously decides to fight local journeyman Balboa for the fan spectacle, as well as the implied symbolism of fighting a man with an Italian background on \"this country's biggest birthday.\"[7] In the film and its sequel, Balboa and Creed find themselves basically evenly matched in the ring, ending up friends by the third movie.Creed had multiple nicknames, including most prominently \"The Master of Disaster\".[3] Others include \"The King of Sting\", \"The Dancing Destroyer\", \"The Prince of Punch\", and \"The Count of Monte Fisto\".A 2013 poll of former heavyweight champions and boxing writers, including former WBA heavyweight star James \"Bonecrusher\" Smith, ranked Creed as the second-best boxer in the Rocky series, second only to Rocky himself, having only 2 losses: one to Rocky and the other, Ivan Drago, who killed him in their fight.[8].In the Rocky and Creed films, Apollo Creed is a heavyweight boxing champion who is a rival and later friend of Rocky Balboa.Michael Wilbon of Pardon the Interruption describes Creed as \"maybe the best of all time; in the discussion\"..Apollo Creed first appears in the 1976 Oscar-winning film Rocky as the charismatic, intelligent, and undefeated 33-year-old World Heavyweight Champion.A planned Bicentennial fight against number-one contender Mac Lee Green was scheduled for January 1, 1976, which Creed gladly hypes whenever someone places a microphone in front of him.", "United States federal judge": "In the United States, federal judges are judges who serve on courts established under Article Three of the U.S.Constitution.They include the chief justice and associate justices of the U.S.Supreme Court, circuit judges of the U.S.Courts of Appeals, district judges of the U.S.District Courts, and judges of the U.S.Court of International Trade.These judges are often called \"Article Three judges\"..Unlike the president and vice president of the United States and U.S.senators and representatives, U.S.federal judges are not elected officials.They are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, pursuant to the Appointments Clause of Article Two of the U.S.", "Beretta 21A Bobcat": "The Beretta 21A Bobcat is a semi-automatic pocket pistol designed by Beretta in Italy.Production began in the late 1984, solely in the Beretta U.S.A.facility in Accokeek, Maryland.It is a further development of the Beretta Model 20, whose production ended in 1985.[1].The Beretta 21A Bobcat is available chambered for either .22 LR or .25 ACP (6.35mm) ammunition.It has a simple blowback operation, with a single- and double-action trigger mechanism, and exposed hammer.It has a magazine release button in the left side grip, located between the grip retaining screws.The frame is made out of aluminum alloy; the slide and barrel are either carbon steel or stainless steel, depending on the model.[3] According to Beretta, the pistol is intended for off duty police and pistol carry permit holders that seek a highly concealable, but reliable pistol designed for self-defense.[2].It is fitted with a frame-mounted, thumb-operated rear-locking safety, which also blocks the slide.This can be applied with the hammer fully down, or cocked.The hammer has a half-cock safety notch.There is an inertia type firing pin design.[4].", "Variable universal life insurance": "Variable universal life insurance (often shortened to VUL) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value.In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner.The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary\u2014they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets.The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments.The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance.This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium)..Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance, because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies at any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy.With most if not all VULs, unlike whole life, there is no endowment age (the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount, which for whole life is typically 100).This is yet another key advantage of VUL over Whole Life.With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out.Thus with either death or endowment, the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years.However, some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase \"paid up additions\" to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time..", "Outdoor wood-fired boiler": "The outdoor wood boiler is a variant of the classic wood stove adapted for set-up outdoors while still transferring the heat to interior buildings..The outdoor wood boiler is a variant on the indoor wood, oil or gas boiler.An outdoor wood boiler or outdoor wood stove is a unit about 4-6 feet wide and around 10 feet long.It is made up of four main parts- the firebox, which can be either round or square, the water jacket, the heat exchanger, and the weather proof housing.The fire box ranges from 2 to 5 feet long and can be as tall as 4 feet.The firebox and heat exchanger are surrounded by water or a glycol-water solution, which absorb heat from the burning wood.The heated water is generally circulated through insulated underground lines to a heating load, where the heat can be transferred from the water to various heat emitters.[1].Standard outdoor wood boilers heat the firebox and the smoke goes out the exhaust straight.If not run hot enough, the exhaust gas will be thick and black, and the resulting ash will not be fully rendered.[2]  While functional, these models take more work and are far less efficient[3] than some newer more efficient models..Some newer outdoor wood boilers have a catalytic converter installed, to allow for a more efficient burn and treatment of the exhaust before it leaves the unit.There is a considerable difference in cost between these and standard units.These are far less popular than gasification outdoor wood boilers.[2].", "Girl Scout Cookies": "Girl Scout Cookies are cookies sold by Girl Scouts in the United States to raise funds to support Girl Scout councils and individual troops.The cookies are widely popular and are commonly sold by going door-to-door, online, through school or town fundraisers, or at \"cookie booths\" set up at storefronts.[1] The program is intended to both raise money and improve the financial literacy of girls.During an average selling season (usually January through April), more than one million girls sell over 200 million packages of cookies and raise over $800 million.[2][3] The first known sale of cookies by Girl Scouts was in 1917.[4][5][6] Cookie sales are organized by 112 regional Girl Scout councils[7] who select one of two national bakeries to buy cookies from.[3][8].The bakery selected determines which cookie varieties are available, when girls can begin selling cookies in their area, and cookie price.[5][9][10] The bakery is paid about 25 to 35 percent of the profits; 45 to 65 percent is used by the regional council to cover programming costs; and 10 to 20 percent is kept by the local troop[11] whose members decide how to spend their portion of the funds.A regional council receives up to 60 percent of its budget from cookie sales.[12].The 5 skills the \u201ccookie program\u201d develops that girls will use throughout their lives:.The first known cookie sales by an individual Girl Scout unit were by the Mistletoe Troop in Muskogee, Oklahoma, in December 1917 at their local high school.[13] In 1922, the Girl Scout magazine The American Girl suggested cookie sales as a fundraiser and provided a simple sugar cookie recipe from a regional director for the Girl Scouts of Chicago.[14] In 1928, the Girl Scout manual suggested sales of cookies to make a troop self-supporting.[15] In 1933, Girl Scouts in Philadelphia organized the first commercial sale, selling homemade cookies at the windows of the Philadelphia Gas and Electric Company (PGE).In 1934, the first official cookie sale was by the Girl Scout Council, in Philadelphia, contracting with a commercial bakery.[15] From 1933 to 1935, organized cookie sales rose, with troops in Philadelphia and New York City using the cookie-selling model to develop the marketing and sales skills of their local troops.[16] In 1936, Girl Scouts of the USA began licensing commercial bakers to produce cookies, in order to increase availability and reduce lead time, starting with Keebler-Weyl Bakery.[17] Southern Biscuit Company and Burry Biscuit,[18][19] both later acquired by the Interbake Foods division of George Weston Limited, were added in 1937.One hundred twenty five troops launched cookie sales that first year.[20].During World War II the Girl Scouts sold calendars[21] in addition to cookies, because of shortages of flour, sugar, and butter.In 1943 there were 48 cookies per box.By 1943 Girl Scouts also collected fat in cans to aid the war effort and sold war bonds at no profit.[22][23][24][25][26]  In the 1950s, three more cookie recipes were added: \"Shortbreads\"/\"Scot-Teas\", \"Savannahs\" (today called \"Peanut Butter Sandwich\" in the west of the US or \u201cDo-si-dos\u201d in the east of the US), and \"Thin Mints\".", "Purdue University": "Purdue University is a public land-grant research university in West Lafayette, Indiana, and the flagship campus of the Purdue University system.[8] The university was founded in 1869 after Lafayette businessman John Purdue donated land and money to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name.[9] The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.[9] It has been ranked as among the best public universities in the United States by major institutional rankings, and is known for its engineering program.[10].The main campus in West Lafayette offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 70 masters and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy, veterinary medicine, and doctor of nursing practice.In addition, Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 1000 student organizations.Purdue is the founding member of the Big Ten Conference and enrolls the largest student body of any individual university campus in Indiana, as well as the ninth-largest foreign student population of any university in the United States.[11].Purdue University is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\".[12] Purdue has been affiliated with 13 Nobel laureates, 1 Turing Award laureate, 2 World Food Prize laureates, 3 Pulitzer Prize winners, 18 Olympic medalists, 3 National Medal of Technology and Innovation recipients, 2 National Medal of Science recipients, 3 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients, 7 members of Congress, 3 U.S.governors, and 2 heads of state.[13][14].In 1865, the Indiana General Assembly voted to take advantage of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862 and began plans to establish an institution with a focus on agriculture and engineering with the preliminary name of the Indiana Agricultural College.[15] Communities throughout the state offered facilities and funding in bids for the location of the new college.Popular proposals included designating Indiana University or what is now Butler University as Indiana's land-grant, as well as the addition of an agriculture department at what is now Indiana State University.By 1869, Tippecanoe County's offer included $150,000 (equivalent to $3.3 million in 2022) from Lafayette business leader and philanthropist John Purdue; $50,000 from the county; and 100 acres (0.4km2) of land from John Purdue and local residents.[16].On May 6, 1869, the General Assembly established the institution in Tippecanoe County as Purdue University, in the name of the principal benefactor.Classes began at Purdue on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.[9] Professor John S.Hougham was Purdue's first faculty member and served as acting president between the administrations of presidents Shortridge and White.[9][17] A campus of five buildings was completed by the end of 1874.[18] In 1875, Sarah A.", "Sebaceous cyst": "A sebaceous cyst is a term commonly used to refer to either:[1].Both of the above types of cysts contain keratin, not sebum, and neither originates from sebaceous glands.Epidermoid cysts originate in the epidermis and pilar cysts originate from hair follicles.Technically speaking, then, they are not sebaceous cysts.[2] \"True\" sebaceous cysts,  which originate from sebaceous glands and which contain sebum, are relatively rare and are known as steatocystoma simplex or, if multiple, as steatocystoma multiplex..Medical professionals have suggested that the term \"sebaceous cyst\" be avoided since it can be misleading.[3]:\u200a31\u200a In practice, however, the term is still often used for epidermoid and pilar cysts..The scalp, ears, back, face, and upper arm, are common sites of sebaceous cysts, though they may occur anywhere on the body except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.[4] They are more common in hairier areas, where in cases of long duration they could result in hair loss on the skin surface immediately above the cyst.They are smooth to the touch, vary in size, and are generally round in shape..They are generally mobile masses that can consist of:.The nature of the contents of a sebaceous cyst, and of its surrounding capsule, differs depending on whether the cyst has ever been infected..With surgery, a cyst can usually be excised in its entirety.Poor surgical technique, or previous infection leading to scarring and tethering of the cyst to the surrounding tissue, may lead to rupture during excision and removal.A completely removed cyst will not recur, though if the patient has a predisposition to cyst formation, further cysts may develop in the same general area..", "Pointe shoe": "A pointe shoe (UK: /pw\u00e6\u0303t/, US: /pw\u0251\u02d0nt, p\u0254\u02d0\u026ant/), also called a ballet shoe,[1][2][3][4] is a type of shoe worn by ballet dancers when performing pointe work.Pointe shoes were conceived in response to the desire for dancers to appear weightless and sylph-like and have evolved to enable dancers to dance en pointe (on the tips of their toes) for extended periods of time.They are manufactured in a variety of colors, most commonly in shades of light pink..Women began to dance ballet in 1681, twenty years after King Louis XIV of France ordered the founding of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse.[5] At that time, the standard women's ballet shoe had heels.In 1835 dancer Marie Camargo of the Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet was the first to wear a non-heeled shoe, enabling her to perform leaps that would have been difficult, if not impossible, in the more conventional shoes of the age.[6] After the French Revolution, heels were completely eliminated from standard ballet shoes.These flat-bottomed predecessors of the modern pointe shoe were secured to the feet by ribbons and incorporated pleats under the toes to enable dancers to leap, execute turns, and fully extend their feet..The first dancers to rise up on their toes did so with the help of an invention by Charles Didelot in 1796.[7] His \"flying machine\" lifted dancers upward, allowing them to stand on their toes before leaving the ground.[6] This lightness and ethereal quality was well received by audiences and, as a result, choreographers began to look for ways to incorporate more pointe work into their pieces..As dance progressed into the 19th century, the emphasis on technical skill increased, as did the desire to dance en pointe without the aid of wires.When Marie Taglioni first danced La Sylphide en pointe, her shoes were nothing more than modified satin slippers; the soles were made of leather and the sides and toes were darned to help the shoes hold their shapes.[8] Because the shoes of this period offered no support, dancers would pad their toes for comfort and rely on the strength of their feet and ankles for support..The next substantially different form of pointe shoe appeared in Italy in the late 19th century.Dancers like Pierina Legnani wore shoes with a sturdy, flat platform at the front end of the shoe, rather than the more sharply pointed toe of earlier models.These shoes also included a box\u2014made of layers of fabric\u2014for containing the toes, and a stiffer, stronger sole.", "Tablespoon": "A tablespoon (tbsp., Tbsp., Tb., or T.) is a large spoon.In many English-speaking regions, the term now refers to a large spoon used for serving;[1] however, in some regions, it is the largest type of spoon used for eating..By extension, the term is also used as a cooking measure of volume.In this capacity, it is most commonly abbreviated tbsp.or Tbsp.and occasionally referred to as a tablespoonful to distinguish it from the utensil.The unit of measurement varies by region: a United States tablespoon is approximately 14.8ml (0.50USfloz), a European, United Kingdom and Canadian tablespoon is exactly 15ml (0.51USfloz),[2] and an Australian tablespoon is 20ml (0.68USfloz).[3] The capacity of the utensil (as opposed to the measurement) is defined by neither law nor custom but only by preferences, and may or may not significantly approximate the measurement..Before about 1700, it was customary for Europeans to bring their own spoons to the table.Spoons were carried as personal property in much the same way as people today carry wallets, key rings, etc.", "Harry Potter": "Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J.K.Rowling.The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people)..The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States.A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[1] Major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, madness, and death.[2][3].Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide.They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are widely considered cornerstones of modern literature.[4][5] As of February2023[update], the books have sold more than 600million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been available in 85 languages.[6] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release..The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros.Pictures.In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25billion,[7] making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.", "Rocket engine": "A rocket engine uses stored rocket propellants as the reaction mass for forming a high-speed propulsive jet of fluid, usually high-temperature gas.Rocket engines are reaction engines, producing thrust by ejecting mass rearward, in accordance with Newton's third law.Most rocket engines use the combustion of reactive chemicals to supply the necessary energy, but non-combusting forms such as cold gas thrusters and nuclear thermal rockets also exist.Vehicles propelled by rocket engines are commonly called rockets.Rocket vehicles carry their own oxidiser, unlike most combustion engines, so rocket engines can be used in a vacuum to propel spacecraft and ballistic missiles..Compared to other types of jet engine, rocket engines are the lightest and have the highest thrust, but are the least propellant-efficient (they have the lowest specific impulse).The ideal exhaust is hydrogen, the lightest of all elements, but chemical rockets produce a mix of heavier species, reducing the exhaust velocity..Rocket engines become more efficient at high speeds, due to the Oberth effect.[1].Here, \"rocket\" is used as an abbreviation for \"rocket engine\"..Thermal rockets use an inert propellant, heated by electricity (electrothermal propulsion) or a nuclear reactor (nuclear thermal rocket)..Chemical rockets are powered by exothermic reduction-oxidation chemical reactions of the propellant:.Rocket engines produce thrust by the expulsion of an exhaust fluid that has been accelerated to high speed through a propelling nozzle.", "...Baby One More Time": "\"...Baby One More Time\" is the debut single of American singer Britney Spears from her debut studio album of the same title (1999).It was written by Max Martin and produced by Martin and Rami.Released on September 29, 1998, by Jive Records, the song became a worldwide hit, topping the charts in at least 23 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it earned triple-platinum certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and was the country's best-selling single of 1999.The song is one of the best-selling singles of all time, with over 10 million copies sold..An accompanying music video, directed by Nigel Dick, features Spears as a high-school student who starts to sing and dance around the school, while watching her love interest from afar.In 2010, the music video for \"...Baby One More Time\" was voted the third most influential video in the history of pop music, in a poll held by Jam!.In 2011, \"...Baby One More Time\" was voted by Billboard to be the best music video of the 1990s.It has been featured on all of her greatest hits and other compilation albums.In 2020, Rolling Stone named \"...Baby One More Time\" as the greatest debut single of all time.[1] In 2021, the song was ranked at number 205 on the list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time..Spears has performed \"...Baby One More Time\" in a number of live appearances and during all of her concert tours.The song was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards (2000), and has been included in lists by Blender, Rolling Stone and VH1.It has been noted for redefining the sound of late 1990s music.", "Cholera": "Cholera (/\u02c8k\u0252l\u0259r\u0259/) is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.[4][3] Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe.[3] The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea lasting a few days.[2] Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur.[3] Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.[2] This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet.[5] Dehydration can cause the skin to turn bluish.[8] Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.[3].Cholera is caused by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, with some types producing more severe disease than others.[2] It is spread mostly by unsafe water and unsafe food that has been contaminated with human feces containing the bacteria.[2] Undercooked shellfish is a common source.[9] Humans are the only known host for the bacteria.[2] Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, insufficient clean drinking water, and poverty.[2] Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test,[2] or a rapid dipstick test, although the dipstick test is less accurate.[10].Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water.[5] Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months, and confer the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by E.coli.[2] In 2017 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a single-dose, live, oral cholera vaccine called Vaxchora for adults aged 18\u201364 who are travelling to an area of active cholera transmission.[11] It offers limited protection to young children.People who survive an episode of cholera have long-lasting immunity for at least 3 years (the period tested.)[12].The primary treatment for affected individuals is oral rehydration salts (ORS), the replacement of fluids and electrolytes by using slightly sweet and salty solutions.[2] Rice-based solutions are preferred.[2] In children, Zinc supplementation has also been found to improve outcomes.[6] In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as Ringer's lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial.[2] The choice of antibiotic is aided by antibiotic sensitivity testing.[3].Cholera continues to affect an estimated 3\u20135million people worldwide and causes 28,800\u2013130,000deaths a year.[2][7] To date, seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the developing world, with the most recent beginning in 1961, and continuing today.[13] The illness is rare in high-income countries, and affects children most severely.[2][14] Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas.[2] Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and Southeast Asia.[2] The risk of death among those affected is usually less than 5%, given improved treatment, but may be as high as 50% without such access to treatment.[2] Descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC in Sanskrit.[5] In Europe, cholera was a term initially used to describe any kind of gastroenteritis, and was not used for this disease until the early 19th century.[15] The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology because of his insights about transmission via contaminated water, and a map of the same was the first recorded incidence of epidemiological tracking.[5][16].The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid.[17] These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria.[18] The diarrhea is frequently described as \"rice water\" in nature and may have a fishy odor.[17] An untreated person with cholera may produce 10 to 20 litres (3 to 5USgal) of diarrhea a day.[17] Severe cholera, without treatment, kills about half of affected individuals.[17] If the severe diarrhea is not treated, it can result in life-threatening dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.[17] Estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100.[19] Cholera has been nicknamed the \"blue death\"[20] because a person's skin may turn bluish-gray from extreme loss of fluids.[21].Fever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection.Patients can be lethargic and might have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, or wrinkled hands and feet.Kussmaul breathing, a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of acidosis from stool bicarbonate losses and lactic acidosis associated with poor perfusion.Blood pressure drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time.Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, seizures, or even coma due to electrolyte imbalances are common, especially in children.[17].", "The Picture of Dorian Gray": "The Picture of Dorian Gray is a philosophical novel by Irish writer Oscar Wilde.A shorter novella-length version was published in the July 1890 issue of the American periodical Lippincott's Monthly Magazine.[1][2] The novel-length version was published in April 1891..The story revolves around a portrait of Dorian Gray painted by Basil Hallward, a friend of Dorian's and an artist infatuated with Dorian's beauty.Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton and is soon enthralled by the aristocrat's hedonistic worldview: that beauty and sensual fulfillment are the only things worth pursuing in life.Newly understanding that his beauty will fade, Dorian expresses the desire to sell his soul, to ensure that the picture, rather than he, will age and fade.The wish is granted, and Dorian pursues a libertine life of varied amoral experiences while staying young and beautiful; all the

sisters were actresses Eva and Magda Gabor..Gabor competed in the 1933 Miss Hungary pageant, where she placed as second runner-up, and began her stage career in Vienna the following year.[1] She emigrated from Hungary to the United States in 1941.Becoming a sought-after actress with \"European flair and style\", she was considered to have a personality that \"exuded charm and grace\".[2] Her first film role was a supporting role in Lovely to Look At (1952).She later acted in We're Not Married! (1952) and played one of her few leading roles in the John Huston-directed film Moulin Rouge (1952).Huston would later describe her as a \"creditable\" actress.[3].Outside her acting career, Gabor was known for her extravagant Hollywood lifestyle, her glamorous personality, and her many marriages.In total, Gabor had nine husbands, including hotel magnate Conrad Hilton and actor George Sanders.She once stated, \"Men have always liked me and I have always liked men.But I like a mannish man, a man who knows how to talk to and treat a woman\u2014not just a man with muscles.\"[4].Zsa Zsa Gabor was born S\u00e1ri G\u00e1bor on February 6, 1917,[a] in Budapest, Hungary, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[6] The middle of three daughters, her parents were Jolie (n\u00e9e Janszieka Tillemann) and Vilmos G\u00e1bor (n\u00e9 Gr\u00fcn),[7][8] owner of a prominent jewelry[9] store in Budapest,[10] a Royal Hungarian Army officer.[11][12] Her parents were both of Jewish ancestry.On 8 July 1944,[13] her parents were both in Budapest at their home (simultaneously the Portuguese Embassy)[14][10] and escaped Hungary during the period of the Nazi occupation of Budapest, aided by Gabor's husband, Conrad N.", "Bruce Lee": "Bruce Lee (Chinese: \u674e\u5c0f\u9f8d; born Lee Jun-fan, \u674e\u632f\u85e9; November 27, 1940 \u2013 July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong-American martial artist and actor whose career spanned Hong Kong and the United States.[3][4][5] He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is sometimes credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts (MMA).[6] Lee is considered by some commentators and martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West.He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and helping to change the way Chinese people were presented in American films.[7].Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a child actor by his father.However, these were not martial arts films.His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Yip Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and apparently frequent street fighting (neighbourhood and rooftop fights).In 1959, Lee moved to Seattle.In 1961, he enrolled in the University of Washington.[8] It was during this time in the United States that he began considering making money by teaching martial arts, even though he aspired to have a career in acting.He opened his first martial arts school, operated out of home in Seattle.After later adding a second school in Oakland, California, he once drew significant attention at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships of California by making demonstrations and speaking.He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to teach, where his students included Chuck Norris, Sharon Tate, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.In the 1970s, his Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the Hong Kong martial arts films to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of Western interest in Chinese martial arts.The direction and tone of his films dramatically influenced and changed martial arts and martial arts films worldwide.[9].", "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of progressive lung disease characterized by long-term respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation.[8] The main symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath and a cough, which may or may not produce mucus.[4] COPD progressively worsens, with everyday activities such as walking or dressing becoming difficult.[3] While COPD is incurable, it is preventable and treatable.The two most common types of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis and have been the two classic COPD phenotypes.[9] Emphysema is defined as enlarged airspaces (alveoli) whose walls have broken down resulting in permanent damage to the lung tissue.Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years.Both of these conditions can exist without airflow limitation when they are not classed as COPD.Emphysema is just one of the structural abnormalities that can limit airflow and can exist without airflow limitation in a significant number of people.[10][11] Chronic bronchitis does not always result in airflow limitation but in young adults who smoke the risk of developing COPD is high.[12] Many definitions of COPD in the past included emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but these have never been included in GOLD report definitions.[8] Emphysema and chronic bronchitis remain the predominant phenotypes of COPD but there is often overlap between them and a number of other phenotypes have also been described.[9][13] COPD and asthma may coexist and converge in some individuals.[14] COPD is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation.[15].The most common cause of COPD is tobacco smoking.[16] Other risk factors include indoor and outdoor air pollution including dust, exposure to occupational irritants such as dust from grains, cadmium dust or fumes, and genetics, such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.[12][17] In developing countries, common sources of indoor air pollution are the use of coal and biomass such as wood and dry dung as fuel for cooking and heating.[18][12] The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by spirometry.[4].Most cases of COPD can be prevented by reducing exposure to risk factors such as smoking and indoor and outdoor pollutants.[19] While treatment can slow worsening, there is no conclusive evidence that any medications can change the long-term decline in lung function.[6] COPD treatments include smoking cessation, vaccinations, pulmonary rehabilitation, inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids.[6] Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy, lung volume reduction and lung transplantation.[20] In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications, antibiotics, corticosteroids and hospitalization may be needed.[21].As of 2015, COPD affected about 174.5million people (2.4% of the global population).[7] It typically occurs in males and females over the age of 35\u201340.[1][3] In 2019 it caused 3.2million deaths, 80% occurring in lower and middle income countries,[3] up from 2.4million deaths in 1990.[22][23] The number of deaths is projected to increase further because of continued exposure to risk factors and an aging population.[8] In the United States in 2010 the economic cost was put at US$32.1billion and projected to rise to US$49billion in 2020.[24] In the United Kingdom this cost is estimated at \u00a33.8 billion annually.[25].A cardinal symptom of COPD is the chronic and progressive shortness of breath which is most characteristic of the condition.Shortness of breath (breathlessness) is often the most distressing symptom responsible for the associated anxiety and level of disability experienced.[4] Symptoms of wheezing and chest tightness associated with breathlessness can be variable over the course of a day or between days and are not always present.Chest tightness often follows exertion.[4] Many people with more advanced COPD breathe through pursed lips, which can improve shortness of breath.[26] Shortness of breath is often responsible for reduced physical activity and low levels of physical activity are associated with worse outcomes.[27][28] In severe and very severe cases there may be constant tiredness, weight loss, muscle loss and anorexia.People with COPD often have increased breathlessness and frequent colds before seeking treatment.[4].", "Anne Frank": "Annelies Marie Frank (German: [\u02c8an\u0259(li\u02d0s ma\u02c8\u0281i\u02d0)

March 1945)[1] was a German-born Jewish girl who kept a diary in which she documented life in hiding under Nazi persecution.She is a celebrated diarist who described everyday life from her family hiding place in an Amsterdam attic.One of the most-discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust, she gained fame posthumously with the 1947 publication of The Diary of a Young Girl (originally Het Achterhuis in Dutch, lit.\u2009'the back house'; English: The Secret Annex), in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II.It is one of the world's best-known books and has been the basis for several plays and films..Anne was born in Frankfurt, Germany.In 1934, when she was four and a half, her family moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands, after Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party gained control over Germany.She spent most of her life in or around Amsterdam.By May 1940, the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands.Anne lost her German citizenship in 1941 and became stateless.As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942, they went into hiding in concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father, Otto Frank, worked.Until the family's arrest by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944, Anne kept a diary she had received as a birthday present, and wrote in it regularly..Following their arrest, the Franks were transported to concentration camps.", "Kurt Cobain": "Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 \u2013 c.April 5, 1994) was an American musician who was the co-founder, lead vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter of the rock band Nirvana.Through his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain's compositions widened the thematic conventions of mainstream rock.He was heralded as a spokesman of Generation X and is highly recognized as one of the most influential alternative rock musicians..Cobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene that later became known as grunge.After signing with DGC Records, Nirvana found commercial success with the single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" from their critically acclaimed second album Nevermind (1991).Although Cobain was hailed as the voice of his generation following Nirvana's sudden success, he resented this, believing his message and artistic vision had been misinterpreted by the public.In addition to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", Cobain wrote many other hit songs for Nirvana, including \"Come as You Are\", \"Lithium\", \"In Bloom\", \"Something in the Way\", \"Heart-Shaped Box\", \"All Apologies\", \"About a Girl\", \"Aneurysm\",[1] and \"You Know You're Right\".[2].During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with a heroin addiction and chronic health problems such as depression.[3] He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame, and he had a tumultuous relationship with his wife, fellow musician Courtney Love.[4] In March 1994, Cobain overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol, and he subsequently entered an intervention and underwent a detox program.On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home at the age of 27;[5] police concluded he had died on April 5 from a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head..Cobain was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl, in their first year of eligibility in 2014.Rolling Stone included Cobain in its lists of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, 100 Greatest Guitarists, and 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.[6] He was ranked 7th by MTV in the \"22 Greatest Voices in Music\".", "Radial engine": "The radial engine is a reciprocating type internal combustion engine configuration in which the cylinders \"radiate\" outward from a central crankcase like the spokes of a wheel.It resembles a stylized star when viewed from the front, and is called a \"star engine\" in some other languages..The radial configuration was commonly used for aircraft engines before gas turbine engines became predominant..Since the axes of the cylinders are coplanar, the connecting rods cannot all be directly attached to the crankshaft unless mechanically complex forked connecting rods are used, none of which have been successful.Instead, the pistons are connected to the crankshaft with a master-and-articulating-rod assembly.One piston, the uppermost one in the animation, has a master rod with a direct attachment to the crankshaft.The remaining pistons pin their connecting rods' attachments to rings around the edge of the master rod.Extra \"rows\" of radial cylinders can be added in order to increase the capacity of the engine without adding to its diameter..Four-stroke radials have an odd number of cylinders per row, so that a consistent every-other-piston firing order can be maintained, providing smooth operation.For example, on a five-cylinder engine the firing order is 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, and back to cylinder 1.Moreover, this always leaves a one-piston gap between the piston on its combustion stroke and the piston on compression.The active stroke directly helps compress the next cylinder to fire, making the motion more uniform.", "The Golden Girls": "The Golden Girls is an American sitcom created by Susan Harris that aired on NBC from September 14, 1985, to May 9, 1992, with a total of 180 half-hour episodes, spanning seven seasons.With an ensemble cast starring Bea Arthur, Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty, the show is about four older women who share a home in Miami, Florida.It was produced by Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions, in association with Touchstone Television.Paul Junger Witt, Tony Thomas, and Harris served as the original executive producers..The Golden Girls received critical acclaim throughout most of its run, and won several awards, including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series twice.It also won three Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy.[2] Each of the four stars received an Emmy Award, making it one of only four sitcoms in the award's history to achieve this.The series also ranked among the Nielsen ratings' top ten for six of its seven seasons.[3] In 2013, TV Guide ranked The Golden Girls number 54 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.[4] In 2014, the Writers Guild of America placed the sitcom at number 69 in their list of the \"101 Best Written TV Series of All Time\".[5] Terry Tang of the Associated Press reported that the series continues to attract new fans in the 21st century and characterized it as an example of a sitcom that has aged well.[6].The show, featuring an ensemble cast, revolves around four older single women (three widows and one divorc\u00e9e) sharing a house in Miami.The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (White) and divorc\u00e9e Dorothy Zbornak (Arthur) after they both responded to an ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store a year before the start of the series.In the pilot episode, the three are joined by Dorothy's 80-year-old widowed mother, Sophia Petrillo (Getty), after the retirement home where she has been living has burned down.[7][8].The first episode features a cook/butler named Coco (played by Charles Levin), but the role was dropped before the second episode.The writers observed that in many of the proposed scripts, the main interaction between the women occurred in the kitchen while preparing and eating food.", "Deepwater drilling": "Deepwater drilling,[1] or deep well drilling,[2] is the process of creating holes in the Earth's crust using a drilling rig for oil extraction under the deep sea.There are approximately 3400 deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico with depths greater than 150 meters.[3][full citation needed].Deepwater drilling has not been technologically or economically feasible for many years, but with rising oil prices,[when?] more companies are investing in this sector.[4] Major investors include Halliburton, Diamond Offshore, Transocean, Geoservices, and Schlumberger.The deepwater gas and oil market has been back on the rise since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, with total expenditures of around US$35 billion per year in the market and total global capital expenditures of US$167 billion in the past four years.[5] Industry analysis by business intelligence company Visiongain estimated in 2011 that total expenditures in global deepwater infrastructure would reach US$145 billion.[6].A HowStuffWorks article explains how and why deepwater drilling is practiced:.Not all oil is accessible on land or in shallow water.You can find some oil deposits buried deep under the ocean floor....Using sonic equipment, oil companies determine the drilling sites most likely to produce oil.Then they use a mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) to dig the initial well.Some units are converted into production rigs, meaning they switch from drilling for oil to capturing oil once it's found.Most of the time, the oil company will replace the MODU with a more permanent oil production rig to capture oil.", "Monica Lewinsky": "Monica Samille Lewinsky (born July 23, 1973)[1] is an American activist and writer.A former White House intern, Lewinsky gained international celebrity status in the late 1990s as a result of the public coverage of a political scandal when U.S.President Bill Clinton admitted to having an affair with her during her days as an intern between 1995 and 1997.The affair, and its repercussions (which included Clinton's impeachment), became known later as the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal..She subsequently engaged in a variety of ventures that included designing a line of handbags under her name, serving as an advertising spokesperson for a diet plan, and working as a television personality.Lewinsky left the public spotlight in the mid-2000s to pursue a master's degree in psychology in London.In 2014, she returned to public view as a social activist speaking out against cyberbullying, based on her experiences dealing with the media coverage regarding the scandal..Lewinsky was born in San Francisco, California, and grew up in an affluent family in Southern California in the Westside Brentwood area of Los Angeles and later in Beverly Hills.[2][3][1][4] Her father is Bernard Lewinsky, an oncologist, who is the son of German Jews who escaped from Nazi Germany, first moving to El Salvador and then finally to the United States when he was 14.[3][5] Her mother, born Marcia Kay Vilensky, is an author who uses the name Marcia Lewis.In 1996, she wrote a \"gossip biography\", The Private Lives of the Three Tenors.Lewinsky\u2019s maternal grandfather, Samuel M.Vilensky, was a Lithuanian Jew, and her maternal grandmother, Bronia Poleshuk, was born in the British Concession of Tianjin, China, to a Russian Jewish family.[6][7] Lewinsky\u2019s parents divorced in 1988 and each has remarried.[8][4][3].The family attended Sinai Temple in Los Angeles and Lewinsky attended Sinai Akiba Academy, the school affiliated with the Temple.[4] For her primary education, she attended the John Thomas Dye School in Bel-Air.[9] Lewinsky attended Beverly Hills High School for three years before transferring to Bel Air Prep (later

singer and actor.Nicknamed the \"Chairman of the Board\" and later called \"Ol' Blue Eyes\", he is regarded as one of the most popular entertainers of the mid-20th century.Sinatra is among the world's best-selling music artists with an estimated 150 million record sales.[2][3].Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era and was greatly influenced by the easy-listening vocal style of Bing Crosby.[4] He found success as a solo artist after signing with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\".In 1946, Sinatra released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra.He then signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums.In 1960, Sinatra left Capitol Records to start his own record label, Reprise Records, releasing a string of successful albums.In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album September of My Years and starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music.After releasing Sinatra at the Sands in early 1966, Sinatra recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim.It was followed by 1968's Francis A.& Edward K.with Duke Ellington.", "Cornhole": "Cornhole (also known regionally as sack toss, or bags) is a lawn game popular in North America in which players or teams take turns throwing fabric bean bags at a raised, angled board with a hole in its far end.The goal of the game is to score points by either landing a bag on the board (one point) or putting a bag through the hole (three points)..The game was first described in Heyliger de Windt's 1883 patent for \"Parlor Quoits\", which displays most of the features of modern cornhole, but uses a square hole.[1] Quoits is a game similar to horseshoes, played by throwing steel rings at a metal spike.Several earlier \"parlor quoits\" patents had sought to recreate quoit gameplay in an indoor environment,[2] but De Windt's was the first to use bean bags and a slanted board with a hole as the target..He sold the rights to the game to a Massachusetts toy manufacturer which marketed a version of it under the name \"Faba Baga\".[2] Unlike modern cornhole, which has one hole and one size of bags, a Faba Baga board had two different-sized holes, worth different point values, and provided each player with one extra-large bag per round, which could score double points..In September 1974, Popular Mechanics magazine published an article written by Carolyn Farrell about a similar game called \"bean-bag bull's-eye.\"[3] Bean-bag bull's-eye was played on a board the same width of modern cornhole boards (24\"), but only 36\" long as opposed to the 48\" length used in cornhole.The hole was the same diameter (6\") but was centered 8\" (rather than 9\") from the back of the board.Each player threw two bags, weighing eight ounces each, \"in succession\".The boards in bean-bag bull's-eye were placed \"about 30 ft.apart for adults, 10 ft.for kids.\" Scoring was essentially the same as that used in cornhole (three points for a bag in the hole, one point for a bag remaining on the board) and also used cancellation scoring..In the Chicago area, a similar game is referred to as \"bags\", but uses rectangular bags.", "American Gold Eagle": "The American Gold Eagle is an official gold bullion coin of the United States.Authorized under the Gold Bullion Coin Act of 1985, it was first released by the United States Mint in 1986.Because the term \"eagle\" also is the official United States designation for pre-1933 ten dollars gold coins, the weight of the bullion coin is typically used when describing American Gold Eagles (e.g., \"1/2-ounce American Gold Eagle\") to avoid confusion.This is particularly true with the 1/4-oz American Gold Eagle, which has a marked face value of ten dollars..Offered in 1/10 oz, 1/4 oz, 1/2 oz, and 1 oz denominations, these coins are guaranteed by the U.S.government to contain the stated amount of actual gold weight in troy ounces.By law, the gold must come from sources in the United States, alloyed with silver and copper to produce a more wear-resistant coin.In addition, sales of these and other specie coins from the US Mint are mandated, at least in part, to pay off the national debt.[1].The 22 kt gold alloy is an English standard traditionally referred to as \"crown gold\".Crown gold alloys had not been used in U.S.coins since 1834, with the gold content having dropped since 1837 to a standard of 0.900 fine for U.S.gold coins.", "Bikram Yoga": "Bikram Yoga is a system of hot yoga, a type of yoga as exercise, devised by Bikram Choudhury and based on the teachings of B.C.Ghosh, that became popular in the early 1970s.[1] Classes consist of a fixed sequence of 26 postures, practised in a room heated to 105\u00b0F (41\u00b0C) with a humidity of 40%, intended to replicate the climate of India.The room is fitted with carpets and the walls are covered in mirrors.The instructor may adjust the students' yoga postures.Choudhury's teaching style was abrasive.[2].Bikram Yoga spread rapidly across America and the Western world, reaching a peak of some 1,650 studios in at least 40 countries in 2006.Choudhury attempted to copyright the Bikram Yoga sequence from 2011, but was ultimately unsuccessful.In 2016, facing lawsuits and accusations of sexual assault, Choudhury fled to India, leaving Bikram Yoga, Inc.to be run by others.[3].Bikram Choudhury was born in Calcutta in 1944.He began studying yoga in 1969.[4] He arrived in America in 1971, and soon began to teach yoga in health resorts in California.[5] In 1974, two pupils, Shirley MacLaine and Anne Marie Bennstrom, helped him to open his own school at 9441 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.[5] He attracted celebrity pupils including the Hollywood dancer Marge Champion and the actors Keir Dullea, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon, and Raquel

or as a tool for measuring volume.[1][2] The size of teaspoons ranges from about 2.5 to 7.3mL (0.088 to 0.257impfloz; 0.085 to 0.247USfloz).For cooking purposes and dosing of medicine, a teaspoonful is defined as 5mL (0.18impfloz; 0.17USfloz), and standard measuring spoons are used.[3].A teaspoon is a small spoon suitable for stirring and sipping the contents of a cup of tea or coffee, or adding a portion of loose sugar to it.These spoons have heads more or less oval in shape.Teaspoons are a common part of a place setting..Teaspoons with longer handles, such as iced tea spoons, are commonly used also for ice cream desserts or floats.Similar spoons include the tablespoon and the dessert spoon, the latter intermediate in size between a teaspoon and a tablespoon, used in eating dessert and sometimes soup or cereals.Much less common is the coffee spoon, which is a smaller version of the teaspoon, intended for use with the small type of coffee cup.[4] Another teaspoon, called an orange spoon (in American English: grapefruit spoon), tapers to a sharp point or teeth, and is used to separate citrus fruits from their membranes.A bar spoon, equivalent to a teaspoon, is used in measuring ingredients for mixed drinks..A container designed to hold extra teaspoons, called a spooner, usually in a set with a covered sugar container, formed a part of Victorian table service..Teaspoon is a European invention.[5] Small spoons were common in Europe since at least the 13th century, the special spoons were introduced almost simultaneously with the tea and coffee[5] (Pettigrew points to use in the mid-17th century[6]).", "Fern": "The ferns (Polypodiopsida or Polypodiophyta) are a group of vascular plants (plants with xylem and phloem) that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers.They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having specialized tissues that conduct water and nutrients and in having life cycles in which the branched sporophyte is the dominant phase..Ferns have complex leaves called megaphylls, that are more complex than the microphylls of clubmosses.Most ferns are leptosporangiate ferns.They produce coiled fiddleheads that uncoil and expand into fronds.The group includes about 10,560 known extant species.Ferns are defined here in the broad sense, being all of the Polypodiopsida, comprising both the leptosporangiate (Polypodiidae) and eusporangiate ferns, the latter group including horsetails, whisk ferns, marattioid ferns, and ophioglossoid ferns..Ferns first appear in the fossil record about 360 million years ago in the late Devonian period, but Polypodiales, the group that makes up 80% of living fern diversity, did not appear and diversify until the Cretaceous, contemporaneous with the rise of flowering plants that came to dominate the world's flora..Ferns are not of major economic importance, but some are used for food, medicine, as biofertilizer, as ornamental plants, and for remediating contaminated soil.They have been the subject of research for their ability to remove some chemical pollutants from the atmosphere.Some fern species, such as bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and water fern (Azolla filiculoides), are significant weeds worldwide.Some fern genera, such as Azolla, can fix nitrogen and make a significant input to the nitrogen nutrition of rice paddies.", "Flat roof": "A flat roof is a roof which is almost level in contrast to the many types of sloped roofs.The slope of a roof is properly known as its pitch and flat roofs have up to approximately 10\u00b0..[1] Flat roofs are an ancient form mostly used in arid climates and allow the roof space to be used as a living space or a living roof.Flat roofs, or \"low-slope\" roofs, are also commonly found on commercial buildings throughout the world.The U.S.-based National Roofing Contractors Association defines a low-slope roof as having a slope of 3 in 12 (1:4) or less.[2].Flat roofs exist all over the world, and each area has its own tradition or preference for materials used.In warmer climates, where there is less rainfall and freezing is unlikely to occur, many flat roofs are simply built of masonry or concrete and this is good at keeping out the heat of the sun and cheap and easy to build where timber is not readily available.In areas where the roof could become saturated by rain and leak, or where water soaked into the brickwork could freeze to ice and thus lead to 'blowing' (breaking up of the mortar/brickwork/concrete by the expansion of ice as it forms) these roofs are not suitable.Flat roofs are characteristic of the Egyptian, Persian, and Arabian styles of architecture.[3].Around the world, many modern commercial buildings have flat roofs.The roofs are usually clad with a deeper profile roof sheet (usually 40mm deep or greater).This gives the roof sheet very high water carrying capacity and allows the roof sheets to be more than 100 metres long in some cases.", "CD-ROM": "A CD-ROM (/\u02ccsi\u02d0di\u02d0\u02c8r\u0252m/, compact disc read-only memory) is a type of read-only memory consisting of a pre-pressed optical compact disc that contains data.Computers can read\u2014but not write or erase\u2014CD-ROMs.Some CDs, called enhanced CDs, hold both computer data and audio with the latter capable of being played on a CD player, while data (such as software or digital video) is only usable on a computer (such as ISO 9660[2] format PC CD-ROMs)..During the 1990s and early 2000s, CD-ROMs were popularly used to distribute software and data for computers and fifth generation video game consoles.DVD started to replace it in these roles starting in the early 2000s..The earliest theoretical work on optical disc storage was done by independent researchers in the United States including David Paul Gregg (1958) and James Russel (1965\u20131975).In particular, Gregg's patents were used as the basis of the LaserDisc specification that was co-developed between MCA and Philips after MCA purchased Gregg's patents, as well as the company he founded, Gauss Electrophysics.[3] The LaserDisc was the immediate precursor to the CD, with the primary difference being that the LaserDisc encoded information through an analog process whereas the CD used digital encoding..Key work to digitize the optical disc was performed by Toshi Doi and Kees Schouhamer Immink during 1979\u20131980, who worked on a taskforce for Sony and Philips.[4] The result was the Compact Disc Digital Audio (CD-DA), defined on 1980.The CD-ROM was later designed as an extension of the CD-DA, and adapted this format to hold any form of digital data, with an initial storage capacity of 553 MB.[5] Sony and Philips created the technical standard that defines the format of a CD-ROM in 1983,[6] in what came to be called the Yellow Book.The CD-ROM was announced in 1984[7] and introduced by Denon and Sony at the first Japanese COMDEX computer show in 1985.[8] In November, 1985, several computer industry participants including Microsoft, Philips, Sony, Apple and Digital Equipment Corporation met to create a specification to define a file system format for CD-ROMs.[9] The resulting specification, called the High Sierra format, was published in May 1986.[9] It was eventually standardized, with a few changes, as the ISO 9660 standard in 1988.One of the first products to be made available to the public on CD-ROM was the Grolier Academic Encyclopedia, presented at the Microsoft CD-ROM Conference in March 1986.[9].CD-ROMs began being used in home video game consoles starting with the PC Engine CD-ROM\u00b2 (TurboGrafx-CD) in 1988, while CD-ROM drives had also become available for home computers by the end of the 1980s.", "J.

Harry Potter, a seven-volume fantasy series published from 1997 to 2007.The series has sold over 600million copies, been translated into 84languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video games.The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults.She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, under the alias Robert Galbraith..Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London.The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997.Six sequels followed, and by 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author..Rowling concluded the Harry Potter series with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007).The novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts (a school for wizards), and battles Lord Voldemort.Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series.", "Auburndale, Florida": "Auburndale is a city in Polk County, Florida, United States.The population was 15,616 at the 2020 census.[6] It is part of the Lakeland-Winter Haven, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area..Auburndale was founded in 1880 by Frank Fuller, who was seeking refuge from chilly winters in the Northeast United States.[7] The place was originally named Sanatoria, from a hotel located there.When the railroad arrived in the 1880s, the town was renamed Auburndale at the suggestion of settlers from Auburndale, Massachusetts.[8] The New England town had been named from the opening line of the poem \"The Deserted Village\" by Oliver Goldsmith.[9].Early on, the city became a chosen destination for a number of America's most prominent artists.[7].The city is located 40 miles (64km) northeast of Tampa[10] and 59 miles (95km) southwest of Orlando.[10] Auburndale is located within the Central Florida Highlands area of the Atlantic coastal plain with a terrain consisting of flatland interspersed with gently rolling hills.[11].According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.3 square miles (24km2), of which 5.2 square miles (13km2) is land and 4.1 square miles (11km2) (43.87%) is water..Auburndale is located in the humid subtropical zone, as designated by (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa).[12].The city commission is made up of five commissioners elected from single-member districts.The mayor is elected from the commissioners by the voters.[13] The city budget is $69 million.[13].As of the census[5] of 2000, there were 11,032 people, 4,119 households, and 3,002 families residing in the city.The population density was 2,113.5 inhabitants per square mile (816.0/km2).", "Tropical cyclone": "A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain and squalls.Depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names, including hurricane (/\u02c8h\u028cr\u026ak\u0259n, -ke\u026an/), typhoon (/ta\u026a\u02c8fu\u02d0n/), tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, or simply cyclone.A hurricane is a strong tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean or northeastern Pacific Ocean, and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.In the Indian Ocean and South Pacific, comparable storms are referred to as \"tropical cyclones\", and such storms in the Indian Ocean can also be called \"severe cyclonic storms\"..\"Tropical\" refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively over tropical seas.\"Cyclone\" refers to their winds moving in a circle, whirling round their central clear eye, with their surface winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect.Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water.They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface, which ultimately condenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation.This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms, such as nor'easters and European windstorms, which are powered primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts.Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000km (62 and 1,243mi) in diameter.Every year tropical cyclones affect various regions of the globe including the Gulf Coast of North America, Australia, India, and Bangladesh..", "Kirk Douglas": "Kirk Douglas (born Issur Danielovitch; December 9, 1916 \u2013 February 5, 2020) was an American actor and filmmaker.After an impoverished childhood, he made his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck.Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war films.During his career, he appeared in more than 90 films and was known for his explosive acting style.He was named by the American Film Institute the 17th-greatest male star of Classic Hollywood cinema..Douglas played an unscrupulous boxing hero in Champion (1949), which brought him his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.His other early films include Out of the Past (1947); Young Man with a Horn (1950), playing opposite Lauren Bacall and Doris Day; Ace in the Hole (1951); and Detective Story (1951), for which he received a Golden Globe nomination.He received his second Oscar nomination for his dramatic role in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), opposite Lana Turner, and earned his third for portraying Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956), a role for which he won the Golden Globe for the Best Actor in a Drama.He also starred with James Mason in the adventure 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), a large box-office hit..In September 1949, he established Bryna Productions, which began producing films as varied as Paths of Glory (1957) and Spartacus (1960).In those two films, he collaborated with the then relatively unknown director Stanley Kubrick, taking lead roles in both films.Douglas helped to break the Hollywood blacklist by having Dalton Trumbo write Spartacus with an official on-screen credit.[1] He produced and starred in Lonely Are the Brave (1962) and Seven Days in May (1964), the latter opposite Burt Lancaster, with whom he made seven films.", "Bob Seger": "Robert Clark Seger (/\u02c8si\u02d0\u0261\u0259r/ SEE-g\u0259r; born May 6, 1945) is a retired American singer, songwriter, and musician.As a locally successful Detroit-area artist, he performed and recorded as Bob Seger and the Last Heard and the Bob Seger System throughout the 1960s, breaking through with his first album, Ramblin' Gamblin' Man (which contained his first national hit of the same name) in 1969.By the early 1970s, he had dropped the 'System' from his recordings and continued to strive for broader success with various other bands.In 1973, he put together the Silver Bullet Band, with a group of Detroit-area musicians, with whom he became most successful on the national level with the album Live Bullet (1976), recorded live with the Silver Bullet Band in 1975 at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan.In 1976, he achieved a national breakout with the studio album Night Moves.On his studio albums, he also worked extensively with the Alabama-based Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, which appeared on several of Seger's best-selling singles and albums..A roots rocker with a classic raspy, powerful voice, Seger wrote and recorded songs that dealt with love, women, and blue-collar themes, and is one of the best-known examples of a heartland rock artist.He has recorded many hits, including \"Night Moves\", \"Turn the Page\", \"Mainstreet\", \"Still the Same\", \"Hollywood Nights\", \"Against the Wind\", \"You'll Accomp'ny Me\", \"Shame on the Moon\", \"Roll Me Away\", \"Like a Rock\", and \"Shakedown\", the last of which was written for the 1987 film Beverly Hills Cop II and topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart.He also co-wrote the Eagles' number-one hit \"Heartache Tonight\", and his recording of \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" was named one of the Songs of the Century in 2001..With a career spanning six decades, Seger has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling artists of all time.[1] Seger was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012.[2][3][4][5] Seger was named Billboard's 2015 Legend of Live honoree at the 12th annual Billboard Touring Conference & Awards, held November 18\u201319 at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York.His farewell tour took place in 2018 and 2019.[6].Seger was born at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan,[7] the son of Charlotte and Stewart Seger.", "Richard Nixon": "Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913\u2013 April 22, 1994) was the 37th president of the United States, serving from 1969 to 1974.A lawyer and member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a representative and senator from California and was the 36th vice president from 1953 to 1961 under President Dwight D.Eisenhower.His five years in the White House saw reduction of U.S.involvement in the Vietnam War, d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union and China, the Apollo 11 Moon landing, and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration.Nixon's second term ended early when he became the only U.S.president to resign from office, as a result of the Watergate scandal..Nixon was born into a poor family of Quakers in a small town in Southern California.He graduated from Duke Law School in 1937, practiced law in California, and then moved with his wife Pat to Washington, DC in 1942 to work for the federal government.After active duty in the Naval Reserve during World War II, he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946.His work on the Alger Hiss case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist, which elevated him to national prominence, and in 1950, he was elected to the Senate.Nixon was the running mate of Dwight D.", "Charles Sumner": "Charles Sumner (January 6, 1811\u2013 March 11, 1874) was an American lawyer, politician, and statesman who represented Massachusetts in the United States Senate from 1851 until his death in 1874.Before and during the American Civil War, he was a leading American advocate for the abolition of slavery.He chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1861 to 1871, until he lost the position following a dispute with President Ulysses S.Grant over the attempted annexation of Santo Domingo.After breaking with Grant, he joined the Liberal Republican Party.He spent his final two years in the Senate alienated from his party.Sumner had a controversial and divisive legacy for many years after his death, but in recent decades, his historical reputation has improved in recognition of his early support for racial equality..Sumner began his political activism as a member of various anti-slavery groups, leading to his election to the U.S.Senate in 1851 as a member of the Free Soil Party; he soon became a founding member of the Republican Party.In the Senate, he devoted his efforts to opposing the \"Slave Power,\"[1] which culminated in a vicious beating by Representative Preston Brooks on the Senate floor in 1856; Sumner's severe injuries and extended absence from the Senate made him a symbol of the anti-slavery cause.Though he did not return to the Senate until 1859, Massachusetts reelected him in 1857, leaving his empty desk as a reminder of the incident, which polarized the nation as the Civil War approached..During the war, Sumner led the Radical Republican faction critical of President Abraham Lincoln for being too moderate toward the South.", "Business ethics": "Business ethics (also known as corporate ethics) is a form of applied ethics or professional ethics, that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that can arise in a business environment.It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.[1] These ethics originate from individuals, organizational statements or the legal system.These norms, values, ethical, and unethical practices are the principles that guide a business.[2].Business ethics refers to contemporary organizational standards, principles, sets of values and norms that govern the actions and behavior of an individual in the business organization.Business ethics have two dimensions, normative business ethics or descriptive business ethics.As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative.Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods.The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns..Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia.For example, most major corporations today promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters..Adam Smith said in 1776, \"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\"[3] Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions.Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.", "Burn": "A burn is an injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or ultraviolet radiation (like sunburn).[5] Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids (called scalding), solids, or fire.[9] Burns occur mainly in the home or the workplace.In the home, risks are associated with domestic kitchens, including stoves, flames, and hot liquids.[6] In the workplace, risks are associated with fire and chemical and electric burns.[6] Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors.[6] Burns can also occur as a result of self-harm or violence between people (assault).[6].Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns.[2][10] They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days.[2][10] When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn.[2] Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful.[2] Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur.[2] In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin.[2] Often there is no pain and the burnt area is stiff.[2] Healing typically does not occur on its own.[2] A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone.[2] The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.[2][11].Burns are generally preventable.[6] Treatment depends on the severity of the burn.[2] Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers.[2] Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature.[2][10] Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings.[2] It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large.[2] Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting.[2] Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling.[10] The most common complications of burns involve infection.[4] Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.[2].In 2015, fire and heat resulted in 67 million injuries.[7] This resulted in about 2.9 million hospitalizations and 176,000 deaths.[8][12] Among women in much of the world, burns are most commonly related to the use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves.[6] Among men, they are more likely a result of unsafe workplace conditions.[6] Most deaths due to burns occur in the developing world, particularly in Southeast Asia.[6] While large burns can be fatal, treatments developed since 1960 have improved outcomes, especially in children and young adults.[13] In the United States, approximately 96% of those admitted to a burn center survive their injuries.[14] The long-term outcome is related to the size of burn and the age of the person affected.[2].The characteristics of a burn depend upon its depth.Superficial burns cause pain lasting two or three days, followed by peeling of the skin over the next few days.[10][15] Individuals with more severe burns may indicate discomfort or complain of feeling pressure rather than pain.Full-thickness burns may be entirely insensitive to light touch or puncture.[15] While superficial burns are typically red in color, severe burns may be pink, white or black.[15] Burns around the mouth or singed hair inside the nose may indicate that burns to the airways have occurred, but these findings are not definitive.[16] More worrisome signs include: shortness of breath, hoarseness, and stridor or wheezing.[16] Itchiness is common during the healing process, occurring in up to 90% of adults and nearly all children.[17] Numbness or tingling may persist for a prolonged period of time after an electrical injury.[18] Burns may also produce emotional and psychological distress.[19].Burns are caused by a variety of external sources classified as thermal (heat-related), chemical, electrical, and radiation.[21] In the United States, the most common causes of burns are: fire or flame (44%), scalds (33%), hot objects (9%), electricity (4%), and chemicals (3%).[22] Most (69%) burn injuries occur at home or at work (9%),[14] and most are accidental, with 2% due to assault by another, and 1\u20132% resulting from a suicide attempt.[19] These sources can cause inhalation injury to the airway and/or lungs, occurring in about 6%.[4].Burn injuries occur more commonly among the poor.[19] Smoking and alcoholism are other risk factors.[9] Fire-related burns are generally more common in colder climates.[19] Specific risk factors in the developing world include cooking with open fires or on the floor[5] as well as developmental disabilities in children and chronic diseases in adults.[23].In the United States, fire and hot liquids are the most common causes of burns.[4] Of house fires that result in death, smoking causes 25% and heating devices cause 22%.[5] Almost half of injuries are due to efforts to fight a fire.[5] Scalding is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks, high temperature tap water in baths or showers, hot cooking oil, or steam.[25] Scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five[2] and, in the United States and Australia, this population makes up about two-thirds of all burns.[4] Contact with hot objects is the cause of about 20\u201330% of burns in children.[4] Generally, scalds are first- or second-degree burns, but third-degree burns may also result, especially with prolonged contact.[26] Fireworks are a common cause of burns during holiday seasons in many countries.[27] This is a particular risk for adolescent males.[28] In the United States, for non-fatal burn injuries to children, white males under the age of 6 comprise most cases.[29] Thermal burns from grabbing/touching and spilling/splashing were the most common type of burn and mechanism, while the bodily areas most impacted were hands and fingers followed by head/neck.[29].Chemical burns can be caused by over 25,000 substances,[2] most of which are either a strong base (55%) or a strong acid (26%).[30] Most chemical burn deaths are secondary to  ingestion.[2] Common agents include: sulfuric acid as found in toilet cleaners, sodium hypochlorite as found in bleach, and halogenated hydrocarbons as found in paint remover, among others.[2] Hydrofluoric acid can cause particularly deep burns that may not become symptomatic until some time after exposure.[31] Formic acid may cause the breakdown of significant numbers of red blood cells.[16].", "Atlantic Ocean": "The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's five oceans, with an area of about 85,133,000km2 (32,870,000sqmi).[2] It covers approximately 17% of Earth's surface and about 24% of its water surface area.It is known to separate the \"Old World\" of Africa, Europe, and Asia from the \"New World\" of the Americas in the European perception of the World..Through its separation of Europe, Africa, and Asia from the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean has played a central role in the development of human society, globalization, and the histories of many nations.While the Norse were the first known humans to cross the Atlantic, it was the expedition of Christopher Columbus in 1492 that proved to be the most consequential.Columbus' expedition ushered in an age of exploration and colonization of the Americas by European powers, most notably Portugal, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom.From the 16th to 19th centuries, the Atlantic Ocean was the center of both an eponymous slave trade and the Columbian exchange while occasionally hosting naval battles.Such naval battles, as well as growing trade from regional American powers like the United States and Brazil, both increased in degree during the early 20th century, and while no major military conflicts took place in the Atlantic in the present day, the ocean remains a core component of trade around the world..The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Europe and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west.As one component of the interconnected World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica).The Atlantic Ocean is divided in two parts, the Northern and Southern Atlantic, by the Equator.[5].The oldest known mentions of an \"Atlantic\" sea come from Stesichorus around mid-sixth century BC (Sch.A.", "Lists of tropical cyclone names": "Tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones are named by various warning centers to simplify communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts, watches and warnings.The names are intended to reduce confusion in the event of concurrent storms in the same basin.Once storms develop sustained wind speeds of more than 33 knots (61km/h; 38mph), names are generally assigned to them from predetermined lists, depending on the basin in which they originate.Some tropical depressions are named in the Western Pacific, while tropical cyclones must contain a significant amount of gale-force winds before they are named in the Southern Hemisphere..Before it became standard practice to give personal (first) names to tropical cyclones, they were named after places, objects, or the saints' feast days on which they occurred.Credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907.When Wragge retired, the practice fell into disuse for several years until it was revived in the latter part of World War II for the Western Pacific.Formal naming schemes and lists have subsequently been used for major storms in the Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins, and the Australian region, Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean..Before the formal start of naming, tropical cyclones were often named after places, objects, or saints' feast days on which they occurred.The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907.This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of World War II for the Western Pacific.Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the North Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.[8].", "Visible spectrum": "The visible spectrum is the band of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye.Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light (or simply light)..The optical spectrum is sometimes considered to be the same as the visible spectrum, but some authors define the term more broadly, to include the ultraviolet and infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum as well.[1].A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to about 750 nanometers.[2] In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 400\u2013790terahertz.These boundaries are not sharply defined and may vary per individual.[3] Under optimal conditions these limits of human perception can extend to 310nm (ultraviolet) and 1100nm (near infrared).[4][5][6].The spectrum does not contain all the colors that the human visual system can distinguish.Unsaturated colors such as pink, or purple variations like magenta, for example, are absent because they can only be made from a mix of multiple wavelengths.Colors containing only one wavelength are also called pure colors or spectral colors.[7].Visible wavelengths pass largely unattenuated through the Earth's atmosphere via the \"optical window\" region of the electromagnetic spectrum.An example of this phenomenon is when clean air scatters blue light more than red light, and so the midday sky appears blue (apart from the area around the Sun which appears white because the light is not scattered as much).The optical window is also referred to as the \"visible window\" because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum.The near infrared (NIR) window lies just out of the human vision, as well as the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) window, and the long-wavelength or far-infrared (LWIR or FIR) window, although other animals may perceive them..", "Zebra":

Melvin A.White, and his mother was Sadie Marie Carter.His parents never married, so his mother gave him her last name, but he later took on the surname of his father.[5][6]  He grew up in the Watts neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles, California.[7] He was the older of two children; his brother Darryl was 13 months younger.White grew up listening to his mother's classical music collection and first took to the piano, emulating what he heard on the records..White has often been credited with playing piano, at age 11, on Jesse Belvin's 1956 hit single, \"Goodnight My Love\".[8][9] However, in a 1995 interview with the Boston Herald, White denied writing or arranging the song.He believed the story was an exaggeration by journalists.While White and Belvin lived in the same neighborhood, Belvin was 12 years older than White..White attended Jacob A.", "Angelina Jolie": "Angelina Jolie[3] (/d\u0292o\u028a\u02c8li\u02d0/; born Angelina Jolie Voight;[4] June 4, 1975) is an American actress, filmmaker and humanitarian.The recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award and three Golden Globe Awards,[5] she has been named Hollywood's highest-paid actress multiple times..Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982).Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in Hackers (1995).She starred in the biographical television films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998) and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing a sociopath in the 1999 drama Girl, Interrupted.Her role as the titular heroine in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a star.She continued her action-star career with Mr.& Mrs.Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010).She also received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008); the latter earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.Her biggest commercial successes include the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014), its 2019 sequel, and the superhero film Eternals (2021).She has performed a voice role in the animation film series Kung Fu Panda since 2008.", "erosion": "Erosion is the action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that removes soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust and then transports it to another location where it is deposited.Erosion is distinct from weathering which involves no movement.[1][2] Removal of rock or soil as clastic sediment is referred to as physical or mechanical erosion; this contrasts with chemical erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by dissolution.[3] Eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres, or for thousands of kilometres..Agents of erosion include rainfall;[4] bedrock wear in rivers; coastal erosion by the sea and waves; glacial plucking, abrasion, and scour; areal flooding; wind abrasion; groundwater processes; and mass movement processes in steep landscapes like landslides and debris flows.The rates at which such processes act control how fast a surface is eroded.Typically, physical erosion proceeds the fastest on steeply sloping surfaces, and rates may also be sensitive to some climatically controlled properties including amounts of water supplied (e.g., by rain), storminess, wind speed, wave fetch, or atmospheric temperature (especially for some ice-related processes).Feedbacks are also possible between rates of erosion and the amount of eroded material that is already carried by, for example, a river or glacier.[5][6] The transport of eroded materials from their original location is followed by deposition, which is arrival and emplacement of material at a new location.[1].While erosion is a natural process, human activities have increased by 10\u201340 times the rate at which soil erosion is occurring globally.[7] At agriculture sites in the Appalachian Mountains, intensive farming practices have caused erosion at up to 100 times the natural rate of erosion in the region.[8] Excessive (or accelerated) erosion causes both \"on-site\" and \"off-site\" problems.On-site impacts include decreases in agricultural productivity and (on natural landscapes) ecological collapse, both because of loss of the nutrient-rich upper soil layers.In some cases, this leads to desertification.Off-site effects include sedimentation of waterways and eutrophication of water bodies, as well as sediment-related damage to roads and houses.Water and wind erosion are the two primary causes of land degradation; combined, they are responsible for about 84% of the global extent of degraded land, making excessive erosion one of the most significant environmental problems worldwide.[9]:\u200a2\u200a[10]:\u200a1\u200a[11].Intensive agriculture, deforestation, roads, anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl are amongst the most significant human activities in regard to their effect on stimulating erosion.[12] However, there are many prevention and remediation practices that can curtail or limit erosion of vulnerable soils..", "Jersey Shore (TV series)": "Jersey Shore is an American reality television series that ran on MTV from December 3, 2009, to December 20, 2012.The series follows the lives of eight housemates at a vacation home in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, on the Jersey Shore in seasons one, three, five, and six; South Beach, Florida, in season two; and Florence, Italy, in season four..The show debuted amid controversy regarding its use of the terms \"Guido/Guidette\", its portrayal of Italian-Americans, and allegations of perpetuating stereotypes.It also was criticized by locals who observed that the cast members were not residents of the area.[1][2][3][4] (Most were from New York, and at least two of them were not Italian)..The show became a pop culture phenomenon with classes and conferences at universities about the show and journalists listing it as one of the most notable shows of the time.The Shore franchise spawned several international adaptations in other countries.Four of the Jersey Shore cast members received spin-off shows on MTV, with the most successful being Snooki & Jwoww.Most of the cast went on to appear in other reality programs or receive their own shows on various networks..On August 20, 2017, a one-off television special called Reunion Road Trip: Return to the Jersey Shore aired on the E! network.[5][6] On November 27, 2017, MTV announced that the cast (with the exception of Giancola) would be reuniting in Miami, Florida, for a new reunion series titled Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.[7] The series premiered globally on April 5, 2018.[7][8].A spin-off series, All Star Shore, was released on June 29, 2022.It features Jersey Shore and other reality stars from around the world as they live together in a villa to compete for $150,000..VH1 producer Anthony Beltempo proposed the idea of a show focusing on the \"guido\" lifestyle for TV, in the form of a male competition series.[43] Executive producer SallyAnn Salsano, who previously worked on A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila, devised a new concept, inspired by her own summers in a Jersey summer shore house, and retained casting director Doron Ofir to find the cast.", "United States territory": "In the United States, a territory is any extent of region under the sovereign jurisdiction of the federal government of the United States,[1] including all waters (around islands or continental tracts).The United States asserts sovereign rights for exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing its territory.[2] This extent of territory is all the area belonging to, and under the dominion of, the United States federal government (which includes tracts lying at a distance from the country) for administrative and other purposes.[1] The United States total territory includes a subset of political divisions..The United States' territory includes any geography under the control of the United States federal government.Various regions, districts, and divisions are under the supervision of the United States federal government.The United States' territory includes clearly defined geographical area and refers to an area of land, air, or sea under jurisdiction of United States federal governmental authority (but is not limited only to these areas).The extent of territory is all the area belonging to, and under the dominion of, the United States of America federal government (which includes tracts lying at a distance from the country) for administrative and other purposes..Under Article IV of the U.S.Constitution, a territory is subject to and belongs to the United States (but not necessarily within the national boundaries or any individual state).This includes tracts of land or water not included within the limits of any State and not admitted as a State into the Union..The Constitution of the United States states:.The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State..Congress possesses power to set territorial governments within the boundaries of the United States, under Article 4, Section 3 of the U.S.", "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines[a] is a 2003 science fiction action film that is the third installment in the Terminator franchise and a sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).It is directed by Jonathan Mostow and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna Loken.In its plot, the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a T-X (Loken)\u2014a highly advanced Terminator\u2014back in time to ensure the rise of machines by killing top members of the future human resistance as John Connor's (Stahl) location is unknown.The resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-850 (Schwarzenegger) to protect John and his future wife, Kate (Danes)..While Terminator creator James Cameron was interested in directing the third film, he ultimately had no involvement with Terminator 3.Andrew G.Vajna and Mario Kassar, who had produced Terminator 2: Judgment Day through their company Carolco Pictures, obtained the rights for the franchise through both Carolco's liquidation auction and negotiations with producer Gale Ann Hurd.In 1999, Tedi Sarafian was hired to write the first draft of the script.Mostow joined the project as director in 2001, and he brought on John Brancato and Michael Ferris to rewrite Sarafian's script.The $187 million budget included a $5 million salary for Mostow and a record $30 million salary for Schwarzenegger.Filming took place in California from April to September 2002.Industrial Light & Magic and Stan Winston created the special effects, as they did for the previous film..", "Cord (unit)": "The cord is a unit of measure of dry volume used to measure firewood and pulpwood in the United States and Canada..A cord is the amount of wood that, when \"racked and well stowed\" (arranged so pieces are aligned, parallel, touching and compact), occupies a volume of 128 cubic feet (3.62m3).[1] This corresponds to a well-stacked woodpile 4 feet (122cm) high, 8 feet (244cm) wide, and 4 feet (122cm) deep; or any other arrangement of linear measurements that yields the same volume..The name cord probably comes from the use of a cord or string to measure it.[2].The cord-foot was a US unit of volume for stacked firewood, four feet long, four feet wide and one foot high\u2014equal to one eighth of a cord.[3] The symbol for the unit was cd-ft.[4].In Canada, the cord is legally defined by Measurement Canada.The cord is one of three legal standards for the sale of firewood in Canada:  stacked cubic metre (or stere), cubic foot, and cord..In the United States, the cord is defined by statute in most states.The U.S.National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 130, section 2.4.1.2,[5] defines a cord and provides uniform regulations for the sale of fireplace and stove wood.In the metric system, wood is usually measured in steres and cubic metres: 1stere = 1m3 \u2248 0.276cords..Maine appears unique among U.S.states by also defining a \"loose thrown cord\" or pile of cut firewood: \"A cord of 12 or 16 inches (30 or 41cm) in length shall mean the amount of wood, bark and air contained in a space of 180 cubic feet (5.1m3); and a cord of wood 24 inches (61cm) in length shall mean the amount of wood, bark and air contained in a space of 195 cubic feet (5.5m3).", "Game Boy": "The Game Boy is an 8-bit fourth generation handheld game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo.It was first released in Japan on April 21, 1989, in North America later the same year, and in Europe in late 1990.It was designed by the same team that developed the Game & Watch series of handheld electronic games and several Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games: Satoru Okada, Gunpei Yokoi, and Nintendo Research & Development 1.[14][15].It is Nintendo's second handheld game console and combines features from both the Game & Watch handheld and NES home system.The console features a dot-matrix screen with adjustable contrast dial, five game control buttons (a directional pad, two game buttons, and \"START\" and \"SELECT\"), a single speaker with adjustable volume dial and, like its rivals, uses cartridges as physical media for games.The color scheme is made from two tones of grey with accents of black, blue, and dark magenta.All the corners of the portrait-oriented rectangular unit are softly rounded, except for the bottom right, which is curved.At launch, it was sold either as a standalone unit, or bundled with one of several games, among them Super Mario Land and Tetris.Several accessories were also developed, including a carrying pouch, a camera, and a printer..The Game Boy received mixed reviews from critics and was deemed technologically inferior to its fourth-generation competitors (Sega's Game Gear, Atari's Lynx, and NEC's TurboExpress).Its lack of a backlight, graphics, bulky design and price were met with criticism, but it also received praise for its battery life, library of games and durability in its construction.It quickly outsold the competition,[16] selling one million units in the United States within a few weeks.[17] An estimated 118.69 million units of the Game Boy and its successor, the Game Boy Color,[13] have been sold worldwide,[9] making it the fourth best-selling video game console of all time.", "World Trade Center": "One World Trade Center, also known as One World Trade, One WTC, and formerly called  the Freedom Tower during initial planning stages,[note 1] is the main building of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, New York City.Designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, One World Trade Center is the tallest building in the United States, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, and the seventh-tallest in the world.The supertall structure has the same name as the North Tower of the original World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.The new skyscraper stands on the northwest corner of the 16-acre (6.5ha) World Trade Center site, on the site of the original 6 World Trade Center.It is bounded by West Street to the west, Vesey Street to the north, Fulton Street to the south, and Washington Street to the east..The construction of below-ground utility relocations, footings, and foundations for the new building began on April 27, 2006.One World Trade Center became the tallest structure in New York City on April 30, 2012, when it surpassed the height of the Empire State Building.The tower's steel structure was topped out on August 30, 2012.On May 10, 2013, the final component of the skyscraper's spire was installed, making the building, including its spire, reach a total height of 1,776 feet (541m).Its height in feet is a deliberate reference to the year when the United States Declaration of Independence was signed.The building opened on November 3, 2014;[14] the One World Observatory opened on May 29, 2015.[15].On March 26, 2009, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) confirmed that the building would be officially known by its legal name of \"One World Trade Center\", rather than its colloquial name of \"Freedom Tower\".[16][17][18] The building has 94 stories, with the top floor numbered 104..", "Transverse Ranges": "The Transverse Ranges are a group of mountain ranges of southern California, in the Pacific Coast Ranges physiographic region in North America.The Transverse Ranges begin at the southern end of the California Coast Ranges and lie within Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside and Kern counties.The Peninsular Ranges lie to the south.The name Transverse Ranges is due to their east\u2013west orientation, making them transverse to the general northwest\u2013southeast orientation of most of California's coastal mountains.[1][2][3][4].The ranges extend from west of Point Conception eastward approximately 500 kilometers into the Mojave and Colorado Desert.The geology and topography of the ranges express three distinct segments that have contrasting elevations, rock types, and vegetation.The western segment extends to the San Gabriel Mountains and San Gabriel fault.The central segment includes mountains that range eastward to the San Andreas fault.The eastern segment extends from the San Andreas fault eastward to the Colorado Desert.[1] The central and eastern segments (near the San Andreas fault) have the highest elevations..Most of the ranges lie in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion.Lower elevations are dominated by chaparral and scrubland, while higher elevations support large conifer forests.Most of the ranges in the system are fault blocks, and were uplifted by tectonic movements late in the Cenozoic Era.", "Electron shell": "In chemistry and atomic physics, an electron shell may be thought of as an orbit that electrons follow around an atom's nucleus.The closest shell to the nucleus is called the \"1 shell\" (also called the \"K shell\"), followed by the \"2 shell\" (or \"L shell\"), then the \"3 shell\" (or \"M shell\"), and so on farther and farther from the nucleus.The shells correspond to the principal quantum numbers (n = 1, 2, 3, 4...) or are labeled alphabetically with the letters used in X-ray notation (K, L, M,...).A useful guide when understanding electron shells in atoms is to note that each row on the conventional periodic table of elements represents an electron shell..Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: the first shell can hold up to two electrons, the second shell can hold up to eight (2 + 6) electrons, the third shell can hold up to 18 (2 + 6 + 10) and so on.The general formula is that the nth shell can in principle hold up to 2(n2) electrons.[1] For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells, see electron configuration.[2].Each shell consists of one or more subshells, and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals..In 1913, Bohr proposed a model of the atom, giving the arrangement of electrons in their sequential orbits.At that time, Bohr allowed the capacity of the inner orbit of the atom to increase to eight electrons as the atoms got larger, and \"in the scheme given below the number of electrons in this [outer] ring is arbitrary put equal to the normal valency of the corresponding element\".Using these and other constraints, he proposed configurations that are in accord with those now known only for the first six elements.\"From the above we are led to the following possible scheme for the arrangement of the electrons in light atoms:\"[3][4].The shell terminology comes from Arnold Sommerfeld's modification of the 1913 Bohr model.", "Anna Nicole Smith": "Anna Nicole Smith (born Vickie Lynn Hogan; November 28, 1967 \u2013 February 8, 2007) was an American model, actress, and television personality.Smith started her career as a Playboy magazine centerfold in May 1992 and won the title of 1993 Playmate of the Year.She later modeled for fashion companies, including Guess, H&M, and Heatherette..Smith dropped out of high school in 1984, married in 1985, and divorced in 1993.In 1994, her highly publicized second marriage to 89-year-old billionaire J.Howard Marshall resulted in speculation that she married him for his money, which she denied.Following Marshall's death in 1995, Smith began a lengthy legal battle over a share of his estate.Her cases reached the Supreme Court of the United States: Marshall v.Marshall on a question of federal jurisdiction and Stern v.Marshall on a question of bankruptcy court authority.Smith died in February 2007 in Hollywood, Florida, of a combined drug intoxication..Smith was born Vickie Lynn Hogan on November 28, 1967, in Houston, Texas, the only daughter of Virgie (n\u00e9e Tabers) Arthur (1951\u20132018) and Donald Hogan (1947\u20132009).", "5 yen coin": "The 5 yen coin (\u4e94\u5186\u786c\u8ca8, Go-en k\u014dka) is a denomination of the Japanese yen.The current design was first minted in 1959 using Japanese characters known as the \"new script\", and were also minted from 1948 to 1958 using \"old-script\" Japanese characters.Five-yen coins date to 1870 (when, due to the much higher value of the yen, they were minted in gold).The modern-day coin was first produced in 1948 with a differently styled inscription.This was changed in 1959 and the design has remained unchanged since..The obverse of the coin depicts a rice plant growing out of the water, with \"five yen\" written in kanji; the reverse is stamped with \"Japan\" and the year of issue, also in kanji, separated by sprouts of a tree.The three graphic elements of the coin represent agriculture and fisheries, the key elements of the Japanese first-sector economy.Around the central hole, there is a gear that represents industry.It is the only Japanese coin in circulation to lack Arabic numerals on either side..Five yen coins were first struck in gold for the Japanese government in 1870 at the San Francisco Mint.[1] During this time a new mint was being established at Osaka, which did not receive the gold bullion needed for coinage until the following year.[2] The yen as a unit of currency was officially adopted by the Meiji government in an act signed on June 27, 1871.[3] For this particular denomination, its not known if any five yen coins dated 1871 (year 4) were actually struck that year as official records have coinage beginning in 1872.[4][5] The first and second five yen coin designs feature a dragon figure on the obverse surrounded by legends, while the reverse features the emblem of the Imperial family.[a] Each coin was initially struck in .900 fine gold with a weight of 8.3g, and a diameter of 23.8mm.[6] The diameter was later reduced to 21.8mm when the second design was introduced in 1872.[7] Five yen coins continued to be struck uninterrupted until 1879, when for an unknown reason none were recorded as minted.Coinage resumed in 1880 and remained unchanged until 1897 when Japan officially switched from a silver standard to a gold standard.[8] During this time the gold five yen coin was given a third and final new design.The diameter was reduced from 21.8mm down to 16.9mm, and the weight was changed from 8.3 to 4.2 grams.", "TLC (group)": "TLC is an American girl group formed in 1990 in Atlanta, Georgia.The group's best-known line-up was composed of Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes and Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas.The group enjoyed success during the 1990s,[1] with nine top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including four number-one singles: \"Creep\", \"Waterfalls\", \"No Scrubs\", and \"Unpretty\".[2] The group also recorded four multi-platinum albums, including CrazySexyCool (1994), which received a diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[3] TLC also became the first R&B group in history to receive the Million certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for FanMail (1999).[4].Having sold over 65 million records worldwide, TLC is the best-selling American girl group of all time.[5][6] VH1 ranked TLC as the greatest female group, placing them at number 12 on the list of 100 Greatest Women in Music.[7] Billboard magazine ranked TLC as one of the greatest musical trios,[8] as well as the seventh-most-successful act of the 1990s.The group's accolades include four career Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards, and five Soul Train Music Awards..Twenty years after their debut, TLC was honored with an award called Outstanding Contribution to Music at the 17th MOBO Awards and with the Legend Award at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards Japan.Following Lopes's death in 2002, instead of replacing her, the remaining members chose to continue as a duo.In 2017, they released their eponymous fifth album TLC.In 2022, the group was inducted into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame.[9].In 1990, Atlanta-based record producer Ian Burke and one of his clients, a teenager named Crystal Jones, came up with a concept for a girl group with a tomboyish, hip-hop image, similar to the blend of contemporary R&B and hip-hop music of new jack swing act Bell Biv DeVoe.[10] Jones put out a call for two more girls to join her, eventually answered by Tionne Watkins, a native of Des Moines, Iowa, who had moved to Atlanta with her family at a young age, and Lisa Lopes, a rapper who had just moved to the city from her native Philadelphia with a small keyboard and $750 ($1,680 today).The group, then named \"2nd Nature\", was formed of Jones, Watkins, and Lopes, who then began working with producers Jermaine Dupri and Rico Wade on demo tape material.[10].Through a connection at the hair salon where Watkins worked,[11] the group eventually managed to arrange an audition with singer Perri \"Pebbles\" Reid, who had started her own management and production company, Pebbitone.", "Tarzan (1999 film)": "Tarzan is a 1999 American animated adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures.It is based on the 1912 story Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs, being the first animated major motion picture version of the story.The film was directed by Kevin Lima and Chris Buck (in his feature directorial debut) and produced by Bonnie Arnold, from a screenplay by Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker, and Noni White.It stars the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Rosie O'Donnell, Brian Blessed, Lance Henriksen, Wayne Knight, and Nigel Hawthorne..Pre-production of Tarzan began in 1995, with Lima selected as director[3] and Buck joining him the same year.Following Murphy's first draft, Tzudiker, White, and Dave Reynolds (who was uncredited in the final cut), were brought in to reconstruct the third act and add additional material to the screenplay.English recording artist Phil Collins was recruited to compose and record songs integrated with a score by Mark Mancina.Meanwhile, the production team embarked on a research trip to Uganda and Kenya to study the gorillas.The animation of the film combines 2D hand-drawn animation with the extensive use of computer-generated imagery, and it was done in California, Orlando, and Paris, with the pioneering computer animation software system Deep Canvas being predominantly used to create three-dimensional backgrounds..Tarzan premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on June 12, 1999, and was released in the United States on June 16.It received positive reviews from critics, who praised its voice performances, music, animation, and action sequences.Against a production budget of $130 million (then the most expensive traditionally animated film ever made until Treasure Planet in 2002), the film grossed $448.2 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 1999, the second highest-grossing animated film of 1999 behind Toy Story 2, and the first Disney animated feature to open at first place at the North American box office since Pocahontas (1995).", "Oil platform": "An oil platform (also called an oil rig, offshore platform, oil production platform, etc.) is a large structure with facilities to extract and process petroleum and natural gas that lie in rock formations beneath the seabed.Many oil platforms will also have facilities to accommodate the workers, although it is also common to have a separate accommodation platform bridge linked to the production platform.Most commonly, oil platforms engage in activities on the continental shelf, though they can also be used in lakes, inshore waters, and inland seas.Depending on the circumstances, the platform may be fixed to the ocean floor, consist of an artificial island, or float.[1] In some arrangements the main facility may have storage facilities for the processed oil.Remote subsea wells may also be connected to a platform by flow lines and by umbilical connections.These sub-sea facilities may include one or more subsea wells or manifold centres for multiple wells..Offshore drilling presents environmental challenges, both from the produced hydrocarbons and the materials used during the drilling operation.Controversies include the ongoing US offshore drilling debate.[2].There are many different types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place.These include bottom-founded drilling rigs (jackup barges and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities, either bottom-founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU), including semi-submersibles and drillships.These are capable of operating in water depths up to 3,000 metres (9,800ft).In shallower waters, the mobile units are anchored to the seabed.", "Animal slaughter": "Animal slaughter is the killing of  animals, usually referring to killing domestic livestock.It is estimated that each year, 80 billion land animals are slaughtered for food.[1] Most animals are slaughtered for food; however, they may also be slaughtered for other reasons such as for harvesting of pelts, being diseased and unsuitable for consumption, or being surplus for maintaining a breeding stock.Slaughter typically involves some initial cutting, opening the major body cavities to remove the entrails and offal but usually leaving the carcass in one piece.Such dressing can be done by hunters in the field (field dressing of game) or in a slaughterhouse.Later, the carcass is usually butchered into smaller cuts..The animals most commonly slaughtered for food are cattle and water buffalo, sheep, goats,  pigs, deers, horses, poultry (mainly chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese), insects (a commercial species is the house cricket), and increasingly, fish in the aquaculture industry (fish farming).In 2020, Faunalytics reported that the countries with the largest number of slaughtered cows and chickens are China, the United States, and Brazil.Concerning pigs, they are slaughtered by far the most in China, followed by the United States, Germany, Spain, Vietnam, and Brazil.For sheep, again China slaughtered the most, this time followed by Australia and New Zealand.Similarly, the amount (in tonnes) of fish used for production is highest in China, Indonesia, Peru, India, Russia, and the United States (in that order).[2].The use of a sharpened blade for the slaughtering of livestock has been practised throughout history.Prior to the development of electric stunning equipment, some species were killed by simply striking them with a blunt instrument, sometimes followed by exsanguination with a knife.[citation needed].", "List of Presidents of the United States": "The president of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States,[1] indirectly elected to a four-year term via the Electoral College.[2] The officeholder leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.[3] Since the office was established in 1789, 45 men have served in 46 presidencies.The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.[4] Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.[5] The incumbent president is Joe Biden.[6].The presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history.[7] Franklin D.Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945.He is the only U.S.president to have served more than two terms.[8] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[9].Four presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G.Harding, and Franklin D.Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A.Garfield, William McKinley, and John F.Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office).[10] John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his presidency.[11].Throughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties.", "Suppressor": "A silencer, also known as a sound suppressor, suppressor, or sound moderator, is a muzzle device that suppresses the blast created when a gun (firearm or airgun) is discharged, therefore reducing the acoustic intensity of the muzzle report (sound of a gunshot) and jump, by modulating the speed and pressure of the propellant gas released from the muzzle.Like other muzzle devices, a silencer can be a detachable accessory mounted to the muzzle, or an integral part of the barrel..A typical silencer is a metallic (usually stainless steel or titanium) cylinder containing numerous internal sound baffles, with a hollow bore to allow the projectile (bullet) to exit normally.During firing, the bullet flies through the bore with little hindrance, but most of the expanding gas ejecta behind it is redirected through a longer and convoluted escape path created by the baffles, prolonging the release time.This slows down the gas and dissipates its kinetic energy into a larger surface area, reducing the blast intensity, thus lowering the loudness.[1].Silencers can also reduce the recoil during shooting, but unlike a muzzle brake or a recoil compensator, which reduce recoil by vectoring the muzzle blast sideways, silencers release almost all the gases towards the front.However, the internal baffles significantly prolong the time of the gas release and therefore decrease the rearward thrust generated \u2014 as for the same impulse, force is inversely proportional to time.The weight of the silencer itself and the leverage of its mounting location (at the far front end of the barrel) will also help counter muzzle rise..Because the internal baffles will slow and cool the released gas and contain gunpowder that is still burning upon exit from the muzzle, silencers also reduce or even eliminate the muzzle flash.This is different from a flash suppressor, which reduces the amount of flash by dispersing burning gases that are already released outside the muzzle, without necessarily reducing sound or recoil.A flash hider, or muzzle shroud, on the other hand, conceals visible flashes by screening them from the direct line of sight, rather than reducing the intensity of the flash..In 1892 a Swiss inventor called Jakob Stahel patented a silencer intended for killing cattle though he claimed it could be adapted to other firearms too.[2].", "Bea Arthur": "Beatrice Arthur (born Bernice Frankel; May 13, 1922\u2013 April 25, 2009) was an American actress and comedienne.She began her career on stage in 1947, attracting critical acclaim before achieving worldwide recognition for her work on television beginning in the 1970s as Maude Findlay in the popular sitcoms All in the Family (1971\u20131972) and Maude (1972\u20131978) and later in the 1980s and 1990s as Dorothy Zbornak on The Golden Girls (1985\u20131992)..Arthur won several accolades throughout her career, beginning with the 1966 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for playing Vera Charles in Mame.She won Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1977 for Maude and 1988 for The Golden Girls.Arthur has received the third most nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series with nine; after Julia Louis-Dreyfus (11) and Mary Tyler Moore (10).Arthur was inducted into the academy's Television Hall of Fame in 2008.[1].Arthur's film appearances include Lovers and Other Strangers (1970) and the film version of Mame (1974).In 2002, she starred in the one-woman show Bea Arthur on Broadway: Just Between Friends.An obituary described Arthur as \"the tall, deep-voiced actress whose razor-sharp delivery of comedy lines made her a TV star.\"[2].Bernice Frankel was born on May 13, 1922 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, to Rebecca (n\u00e9e Pressner, born in Austria) and Philip Frankel (born in Poland).[3][4] Arthur was raised in a Jewish home with her older sister Gertrude and younger sister Marian (1926\u20132014).[5].In 1933, the Frankel family relocated to Cambridge, Maryland, where her parents subsequently operated a women's clothing shop.At age 16, Bernice developed a serious condition, coagulopathy, in which her blood would not clot.[6] Concerned for her health, her parents sent her to Linden Hall, an all-girls' boarding school in Lititz, Pennsylvania, for her final two years of high school.[6] Afterwards, she studied for a year at Blackstone College for Girls in Blackstone, Virginia.[7].", "Tekken: Blood Vengeance": "Tekken: Blood Vengeance (Japanese: \u9244\u62f3 \u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d9\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30b9, Hepburn: Tekken Buraddo Benjensu) is a 2011 Japanese 3D computer-animated science fiction martial arts film directed by Y\u014dichi M\u014dri from a screenplay by Dai Sat\u014d, based on the video game series Tekken published by Namco Bandai Games.The film places focus on the young martial artist Ling Xiaoyu, who investigates experiments involving a supernatural curse related with the Mishima family, while befriending a robot named Alisa Bosconovitch.The two meet the test subject Shin Kamiya, who is being sought by his former friend Jin Kazama and his father Kazuya Mishima, but is also being used by Heihachi Mishima to set a new family fight..Sat\u014d was given freedom by the video game series' executive directorKatsuhiro Harada to write the film, which led him to the idea of Blood Vengeance being a buddy film by two female characters from different generations of video games.Tekken: Blood Vengeance was released in the United States on July 26, 2011, and in Australia on July 27, 2011, in a special exclusive one-off screening.It was released in Japan on September 3, 2011, by Namco Pictures.The film was released on Blu-ray Disc (included on the disc of the video game collection Tekken Hybrid) in the United States on November 22, 2011, and in Japan on December 1, 2011.The 2D version of the film was also released as a standalone DVD on November 22, 2011, in the US, and December 22, 2011, in Japan.It was later included with the video game Tekken 3D: Prime Edition..The film was praised for its visuals and fight sequences, but criticized for its short length and few characters who have little impact in the story.Nevertheless, the film attracted Western audiences upon release.It was often considered as one of the best adaptations based on the video game series.[citation needed].", "Homeowner association": "A homeowner association (or homeowners' association, abbreviated HOA, sometimes referred to as a property owners' association or POA), or a homeowner community, is a private association-like entity in the United States, Canada, The Philippines and certain other countries often formed either ipso jure in a building with multiple owner-occupancies, or by a real estate developer for the purpose of marketing, managing, and selling homes and lots in a residential subdivision.[original research?] The developer will typically transfer control of the association to the homeowners after selling a predetermined number of lots..Generally any person who wants to buy a residence within the area of a homeowners association must become a member, and therefore must obey the governing documents including articles of incorporation, CC&Rs (covenants, conditions and restrictions) and by-laws, which may limit the owner's choices in exterior design modifications (e.g., paint colors).Homeowner associations are especially active in urban planning, zoning and land use, decisions that affect the pace of growth, the quality of life, the level of taxation and the value of land in the community.[1].Most homeowner associations are incorporated, and are subject to state statutes that govern non-profit corporations and homeowner associations.State oversight of homeowner associations varies from state to state; some states, such as Florida[2] and California[3] (see Davis\u2013Stirling), have a large body of HOA law.Other states, such as Massachusetts,[4] have virtually no HOA law.[original research?] Homeowners associations are commonly found in residential developments since the passage of the Davis\u2013Stirling Common Interest Development Act in 1985.In Canada, homeowner associations are subject to stringent provincial regulations and are thus quite rare compared to the United States.However in recent decades, HOA's have infrequently been created in new subdivision developments in Alberta and Ontario..The fastest-growing form of housing in the United States today are common-interest developments (CIDs), a category that includes planned unit developments of single-family homes, condominiums, and cooperative apartments.[relevant?][5] Since 1964, HOAs have become increasingly common in the United States.The Community Associations Institute trade association estimated that in 2010, HOAs governed 24.8 million American homes and 62 million residents.[6] Throughout the rest of the world, homeowner associations\u2014though they do exist in some neighborhoods\u2014are uncommon.[original research?].Some of the first HOAs were formed early in the 20th century in Los Angeles County, beginning with the Arroyo Seco Improvement Association in Pasadena founded around 1905 and the Los Feliz Improvement Association in Los Angeles founded in 1916.These were the children of deed restrictions in a new kind of planned subdivision, and they established the national legal precedent for zoning districts exclusively for upscale, single-family residences.", "List of guinea pig breeds": "There are many breeds of guinea pig or cavy which have been developed since its domestication circa 5000 BCE.Breeds vary widely in appearance and purpose, ranging from show breeds with long, flowing hair to laboratory breeds being used as model organisms for science.From roughly 1200 to 1532 CE (during the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire), selective breeding by indigenous South American people resulted in many landrace varieties of domestic guinea pigs, which form the basis for some formal modern breeds.[1] Early Andean varieties were primarily kept as agricultural stock for food, and efforts at improving cavy breeds (cuy) bred for food continue to the modern era, with entirely separate breeds that focus on size and disease resistance..With the export of guinea pigs to Europe in the 15th century, the goal in breeding shifted to focus on the development of appealing pets.To this end, various competitive breeding organizations were founded by fanciers.The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the American Rabbit Breeders Association, is the governing body in the United States and Canada.[2][3] The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom.[4] For Australia and New Zealand, there are the Australian National Cavy Council and the New Zealand Cavy Council.[5][6] Each club publishes its own \"standard of perfection\" and determines which breeds are eligible for showing.New breeds are continuously emerging, which may or may not be recognized by these breeding organizations..Though there are many breeds of guinea pig, only a few found on the show table are common as pets.Most pet guinea pigs were either found undesirable by breeders,[clarification needed] or else were bred to be pleasant pets regardless of how well they met the \"standard of perfection\" for the breed.The American (short-haired), the Abyssinian (rough-coated), the Peruvian (long-coated), and the Sheltie/Silkie (also long-coated) are the breeds most frequently seen as pets.Besides the Silkie, they also historically form the core breeds in the competitive showing of guinea pigs.In addition to their standard form, nearly all breeds come in a satin variant.", "state school": "A state school or public school is a primary or secondary school that educates all students without charge.Such schools are funded in whole or in part by taxation..State-funded schools exist in virtually every country of the world,  though there are significant variations in their structure and educational programmes.Government funded education generally encompasses primary and secondary education (4 years old to 18 years old)..In South Africa, a state school or government school refers to a school that is state-controlled.These are officially called public schools according to the South African Schools Act of 1996, but it is a term that is not used colloquially.The Act recognised two categories of schools: public and independent.Independent schools include all private schools and schools that are privately governed.Independent schools with low tuition fees are state-aided and receive a subsidy on a sliding-scale.Traditional private schools that charge high fees receive no state subsidy..State schools are all state-owned, including section 21 schools (formerly referred to as \"model C\" or semi-private schools) that have a governing body and a degree of budget autonomy, as these are still fully owned and accountable to the state..Per the Canadian constitution, public-school education in Canada is a provincial responsibility and, as such, there are many variations among the provinces.", "Ribosome": "Ribosomes (/\u02c8ra\u026ab\u0259\u02ccso\u028am, -bo\u028a-/) are macromolecular machines, found within all  cells, that perform biological protein synthesis (mRNA translation).Ribosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by the codons of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules to form polypeptide chains.Ribosomes consist of two major components: the small and large ribosomal subunits.Each subunit consists of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and many ribosomal proteins (RPs or r-proteins).[1][2][3] The ribosomes and associated molecules are also known as the translational apparatus..The sequence of DNA that encodes the sequence of the amino acids in a protein is transcribed into a messenger RNA chain.Ribosomes bind to messenger RNAs and use their sequences to determine the correct sequence of amino acids to generate a given protein.Amino acids are selected and carried to the ribosome by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which enter the ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain via an anti-codon stem loop.For each coding triplet (codon) in the messenger RNA, there is a unique transfer RNA that must have the exact anti-codon match, and carries the correct amino acid for incorporating into a growing polypeptide chain.Once the protein is produced, it can then fold to produce a functional three-dimensional structure..A ribosome is made from complexes of RNAs and proteins and is therefore a ribonucleoprotein complex.Each ribosome is composed of small (30S) and large (50S) components, called subunits, which are bound to each other:.The synthesis of proteins from their building blocks takes place in four phases: initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling.", "Light-independent reactions": "The Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions, bio synthetic phase, dark reactions, or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle[1] of photosynthesis is a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and hydrogen-carrier compounds into glucose.The Calvin cycle is present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and also many photosynthetic bacteria.In plants, these reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled region of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes.These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them.The Calvin cycle  uses the chemical energy of ATP and reducing power of NADPH from the light dependent reactions to produce sugars for the plant to use.These substrates are used in a series of reduction-oxidation reactions to produce sugars in a step-wise process; there is no direct reaction that converts several molecules of CO2 to a sugar.There are three phases to the light-independent reactions, collectively called the Calvin cycle: carboxylation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration..Though it is called the \"dark reaction\", the Calvin cycle does not actually occur in the dark or during night time.This is because the process requires NADPH, which is short-lived and comes from the light-dependent reactions.In the dark, plants instead release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves to provide energy for the plant.The Calvin cycle thus happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis (C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation, and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM)); CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day to make this process work.[2].The reactions of the Calvin cycle are closely coupled to the thylakoid electron transport chain as the energy required to reduce the carbon dioxide is provided by NADPH produced during the light dependent reactions.", "Square number": "In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer;[1] in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.For example, 9 is a square number, since it equals 32 and can be written as 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093..The usual notation for the square of a number n is not the product n\u2009\u00d7\u2009n, but the equivalent exponentiation n2, usually pronounced as \"n squared\".The name square number comes from the name of the shape.The unit of area is defined as the area of a unit square (1\u2009\u00d7\u20091).Hence, a square with side length n has area n2.If a square number is represented by n points, the points can be arranged in rows as a square each side of which has the same number of points as the square root of n; thus, square numbers are a type of figurate numbers (other examples being cube numbers and triangular numbers)..In the real number system, square numbers are non-negative.A non-negative integer is a square number when its square root is again an integer.For example,.9.=.", "Era of Good Feelings": "The Era of Good Feelings marked a period in the political history of the United States that reflected a sense of national purpose and a desire for unity among Americans in the aftermath of the  War of 1812.[1][2] The era saw the collapse of the Federalist Party and an end to the bitter partisan disputes between it and the dominant Democratic-Republican Party during the First Party System.[3][4] President James Monroe strove to downplay partisan affiliation in making his nominations, with the ultimate goal of national unity and eliminating political parties altogether from national politics.[1][5][6] The period is so closely associated with Monroe's presidency (1817\u20131825) and his administrative goals that his name and the era are virtually synonymous.[7].During and after the 1824 presidential election, the Democratic-Republican Party split between supporters and opponents of Jacksonian Democracy, leading to the Second Party System..The designation of the period by historians as one of good feelings is often conveyed with irony or skepticism, as the history of the era was one in which the political atmosphere was strained and divisive, especially among factions within the Monroe administration and the Democratic-Republican Party.[3][8][9].The phrase Era of Good Feelings was coined by Benjamin Russell in the Boston Federalist newspaper Columbian Centinel on July 12, 1817, following Monroe's visit to Boston, Massachusetts, as part of his good-will tour of the United States.[7][10][11].The Era of Good Feelings started in 1815 at the end of the War of 1812.[2] Exultation replaced the bitter political divisions between Federalists and Republicans, the North and South, and the East Coast cities and settlers on the American frontier.The political hostilities declined because the Federalist Party had largely dissolved after the fiasco of the Hartford Convention in 1814\u201315.[12] As a party, Federalists \"had collapsed as a national political force\".[13][14][15] The Democratic-Republican Party was nominally dominant, but in practice it was inactive at the national level and in most states.[16].The era saw a trend toward national institutions that envisioned \"a permanent federal role in the crucial arena of national development and national prosperity\".[17] Monroe's predecessor, President James Madison, and the Republican Party, had come to appreciate \u2013 through the crucible of war \u2013 the expediency of Federalist institutions and projects, and prepared to legislate them under the auspices of John C.Calhoun and Henry Clay's American System.[18][19][20][21].Madison announced this shift in policy with his Seventh Annual Message to Congress in December 1815, subsequently authorizing measures for a national bank and a protective tariff on manufactures.[22] Vetoing the Bonus Bill on strict constructionist grounds, Madison nevertheless was determined, as had been his predecessor, Thomas Jefferson,[23] to see internal improvements implemented with an amendment to the US Constitution.[24][25] Writing to Monroe, in 1817, Madison declared that \"there has never been a moment when such a proposition to the states was so likely to be approved\".[26].The emergence of \"new Republicans\" \u2013 undismayed by mild nationalist policies \u2013 anticipated Monroe's \"era of good feelings\" and a general mood of optimism emerged with hopes for political reconciliation.[27].Monroe's landslide victory against Federalist Rufus King in the 1816 presidential election was so widely predicted that voter turnout was low.[28][29] A spirit of reconciliation between Republicans and Federalists was well underway when Monroe assumed office in March 1817.[3][30].As president, Monroe was widely expected to facilitate a rapprochement of the political parties in order to harmonize the country in a common national outlook, rather than party interests.", "Mia Hamm": "Mariel Margaret Hamm (born March 17, 1972) is an American former professional soccer player, two-time Olympic gold medalist and two-time FIFA Women's World Cup champion.Hailed as a soccer icon,[2][3][4][5] she played as a forward for the United States national team from 1987 to 2004.Hamm was the face of the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), the first professional women's soccer league in the United States, where she played for the Washington Freedom from 2001 to 2003.She played college soccer for the North Carolina Tar Heels and helped the team win four NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship titles..Hamm competed in four FIFA Women's World Cups: the inaugural 1991 tournament in China, 1995 in Sweden, 1999 and 2003 in the United States.She led the team at three Olympic Games \u2014 1996 in Atlanta (the first time women's soccer was played), 2000 in Sydney, and 2004 in Athens.At these seven international tournaments she played in 42 matches and scored 14 goals..Hamm held the record for most international goals scored until 2013 and remains in third place as of 2023.[6][7][8] She ranks third in the history of the U.S.team for international caps (276) and first for career assists (144).[9] Hamm was named FIFA World Player of the Year in 2001 and 2002.She was chosen by Pel\u00e9 as one of FIFA's 125 greatest living players in the FIFA 100, to celebrate the organization's 100th anniversary.[10] Hamm was named U.S.Soccer Female Athlete of the Year five years in a row, and won three ESPY awards including Soccer Player of the Year and Female Athlete of the Year.[11] The Women's Sports Foundation named her Sportswoman of the Year in 1997 and 1999.She was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame, Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, Texas Sports Hall of Fame, North Carolina Soccer Hall of Fame, and was the first woman inducted into the World Football Hall of Fame.[9].", "New York Red Bulls": "The New York Red Bulls are an American professional soccer club based in the New York metropolitan area.The Red Bulls compete in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Eastern Conference.The club was established in October 1994 and began play in the league's inaugural season in 1996 as the New York/New Jersey MetroStars.In 2006, the team was sold to Red Bull GmbH and re-branded as part of the company's global network of soccer clubs.[5].The Red Bulls have played their home matches at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey since 2010, having previously played at Giants Stadium.The club is one of two teams in MLS based in the New York metropolitan region along with New York City FC, which entered the league in 2015.The two teams compete against each other in the Hudson River Derby.Other rivals include the Philadelphia Union..The Red Bulls have reached the MLS Cup final once in 2008 where they were defeated by the Columbus Crew.The club has won three regular season Supporters' Shield titles in 2013, 2015 and 2018, has also twice reached the final of the U.S.Open Cup in 2003 and 2017, losing on both occasions, and once have reached the semi finals of the CONCACAF Champions League in 2018, losing to Chivas..The club's original name was Empire Soccer Club,[6] which gave birth to the name of the team's largest supporters' group, Empire Supporters Club.[citation needed] The team's original owners were John Kluge and Stuart Subotnick.[6]  The name MetroStars was chosen in reference to Metromedia, the media company founded by Kluge, after Nike's original suggestion \"MetroFlash\"

Buddhist religion, practiced by about 535 million people as of the 2010s,[4] representing 7% to 8% of the world's total population..Buddhism is the official religion in four countries, Bhutan, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka.[5] The religion also holds a special status in two countries, Thailand and Laos..Buddhism is the majority religion in Bhutan, Myanmar (Burma), Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Mongolia, and Laos.It is also the dominant religion in certain nations or territories without any majority religion, such as Mainland China, Hong Kong,[6] Japan[7] Tibet, Macau,[8] Singapore,[9] Taiwan, Kalmykia, and Vietnam.[10] Large Buddhist populations live in North Korea, Nepal, India and South Korea.China is the country with the largest population of Buddhists, approximately 244 million or 18.2% of its total population.[1] They are mostly followers of Chinese schools of Mahayana, making this the largest body of Buddhist traditions..Mahayana, also practised in broader East Asia, is followed by over half of the world's Buddhists.[1] The second largest body of Buddhist schools is Theravada, mostly followed in Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka.[1] The third largest body of schools Vajrayana, is followed mostly in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, Mongolia and parts of Russia,[1] but is disseminated throughout the world.The fourth largest body of Buddhist schools

American Old West known for his life on the frontier as a soldier, scout, lawman, cattle rustler, gunslinger, gambler, showman, and actor, and for his involvement in many famous gunfights.He earned a great deal of notoriety in his own time, much of it bolstered by the many outlandish and often fabricated tales he told about himself.Some contemporaneous reports of his exploits are known to be fictitious, but they remain the basis of much of his fame and reputation..Hickok was born and raised on a farm in northern Illinois at a time when lawlessness and vigilante activity were rampant because of the influence of the \"Banditti of the Prairie\".Drawn to this ruffian lifestyle, he headed west at age 18 as a fugitive from justice, working as a stagecoach driver and later as a lawman in the frontier territories of Kansas and Nebraska.He fought and spied for the Union Army during the American Civil War and gained publicity after the war as a scout, marksman, actor, and professional gambler.He was involved in several notable shootouts during the course of his life..In 1876, Hickok was shot and killed while playing poker in a saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory (present-day South Dakota) by Jack McCall, an unsuccessful gambler.The hand of cards that he supposedly held at the time of his death has become known as the dead man's hand: two pairs; black aces and eights..Hickok remains a popular figure of frontier history.Many historic sites and monuments commemorate his life, and he has been depicted numerous times in literature, film, and television.He is chiefly portrayed as a protagonist, although historical accounts of his actions are often controversial, and much of his career is known to have been exaggerated both by himself and by contemporary mythmakers.", "Mars rover": "A Mars rover is a remote-controlled motor vehicle designed to travel on the surface of Mars.Rovers have several advantages over stationary landers: they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control.They serve a different purpose than orbital spacecraft like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.A more recent development is the Mars helicopter..As of May2021[update], there have been six successful robotically operated Mars rovers; the first five, managed by the American NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, were (by date of Mars landing): Sojourner (1997), Spirit (2004\u20132010), Opportunity (2004\u20132018), Curiosity (2012\u2013present), and Perseverance (2021\u2013present).The sixth, managed by the China National Space Administration, is Zhurong (2021\u20132022)..On January 24, 2016, NASA reported that then current studies on Mars by Opportunity  and Curiosity would be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable.[1][2][3][4][5] The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on Mars is now a primary NASA objective.[1][6].The Soviet probes, Mars 2 and Mars 3, were physically tethered probes; Sojourner was dependent on the Mars Pathfinder base station for communication with Earth; Opportunity, Spirit and Curiosity were on their own.As of February 2023, Curiosity is still active, while Spirit, Opportunity, and Sojourner completed their missions before losing contact.On February 18, 2021, Perseverance, the newest American Mars rover, successfully landed.On May 14, 2021, China's Zhurong became the first non-American rover to successfully operate on Mars..Multiple rovers have been dispatched to Mars:.", "Financial audit": "A financial audit is conducted to provide an opinion whether \"financial statements\" (the information is verified to the extent of reasonable assurance granted) are stated in accordance with specified criteria.Normally, the criteria are international accounting standards, although auditors may conduct audits of financial statements prepared using the cash basis or some other basis of accounting appropriate for the organization.In providing an opinion whether financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting standards, the auditor gathers evidence to determine whether the statements contain material errors or other misstatements.[1].The audit opinion is intended to provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, and/or give a true and fair view in accordance with the financial reporting framework.The purpose of an audit is to provide an objective independent examination of the financial statements, which increases the value and credibility of the financial statements produced by management, thus increase user confidence in the financial statement, reduce investor risk and consequently reduce the cost of capital of the preparer of the financial statements.[2].In accordance with the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), auditors must release an opinion of the overall financial statements in the auditor's report.Auditors can release three types of statements other than an unqualified/unmodified opinion:.Financial audits are typically performed by firms of practicing accountants who are experts in financial reporting.The financial audit is one of many assurance functions provided by accounting firms.Many organizations separately employ or hire internal auditors, who do not attest to financial reports but focus mainly on the internal controls of the organization.External auditors may choose to place limited reliance on the work of internal auditors.Auditing promotes transparency and accuracy in the financial disclosures made by an organization, therefore would likely reduce such corporations concealment of unscrupulous dealings.[4].", "Dollar coin (United States)": "The dollar coin is a United States coin with a face value of one United States dollar.Dollar coins have been minted in the United States in gold, silver, and base metal versions.Dollar coins were first minted  in the United States in 1794..While true gold dollars are no longer minted, the Sacagawea, Presidential, and American Innovation dollars are sometimes referred to as golden dollars because of their color.As with several other denominations of U.S.coinage, golden dollars are similar in diameter and color to their Canadian counterpart (known as the \"loonie\", which predates the Sacagawea dollar by thirteen years).However, unlike the 11-sided Canadian dollar coins, U.S.\"golden dollar\" coins are round..Dollar coins have never been popular in circulation since their inception.Despite efforts by the U.S.government to promote their use to save the cost of printing one dollar bills, the Anthony Dollar, the Sacagawea Dollar and the Presidential Dollar Series are all seldom seen in circulation, since most Americans prefer to use the dollar bill.[1] For this reason, since December 11, 2011, the Mint has not produced dollar coins for general circulation, and all dollar coins produced after that date have been specifically for collectors.These collector coins can be ordered directly from the Mint, while pre-2012 circulation dollars can be obtained from most U.S.", "G-force": "The g-force or gravitational force equivalent is mass-specific force (force per unit mass), expressed in units of standard gravity (g, not to be confused with \"g\", the symbol for grams)..It is used for sustained accelerations, that cause a perception of weight.For example, an object at rest on Earth's surface is subject to 1 g, equaling the conventional value of gravitational acceleration on Earth, about 9.8m/s2.[1].More transient acceleration, accompanied with significant jerk, is called shock..When the g-force is produced by the surface of one object being pushed by the surface of another object, the reaction force to this push produces an equal and opposite force for every unit of each object's mass.The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses.Gravitational acceleration is one cause of an object's acceleration in relation to free fall.[2][3].The g-force experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of all gravitational and non-gravitational forces acting on an object's freedom to move.In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects.Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface.Because of these strains, large g-forces may be destructive..For example, a force of 1g on an object sitting on the Earth's surface is caused by the mechanical force exerted in the upward direction by the ground, keeping the object from going into free fall.", "Augur": "An augur was a priest and official in the classical Roman world.His main role was the practice of augury, the interpretation of the will of the gods by studying events he observed within a predetermined sacred space (templum).The templum corresponded to the heavenly space above.The augur's decisions were based on what he personally saw or heard from within the templum; they included thunder, lightning and any accidental signs such as falling objects, but in particular, birdsigns; whether the birds he saw flew in groups or alone, what noises they made as they flew, the direction of flight, what kind of birds they were, how many there were, or how they fed.This practice was known as \"taking the auspices\".As circumstance did not always favour the convenient appearance of wild birds or weather phenomena, domesticated chickens kept for the purpose were sometimes released into the templum, where their behaviour, particularly how they fed, could be studied by the augur.[1].The augural ceremony and function of the augur was central to any major undertaking in Roman society \u2013 public or private \u2013 including matters of war, commerce, and religion.Augurs sought the divine will regarding any proposed course of action which might affect Rome's pax, fortuna, and salus (peace, good fortune, and well-being).[2].Although ancient authors believed that the term \"augur\" contained the words avis and ger\u014d \u2013 Latin for \"directing the birds\", historical-linguistic evidence points instead to the root auge\u014d: \"to increase, to prosper\".[citation needed].Political, military and civil actions were sanctioned by augury and by haruspices..Historically, augury was performed by priests of the college of augurs on behalf of senior magistrates.The practice itself likely comes from the neighboring region of Etruria, where augurs were highly respected as officials.", "Farmington Hills, Michigan": "Farmington Hills is a city in Oakland County in the U.S.state of Michigan.A northwestern suburb of Detroit, Farmington Hills is located roughly 22 miles (35.4km) from downtown Detroit.As of the 2020 census, the city's population was 83,986, making it the second-largest community in Oakland County.[3].Farmington Hills consistently ranks as one of the safest cities in the United States, as well as in the state of Michigan.The area ranked as the 30th safest city in the U.S.in 2010 and as the 2nd safest city in Michigan in 2020.[4][5][6] Farmington Hills also ranks as the 36th highest-income place in the United States with a population of 50,000 or more and ranked as 14th America's best cities to live by 24/7 Wall St.in 2016.[7].Although the two cities have separate services and addresses, Farmington and Farmington Hills are often thought of as the same community.These two cities combined were part of Farmington Township in the time of the Northwest Territory.Features of the community include a recently renovated downtown, boutiques, a vintage cinema, numerous restaurants, exotic car dealerships, art galleries, and public parks including Heritage Park.There are several historical sites including the Longacre House and the Governor Warner Mansion.", "Seal (emblem)": "A seal is a device for making an impression in wax, clay, paper, or some other medium, including an embossment on paper, and is also the impression thus made.The original purpose was to authenticate a document, or to prevent interference with a package or envelope by applying a seal which had to be broken to open the container (hence the modern English verb \"to seal\", which implies secure closing without an actual wax seal)..The seal-making device is also referred to as the seal matrix or die; the imprint it creates as the seal impression (or, more rarely, the sealing).[1] If the impression is made purely as a relief resulting from the greater pressure on the paper where the high parts of the matrix touch, the seal is known as a dry seal; in other cases ink or another liquid or liquefied medium is used, in another color than the paper..In most traditional forms of dry seal the design on the seal matrix is in intaglio (cut below the flat surface) and therefore the design on the impressions made is in relief (raised above the surface).The design on the impression will reverse (be a mirror-image of) that of the matrix, which is especially important when script is included in the design, as it very often is.This will not be the case if paper is embossed from behind, where the matrix and impression read the same way, and both matrix and impression are in relief.However engraved gems were often carved in relief, called cameo in this context, giving a \"counter-relief\" or intaglio impression when used as seals.The process is essentially that of a mould..Most seals have always given a single impression on an essentially flat surface, but in medieval Europe two-sided seals with two matrices were often used by institutions or rulers (such as towns, bishops and kings) to make two-sided or fully three-dimensional impressions in wax, with a \"tag\", a piece of ribbon or strip of parchment, running through them.These \"pendent\" seal impressions dangled below the documents they authenticated, to which the attachment tag was sewn or otherwise attached (single-sided seals were treated in the same way)..Some jurisdictions consider rubber stamps[2] or specified signature-accompanying words such as \"seal\" or \"L.S.\" (abbreviation of locus sigilli, \"place of the seal\") to be the legal equivalent of, i.e., an equally effective substitute for, a seal.[3].In the United States, the word \"seal\" is sometimes assigned to a facsimile of the seal design (in monochrome or color), which may be used in a variety of contexts including architectural settings, on flags, or on official letterheads.", "Groundhog Day": "Groundhog Day (Pennsylvania German: Grund'sau d\u00e5k, Grundsaudaag, Grundsow Dawg, Murmeltiertag; Nova Scotia: Daks Day)[1] is a tradition observed in the United States and Canada on February 2 of every year starting in the 16th century.[citation needed] It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and sees its shadow, it will retreat to its den and winter will go on for six more weeks; if it does not see its shadow, spring will arrive early..While the tradition remains popular in the 21st century, studies have found no consistent association between a groundhog seeing its shadow and the subsequent arrival time of spring-like weather.[2].The weather lore was brought from German-speaking areas where the badger (German: Dachs) is the forecasting animal.It is related to the lore that clear weather on the Christian festival of Candlemas forebodes a prolonged winter..The Groundhog Day ceremony held at Punxsutawney in western Pennsylvania, centering on a semi-mythical groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil, has become the most frequently attended ceremony.Grundsow Lodges in Pennsylvania Dutch Country in the southeastern part of the state observe the occasion as well.Other cities in the United States and Canada also have adopted the event..The Pennsylvania Dutch were immigrants from German-speaking areas of Europe.The Germans had a tradition of marking Candlemas (February 2) as \"Badger Day\" (Dachstag), on which if a badger emerging from its den encountered a sunny day, thereby casting a shadow, it presaged four more weeks of winter..Candlemas is a primarily Catholic festival but also known in the German Protestant (Lutheran) churches.In folk religion, various traditions and superstitions continue to be linked with the holiday, although this was discouraged by the Protestant Reformers in the 16th century.[3] Notably, several traditions that are part of weather lore use the weather at Candlemas to predict the start of spring..The weather-predicting animal on Candlemas was usually the badger, although regionally, the animal was the bear or the fox.[4] The original weather-predicting animal in Germany had been the bear, another hibernating mammal, but when they grew scarce, the lore became altered.[5].", "Climate of the Tampa Bay area": "The Tampa Bay area has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), closely bordering a tropical climate near the waterfront areas.There are two basic seasons in the Tampa Bay area, a hot and wet season from May through October, and a mild and dry season from November through April..Nearly two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls in the months of June through September.The area is listed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as being in hardiness zone 9b as well as hardiness zone 10a just along the immediate coast and in peninsular Pinellas;[1] which is about the northern limit of where coconut palms and royal palms can be grown.Highs usually range between 65 and 95\u00b0F (18\u201335\u00b0C) year round.Tampa's official high has never reached 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) \u2013 the city's all-time record temperature is 99\u00b0F (37\u00b0C).St.Petersburg's all-time record high is exactly 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C).[2].Pinellas County lies on a peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, and much of the city of Tampa lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay.This proximity to large bodies of water both moderates temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere.In general, the local communities farthest from the coast have larger temperature ranges, both during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year.[3].The warm and rainy season typically begins in late May and runs through October.[5] Average high temperatures are in the low 90s \u00b0F (around 32\u00b0C) with lows in the mid-70s \u00b0F (around 24\u00b0C) during this period, and the combination of warm temperatures and high humidity brings an almost daily chance of rain and thunderstorms, especially in the afternoon.", "Electromagnetic spectrum": "The electromagnetic spectrum is the  spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, ranging over a domain of frequencies and their respective wavelengths and photon energies..It covers electromagnetic waves with frequencies ranging from below one hertz to above 1025 hertz, corresponding to wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus.This range is divided into separate bands, and the electromagnetic waves within each band are called by different names; beginning at the low-frequency (long-wavelength) end of the spectrum these are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays at the high-frequency (short wavelength) end..The electromagnetic waves in each of these bands have different characteristics, such as how they are produced, how they interact with matter, and their practical applications.There is no known limit for long and short wavelengths.Extreme ultraviolet, soft X-rays, hard X-rays and gamma rays are  classified as ionizing radiation because their photons have enough energy to ionize atoms, causing chemical reactions.Radiation of visible light and longer wavelengths are classified as nonionizing radiation because they have insufficient energy to cause these effects..Throughout most of the electromagnetic spectrum, spectroscopy can be used to separate waves of different frequencies, producing a spectrum of the constituent frequencies.Spectroscopy is used to study the interactions of electromagnetic waves with matter.[1].Humans have always been aware of visible light and radiant heat but for most of history it was not known that these phenomena were connected or were representatives of a more extensive principle.The ancient Greeks recognized that light traveled in straight lines and studied some of its properties, including reflection and refraction.Light was intensively studied from the beginning of the 17th century leading to the invention of important instruments like the telescope and microscope.", "Franklin D. Roosevelt": "Franklin Delano Roosevelt[a] (January 30, 1882\u2013 April 12, 1945), commonly known by his initials FDR, was an American politician and statesman who served as the 32nd president of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945.He was a member of the Democratic Party and is the only U.S.president to have served more than eight years in office.His third and fourth terms were dominated by the ultimately successful prosecution of World War II..A member of the prominent Roosevelt family, after attending university, Roosevelt began to practice law in New York City.He was elected a member of the New York State Senate from 1911 to 1913 and was then the assistant secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I.Roosevelt was James M.Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's ticket in the 1920 U.S.presidential election, but Cox lost to Republican nominee Warren G.Harding.In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness that permanently paralyzed his legs.Partly through the encouragement of his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, he returned to public office as governor of New York from 1929 to 1933, during which he promoted programs to combat the Great Depression besetting the U.S.", "Joint committee": "", "Prostitution in the United States": "Prostitution is illegal in the vast majority of the United States as a result of state laws rather than federal laws.It is, however, legal in some rural counties within the state of Nevada.Additionally, it is decriminalized in the state of Maine.Prostitution nevertheless occurs elsewhere in the country..The regulation of prostitution in the country is not among the enumerated powers of the federal government.It is therefore exclusively the domain of the states to permit, prohibit, or otherwise regulate commercial sex under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, except insofar as Congress may regulate it as part of interstate commerce with laws such as the Mann Act.In most states, prostitution is considered a misdemeanor in the category of public order crime\u2013crime that disrupts the order of a community.Prostitution was once considered a vagrancy crime..Currently, Nevada is the only U.S.state to allow legal prostitution \u2013 in the form of regulated brothels \u2013 the terms of which are stipulated in the Nevada Revised Statutes.In addition, it is decriminalized in Maine..Only these six counties currently contain active brothels: Elko, Lyon, Nye, White Pine, Lander & Storey.[1].", "Flag of the United States": "The national flag of the United States, often referred to as the American flag or the U.S.flag, consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom) alternating with white, with a blue rectangle in the canton, referred to as the union and bearing fifty small, white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows, where rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternate with rows of five stars.The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 U.S.states, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from Great Britain, which they obtained in their victory in the American Revolutionary War.[1].During the Revolutionary War era, the \"Rebellious Stripes\" were considered as the most important element of United States flag designs, and were always mentioned before the stars.The \"Stripes and Stars\" was a popular phrase into the 19th century.Credit for the term \"Stars and Stripes\" has been given to the Marquis de Lafayette, a French soldier who volunteered his aid to the Continental Army, led by George Washington, in the Revolutionary War against Britain.[2].Nicknames for the flag include the Stars and Stripes,[3] Old Glory, and The Star-Spangled Banner..The current design of the U.S.flag is its 27th; the design of the flag has been modified officially 26 times since 1777.The 48-star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49-star version became official on July 4, 1959.The 50-star flag was ordered by then president Eisenhower on August 21, 1959, and was adopted in July 1960.", "States and territories of India": "India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories,[1] for a total of 36 entities.The states and union territories are further subdivided into districts and smaller administrative divisions..The states of India are self-governing administrative divisions, each having a state government.The governing powers of the states are shared between the state government and the union government.On the other hand, the union territories are directly governed by the union government.Though some of the union territories have their own territorial government, they do not have police forces..The Indian Empire was a very complex political entity consisting of various imperial divisions and states and territories of varying autonomy.At the time of its establishment in 1876, it was made up of 584 constituent states and the directly ruled territories of the Crown.The entire empire was divided into provinces and agencies..A province consisted of territory under the direct rule of the Emperor of India (who was also the King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions) and a few minor states, ruled by Indian princes under the suzerainty of the Emperor.A Governor or Lieutenant-Governor acted as the representative of the Emperor to that province and head of government of the directly ruled territories in the province.The governor or lieutenant-governor also served as the Emperor's representative to the constituent states of the province.", "List of United States congressional districts": "Congressional districts in the United States are electoral divisions for the purpose of electing members of the United States House of Representatives.The number of voting seats in the House of Representatives is currently set at 435, with each one representing an average of 761,179 people following the 2020 United States census.[1] The  number of voting seats has applied since 1913, excluding a temporary increase to 437 after the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii.The total number of state members is capped by the Reapportionment Act of 1929.[2] In addition, each of the five inhabited U.S.territories and the federal district of Washington, D.C., sends a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives..The Bureau of the Census conducts a constitutionally mandated decennial census whose figures are used to determine the number of congressional districts to which each state is entitled, in a process called \"apportionment\".The 2022 elections were the first to be based on the congressional districts which were defined based on the 2020 United States census.[3].Each state is responsible for the redistricting of districts within their state, while several states have one \"at-large\" division.Redistricting must take place if the number of members changes following a re-apportionment, or may take place at any other time if demographics represented in a district have changed substantially.Setting the boundaries of states' congressional districts is the responsibility of state governments, who often gerrymander districts for various reasons.Districts may sometimes retain the same boundaries, while changing their district numbers..The following is a complete list of the 435 current congressional districts for the House of Representatives, and over 200 obsolete districts, and the six current and one obsolete non-voting delegations..", "Mariah Carey": "Mariah Carey (/m\u0259\u02c8ra\u026a\u0259/; born March 27, 1969)[a] is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress.Referred to as the \"Songbird Supreme\" by Guinness World Records, she is noted for her songwriting, five-octave vocal range, melismatic singing style and signature use of the whistle register.An influential figure in popular music, Carey is credited for impacting the vocal style in contemporary music, merging hip-hop with pop music through her collaborations and popularizing the use of remixes.She has also been dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\" for the enduring popularity of her holiday music, particularly the 1994 song \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", which is the best-selling holiday song by a female artist..Carey rose to fame in 1990 with her eponymous debut album under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, who she married in 1993.She is the only artist to date to have their first five singles reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100, from \"Vision of Love\" to \"Emotions\".Carey gained worldwide success with the albums Music Box (1993) and Daydream (1995) \u2015 both of which rank among the best-selling albums and spawned singles such as \"Dreamlover\", \"Hero\", \"Without You\", \"Fantasy\", \"Always Be My Baby\" and \"One Sweet Day\".The lattermost of these topped the US Billboard Hot 100 decade-end chart (1990s).After separating from Mottola, she adopted a new urban image and began incorporating hip-hop and R&B elements, with the release of Butterfly (1997).By the end of the 1990s, Billboard named her the most successful artist of the decade in the United States.She left Columbia in 2001 after eleven consecutive years of US number-one singles and signed a record deal with Virgin Records..Following Carey's highly publicized breakdown and the failure of the film Glitter (2001) and its soundtrack, Virgin bought out her contract and she signed with Island Records the following year.", "Cloud": "In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of miniature liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space.[1] Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals.On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature..Clouds are seen in the Earth's homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere.Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common name..Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names because of the universal adoption of Luke Howard's nomenclature that was formally proposed in 1802.It became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms which can be further divided or classified into altitude levels to derive ten basic genera.The main representative cloud types for each of these forms are stratiform, cumuliform, stratocumuliform, cumulonimbiform, and cirriform.Low-level  clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes.However mid-level stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix alto- while high-level variants of these same two forms carry the prefix cirro-.In both cases, strato- is dropped from the latter form to avoid double-prefixing.Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one level do not carry any altitude-related prefixes.", "Galveston County, Texas": "Galveston County (/\u02c8\u0261\u00e6lv\u026ast\u0259n/ GAL-vis-t\u0259n) is a county in the U.S.state of Texas, located along the Gulf Coast adjacent to Galveston Bay.As of the 2020 census, its population was 350,682.[1] The county was founded in 1838.The county seat is the City of Galveston, founded the following year, and located on Galveston Island.The most-populous municipality in the county is League City, a suburb of Houston at the northern end of the county, which surpassed Galveston in population during the early 2000s.[2].Galveston County is part of the nine-county Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land (Greater Houston) metropolitan statistical area..Sixteenth-century Spanish explorers knew Galveston Island as the Isla de Malhado, the \"Isle of Misfortune\", or Isla de Culebras, the \"Isle of Snakes\".[3] In 1519, an expedition led by Alonso \u00c1lvarez de Pineda actually sailed past Galveston Island while charting the route from the Florida peninsula to the P\u00e1nuco River.The information gathered from the expedition enabled the Spanish government to establish control over the entire Gulf Coast, including Galveston Island.In 1783, Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Evia, a Spanish navigator, surveyed the area and named the bay \"Galveston\" to honor Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez, who supported the United States in the Revolutionary War.[4].Galveston County was formally established under the Republic of Texas on May 15, 1838.[5]  The county was formed from territory taken from Harrisburg, Liberty, and Brazoria Counties, with governmental organization taking place in 1839.[6] The island and city of Galveston by far formed the most important population center.The city of Galveston was the republic's largest city and its center of commerce and culture.The Galveston County Bar Association, first formed in 1846, is the oldest in Texas.[7] Port Bolivar on the Bolivar Peninsula was a port of secondary importance.", "List of cities in the Bahamas": "Download coordinates as:.This is a list of cities in the Bahamas..The following table lists the city or town name, the geographic coordinates, the

Ten Conference (stylized B1G, formerly the Western Conference and the Big Nine Conference) is the oldest Division I collegiate athletic conference in the United States.Founded as the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives in 1896, it predates the founding of its regulating organization, the NCAA.It is based in the Chicago area in Rosemont, Illinois.For many decades the conference consisted of 10 prominent universities (which accounts for its name).As of 2014[update], it consists of 14 member institutions and 2 affiliate institutions, with 4 new member institutions scheduled to join in 2024.[1][2] The conference competes in the NCAA Division I and its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport..Big Ten member institutions are major research universities with large financial endowments and strong academic reputations.A large student body is a hallmark of its universities, as 12 of the 14 members enroll more than 30,000 students.They are all public universities except founding member Northwestern University as the lone private university, but will be joined by private University of Southern California at the beginning of the 2024\u201325 collegiate athletic year.Collectively, Big Ten universities educate more than 520,000 total students and have 5.7 million living alumni.[1] The members engage in $9.3 billion in funded research each year;[2] 13 out of 14 are members of the Association of American Universities and all are members of the Universities Research Association (URA).All Big Ten universities are also members of the Big Ten Academic Alliance, formerly the Committee on Institutional Cooperation.[3].Though the Big Ten existed for nearly a century based in the Midwest, since 2014 the conference's geographic footprint stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Plains and in 2024 will extend to the Pacific Ocean.The conference has maintained its historic name while expanding to 14 members and 2 affiliate members.[4].", "Single malt Scotch": "Single malt Scotch refers to single malt whisky made in Scotland.[1][2] To qualify for this category, a whisky must have been distilled at a single distillery using a pot still distillation process[3][4] and made from a mash of malted barley.Therefore, a single malt means that the whisky has not been blended elsewhere with whisky from other distilleries.[4] As with any Scotch whisky, a single malt Scotch must be distilled in Scotland and matured in oak casks in Scotland for at least three years, although most single malts are matured longer.[1][2].Another term is sometimes seen, \"double malt Scotch\" or \"triple malt\".This designation indicates that the whisky was aged in two or three types of casks, but was not blended; hence, it still falls into the single malt category.The more common term for this type of whisky is \"double wood\" or \"triple wood\".Examples include The Balvenie 12 Years Old DoubleWood and Laphroaig Triple Wood.[6].Many companies use malt whisky purchased from multiple distilleries, and these whiskies combined into \"blended malt\".[5].Until the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 (SWR 2009), the word \"blended\" only appeared (in the context of Scotch whisky) on bottles of whisky that contained a mixture of both barley and non-barley grain whisky, but this is no longer the case.Under the terminology established by the SWR 2009, the term \"blended malt Scotch whisky\" replaced the term \"vatted malt\" to describe a mixture of single malt Scotch whiskies (malted barley whisky)..Only about 10% of the Scotch whiskies on the market are defined as single malt.[2] The other 90% is made by combining numerous whiskies, typically two-thirds grain whisky (non-barley) and one-third malt whisky, from several, or numerous, distilleries in Scotland.The resulting products are labeled \"blended Scotch whisky\", without the word \"malt\".[5] Nearly 90% of Scotch whisky sold each year is a blended type.[2] Nonetheless, in 2018, single malt Scotch made up nearly 28% of the \u00a34.7 billion of whisky exported from Scotland.[7].For any Scotch whisky, whether malt or blended, the age statement on a bottle refers to the number of years the whisky spent maturing in casks.", "Sound mass": "In musical composition, a sound mass (also sound collective, sound complex, tone shower, sound crowd, or cloud)[citation needed] is the result of compositional techniques, in which, \"the importance of individual pitches\", is minimized, \"in preference for texture, timbre, and dynamics as primary shapers of gesture and impact\", obscuring, \"the boundary between sound and noise\".[2].Techniques which may create or be used with sound mass include extended techniques such as muted brass or strings, flutter tonguing, wide vibrato, extreme ranges, and glissandos as the continuum for \"sound mass\" moves from simultaneously sounding notes \u2013 clusters etc., towards stochastic cloud textures, and 'mass structure' compositional textures which evolve over time.[2] In a sound mass, \"the traditional concept of 'chord' or vertical 'event' [is] replaced by a shifting, iridescent fabric of sound\".[3].The use of \"chords approaching timbres\" begins with Debussy and Edgard Var\u00e8se often carefully scored individual instrumental parts so that they would fuse into one ensemble timbre or sound mass.[4] Explored by Charles Ives and Henry Cowell in the early part of the twentieth century, this technique also developed from the modernist tone clusters and spread to orchestral writing by the mid 1950s and 1960s.[2] \"Unlike most tonal and non-tonal linear dissonances, tone clusters are essentially static.The individual pitches are of secondary importance; it is the sound mass that is foremost.\"[5] One French composer active in this period whose music takes a sound-mass approach directly influenced by both Debussy and Var\u00e8se is Maurice Ohana.[6].Examples can be found in Metastasis (1953\u201354), Pithoprakta (1955\u201356), and Achorripsis (1956\u201357), all orchestral works by Iannis Xenakis,[7] as well as in Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge for concrete and electronic sounds (1955\u201356), Zeitma\u00dfe for five woodwinds (1955\u201356), and Gruppen for three orchestras (1955\u201357), by Karlheinz Stockhausen.[8] Other composers and works include Barbara Kolb, Pauline Oliveros' Sound Patterns for chorus (1961), Norma Beecroft's From Dreams of Brass for chorus (1963\u201364), and Nancy Van de Vate.Beecroft \"blurs individual pitches in favor of a collective timbre through the use of vocal and instrumental clusters, choral speech, narrator, and a wash of sounds from an electronic tape\".[2].A very early example is the opening of Jean-F\u00e9ry Rebel's ballet Les El\u00e9mens (1737\u201338), where chaos is represented by a gradually cumulating orchestral cluster of all seven notes of the D minor scale.[9] A later example is the third movement of Ruth Crawford Seeger's String Quartet 1931[10][citation needed] while more recently Phill Niblock's multiple drone based music serves as an example.[11].Other examples include European \"textural\" compositions of the fifties and sixties such as Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1959) and Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's works featuring micropolyphony in works like Atmosph\u00e8res (1961) and his Requiem (1963\u201365).[12] Other composers with works using this technique include Henryk G\u00f3recki, Karel Husa, Witold Lutos\u0142awski, Kazimierz Serocki, Steven Stucky, and George Crumb.[12] Sound-mass techniques also appear in the music of Monic Cecconi-Botella[13] and Harry Freedman.[14].Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate.HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload file.Create accountLog

secondary school or higher (e.g., college or university); those in primary or elementary schools are \"pupils\".[2].In Nigeria, education is classified into four systems known as a 6-3-3-4 system of education.It implies six years in primary school, three years in junior secondary, three years in senior secondary and four years in the university.However, the number of years to be spent in university is mostly determined by the course of study.Some courses have longer study lengths than others.Those in primary school are often referred to as pupils.Those in university, as well as those in secondary school, are referred to as students.[3].The Nigerian system of education also has other recognized categories like the polytechnics and colleges of education.The Polytechnic gives out National Diploma and Higher National Diploma certifications after two years and/or four years of study respectively..A higher National Diploma (also known as HND) can be obtained in a different institution from where the National Diploma (also known as ND or OND) was obtained.However, the HND cannot be obtained without the OND certificate..", "Australia (continent)": "The continent of Australia, sometimes known in technical contexts by the names Sahul (/s\u0259\u02c8hu\u02d0l/), Australia-New Guinea, Australinea, Meganesia, or Papualand[citation needed] to distinguish it from the country of Australia, is located within the Southern and Eastern hemispheres.[1] The name \"Sahul\" takes its name from the Sahul Shelf, which is a part of the continental shelf of the Australian continent.The continent includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, the island of New Guinea (Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea), the Aru Islands, the Ashmore and Cartier Islands, most of the Coral Sea Islands, and some other nearby islands.Situated in the geographical region of Oceania, Australia is the smallest of the seven traditional continents..The continent includes a continental shelf overlain by shallow seas which divide it into several landmasses\u2014the Arafura Sea and Torres Strait between mainland Australia and New Guinea, and Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania.When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice age, including the Last Glacial Maximum about 18,000 BC, they were connected by dry land.During the past 18,000 to 10,000 years, rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands and separated the continent into today's low-lying arid to semi-arid mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea and Tasmania..With a total land area of 8.56million square kilometres (3,310,000sqmi), the Australian continent is the smallest, lowest, flattest, and second-driest continent (after Antarctica) on Earth.[2] As the country of Australia is mostly on a single landmass, and comprises most of the continent, it is sometimes informally referred to as an island continent, surrounded by oceans.[3].Papua New Guinea, a country within the continent, is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse countries in the world.[4] It is also one of the most rural, as only 18 percent of its people live in urban centres.[5] West Papua, a province of Indonesia, is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.[6] Australia, the largest landmass in the continent, is highly urbanised,[7] and has the world's 14th-largest economy with the second-highest human development index globally.[8][9] Australia also has the world's 9th largest immigrant population.[10][11].The continent of Australia is sometimes known by the names Sahul, Australinea, or Meganesia to distinguish it from the country of Australia, and consists of the landmasses which sit on Australia's continental plate.This includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, and the island of New Guinea, which comprises Papua New Guinea and  Western New Guinea (Papua and West Papua, provinces of Indonesia).[12][13][14][15] The name \"Sahul\" takes its name from the Sahul Shelf, which is part of the continental shelf of the Australian continent..The term Oceania, originally a \"great division\" of the world in the 1810s, was replaced in English language countries by the concept of Australia as one of the world's continents in the 1950s.[16] Prior to the 1950s, before the popularization of the theory of plate tectonics, Antarctica, Australia and Greenland were sometimes described as island continents, but none were usually taught as one of the world's continents in English-speaking countries.[17][18][16] Scottish cartographer John Bartholomew wrote in 1873 that, \"the New World consists of North America, and the peninsula of South America attached to it.These divisions [are] generally themselves spoken as continents, and to them has been added another, embracing the large island of Australia and numerous others in the [Pacific] Ocean, under the name of Oceania.", "Environmental issues in New York City": "Environmental issues in New York City are  affected by the city's size, density, abundant public transportation infrastructure, and location at the mouth of the Hudson River..New York's population density has environmental pros and cons.It facilitates the highest mass transit use in the United States, but also concentrates pollution.Gasoline consumption in the city is at the rate the national average was in the 1920s,[1] and greenhouse gas emissions are a fraction of the national average, at 7.1 metric tons per person per year, below San Francisco, at 11.2 metric tons, and the national average, at 24.5 metric tons.[2] New York City accounts for only 1% of United States greenhouse gas emissions while housing 2.7% of its population.[2].In September 2012, New York was named the #1 \"America's Dirtiest City,\" by a Travel+Leisure readership survey that rated the environmental quality of 35 prominent cities in the United States.Governors Island in New York Harbor is planned to host a US$1 billion research and education center poised to make New York City the global leader in addressing the climate crisis.[3].Environmental concerns in the city involve managing the city's extraordinary population density.Mass transit use is the highest in the nation and gasoline consumption in the city is at the rate the national average was in the 1920s.[1] New York City's dense population and low automobile dependence help make New York among the most energy efficient in the United States.[4] The city's greenhouse gas emission levels are relatively low when measured per capita, at 7.1 metric tons per person, below San Francisco, at 11.2 metric tons, and the national average, at 24.5.[2]  New Yorkers are collectively responsible for one percent of the nation's total greenhouse gas emissions,[2] though comprise 2.7% of the nation's population.The average New Yorker consumes less than half the electricity used by a resident of San Francisco and nearly one-quarter the electricity consumed by a resident of Dallas.[5].Concentrated pollution in New York City leads to high incidence of asthma and other respiratory conditions among the city's residents.[6]  In recent years the city has focused on reducing its environmental impact.The city government is required to purchase only the most energy-efficient equipment for use in city offices and public housing.[7] New York has the largest clean air diesel-hybrid and compressed natural gas bus fleet in the country, and some of the first hybrid taxis.[8] The city is also a leader in the construction of energy-efficient green office buildings, including the Hearst Tower among others.[9].As of 2005[update], the city has focused on reducing its environmental impact.", "Atlanta": "Atlanta (/\u00e6t\u02c8l\u00e6nt\u0259/ at-LAN-t\u0259, or /\u00e6t\u02c8l\u00e6n\u0259/ at-LAN-\u0259) is the capital and most populous city of the U.S.state of Georgia.It is the seat of Fulton County, although a portion of the city extends into neighboring DeKalb County.With a population of 498,715 living within the city limits, Atlanta is the eighth most populous city in the Southeast and 38th most populous city in the United States according to the 2020 U.S.census.[9] It is the core of the much larger Atlanta metropolitan area, which is home to more than 6.2 million people (2022 estimate), making it the eighth-largest U.S.metropolitan area.[11] Situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains at an elevation of just over 1,000 feet (300m) above sea level, Atlanta features unique topography that includes rolling hills, lush greenery, and the densest urban tree coverage of any major city in the United States.[13].Atlanta was originally founded as the terminus of a major state-sponsored railroad, but it soon became the convergence point among several railroads, spurring its rapid growth.The largest was the Western and Atlantic Railroad, from which the name \"Atlanta\" is derived, signifying the city's growing reputation as a major hub of transportation.[14] During the American Civil War, it served a strategically important role for the Confederacy until it was captured in 1864.The city was almost entirely burned to the ground during General William T.Sherman's March to the Sea.However, the city rebounded dramatically in the post-war period and quickly became a national industrial center and the unofficial capital of the \"New South\".After World War II, it also became a manufacturing and technology hub.[15] During the 1950s and 1960s, it became a major organizing center of the American Civil Rights Movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph David Abernathy, and many other locals becoming prominent figures in the movement's leadership.[16] In the modern era, Atlanta has remained a major center of transportation, with Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport becoming the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic in 1998 (a position it has held every year since, except for 2020), with an estimated 93.7 million passengers in 2022.[17][18][19][20].", "McCarthyism": "McCarthyism, also known as the second Red Scare, was the political repression and persecution of left-wing individuals and a campaign spreading fear of alleged communist and Soviet influence on American institutions and of Soviet espionage in the United States during the late 1940s through the 1950s.[1] After the mid-1950s, U.S.Senator Joseph McCarthy, who had spearheaded the campaign, gradually lost his public popularity and credibility after several of his accusations were found to be false.[2][3] The U.S.Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren made a series of rulings on civil and political rights that overturned several key laws and legislative directives, and helped bring an end to the Second Red Scare.[4][5][6] Historians have suggested since the 1980s that as McCarthy's involvement was less central than that of others, a different and more accurate term should be used instead that more accurately conveys the breadth of the phenomenon, and that the term McCarthyism is now outdated.Ellen Schrecker has suggested that Hooverism after FBI Head J.Edgar Hoover is more appropriate.[7].What would become known as the McCarthy era began before McCarthy's rise to national fame.Following the breakdown of the wartime East-West alliance with the Soviet Union, and with many remembering the First Red Scare, President Harry S.Truman signed an executive order in 1947 to screen federal employees for possible association with organizations deemed \"totalitarian, fascist, communist, or subversive\", or advocating \"to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means.\" The following year, the Czechoslovak coup by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia heightened concern in the West about Communist parties seizing power and the possibility of subversion.In 1949, a high-level State Department official was convicted of perjury in a case of espionage, and the Soviet Union tested a nuclear bomb.The Korean War started the next year, significantly raising tensions and fears of impending communist upheavals in the United States.In a speech in February 1950, McCarthy claimed to have a list of members of the Communist Party USA working in the State Department, which attracted substantial press attention, and the term McCarthyism was published for the first time in late March of that year in The Christian Science Monitor, along with a political cartoon by Herblock in The Washington Post.The term has since taken on a broader meaning, describing the excesses of similar efforts to crack down on alleged \"subversive\" elements.", "Napoleon (Animal Farm)": "Napoleon is a fictional character and the main antagonist of George Orwell's 1945 novel Animal Farm.[2]  While he is at first a common farm pig, he exiles Snowball, another pig, who is his rival for power, and then takes advantage of the animals' uprising against their masters to eventually become the tyrannical \"President\" of Animal Farm, which he turns into a dictatorship.Napoleon's greatest crime, however, is his complete transformation into Mr.Jones (original owner of Animal Farm)..Napoleon was based on Joseph Stalin,[3] who ruled the Soviet Union from 1924 to 1953.He is presumed to be named after the French emperor Napoleon.Napoleon and Snowball mirror the relationship between Stalin and Leon Trotsky.Trotsky supported Permanent Revolution (just as Snowball advocated overthrowing other farm owners), while Stalin supported socialism in one country (similar to Napoleon's idea of teaching the animals to use firearms, instead).When it seems Snowball will win the election for his plans, Napoleon calls in the dogs he has raised to chase Snowball from the farm.This is the first time the dogs have been seen since Napoleon took them in and raised them to act as his secret police..Later on, after ostracising Snowball, Napoleon orders the construction of the windmill, which had been designed by Snowball and which Napoleon had opposed vigorously (just as Stalin opposed Trotsky's push for large scale industrialisation, then adopted it as a policy when Trotsky was in exile), so as to show the animals that he could be just as inventive as Snowball.The other animals are told it was Napoleon's ideas and that Snowball had stolen it.When the primitive windmill collapses after a storm, due to Napoleon's poor planning (a reference to Stalin's backward approach to the Five-Year Plans), Napoleon blames Snowball and starts a wave of terror (a reference to the Great Purge).", "Neptune": "Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun.It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.It is 17times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface.The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5billion kilometres; 2.8billion miles).It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol , representing Neptune's trident.[d].Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical predictions rather than by empirical observation.Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet.After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier.Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier.Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 14 known moons were located telescopically until the 20thcentury.", "Dodge Coronet": "The Dodge Coronet is an automobile that was marketed by Dodge in seven generations, and shared nameplates with the same bodyshell with varying levels of equipment installed.Introduced as a full-size car in 1949, it was the division's highest trim line and moved to the lowest level starting in 1955 through 1959.The name was reintroduced on intermediate-sized models from the 1965 until 1976 model years.[1] Muscle car versions were available starting in 1965 with the 383 and 426 wedge cu in (7.0 L) Chrysler RB engine, followed in 1966 by the powerful 426 cu in (7.0 L) Chrysler Hemi.Other performance models included the \"Superbee\", and featured, the 383 cu in (6.3 L) Magnum, among other engine options.The nameplate \"coronet\" is a type of crown worn by royalty..In the 1980s, the Coronet was used on Dodge models marketed in Colombia..The Dodge Coronet was introduced with the division's first postwar body styles.Lower trim lines were the Wayfarer and Meadowbrook, with the Wayfarer being built on a shorter 115inch wheelbase.[6] The only engine for Dodge was a 230-cubic-inch (3,800cc) flat-head straight six cylinder engine with a single barrel Stromberg carburetor, producing 103hp (77kW) (gross).The stock Dodge Coronet was a smooth-running car, and the six-cylinder engine could power the car to 90mph (145km/h).A limited production model was a four-door, eight-passenger limousine, an extended version of the stock Dodge Coronet which was related to the DeSoto Suburban.[6] One of the most notable features of the first-generation Coronet was Chrysler's four forward-speed, a fluid-driven semi-automatic transmission that Dodge Division called Gyromatic.After using the clutch and gear shift to select the high range, upshifts and downshifts were operated by the accelerator pedal on the floor.The clutch did not need to be depressed in stop-and-go driving once underway.", "ARM9": "ARM9 is a group of 32-bit RISC ARM processor cores licensed by ARM Holdings for microcontroller use.[1]  The ARM9 core family consists of ARM9TDMI, ARM940T, ARM9E-S, ARM966E-S, ARM920T, ARM922T, ARM946E-S, ARM9EJ-S, ARM926EJ-S, ARM968E-S, ARM996HS.Since ARM9 cores were released from 1998 to 2006, they are no longer recommended for new IC designs, instead ARM Cortex-A, ARM Cortex-M, ARM Cortex-R cores are preferred.[1].With this design generation, ARM moved from a von Neumann architecture (Princeton architecture) to a (modified; meaning split cache) Harvard architecture with separate instruction and data buses (and caches), significantly increasing its potential speed.[2] Most silicon chips integrating these cores will package them as modified Harvard architecture chips, combining the two address buses on the other side of separated CPU caches and tightly coupled memories..There are two subfamilies, implementing different ARM architecture versions..Key improvements over ARM7 cores, enabled by spending more transistors, include:[3].Additionally, some ARM9 cores incorporate \"Enhanced DSP\" instructions, such as a multiply-accumulate, to support more efficient implementations of digital signal processing algorithms..Switching from a von Neumann architecture entailed using a non-unified cache, so that instruction fetches do not evict data (and vice versa).ARM9 cores have separate data and address bus signals, which chip designers use in various ways.In most cases they connect at least part of the address space in von Neumann style, used for both instructions and data, usually to an AHB interconnect connecting to a DRAM interface and an External Bus Interface usable with NOR flash memory.Such hybrids are no longer pure Harvard architecture processors..ARM Holdings neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the processor architecture to interested parties.ARM offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables.", "Commonwealth": "A commonwealth is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the common good.The noun \"commonwealth\", meaning \"public welfare, general good or advantage\", dates from the 15th century.[1] Originally a phrase (the common-wealth or the common wealth \u2013 echoed in the modern synonym \"public wealth\"), it comes from the old meaning of \"wealth\", which is \"well-being\", and is itself a loose translation of the Latin res publica.[2] The term literally meant \"common well-being\".In the 17th century, the definition of \"commonwealth\" expanded from its original sense of \"public welfare\" or \"commonweal\" to mean \"a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or democratic state\".[3][4].The term evolved to become a title to a number of political entities.Three countries \u2013 Australia, the Bahamas, and Dominica \u2013 have the official title \"Commonwealth\", as do four U.S.states and two U.S.territories.Since the early 20th century, the term has been used to name some fraternal associations of states, most notably the Commonwealth of Nations, an organisation primarily of former territories of the British Empire.The organisation is not to be confused with the realms of the Commonwealth..Translations of Ancient Roman writers' works to English have on occasion translated \"Res publica\", and variants thereof, to \"the commonwealth\", a term referring to the Roman state as a whole..The Commonwealth of England was the official name of the political unit (de facto military rule in the name of parliamentary supremacy) that replaced the Kingdom of England (after the English Civil War) from 1649\u201353 and 1659\u201360, under the rule of Oliver Cromwell and his son and successor Richard.From 1653 to 1659, although still legally known as a Commonwealth, the republic, united with the former Kingdom of Scotland, operated under different institutions (at times as a de facto monarchy) and is known by historians as the Protectorate.", "September 11 attacks": "The September 11 attacks, commonly known as 9/11,[d] were four coordinated Islamist suicide terrorist attacks carried out by al-Qaeda against the United States in 2001.That morning, 19 terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners scheduled to travel from the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions of the East Coast to California.The hijackers crashed the first two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, two of the world's five tallest buildings at the time, and aimed the next two flights toward targets in or near Washington, D.C., in an attack on the nation's capital.The third team succeeded in crashing into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S.Department of Defense in Arlington County, Virginia, while the fourth plane crashed in rural Pennsylvania following a passenger revolt.The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people and instigated the multi-decade global war on terror..The first impact was that of American Airlines Flight 11, which crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan at 8:46a.m.[e] Sixteen minutes later, at 9:03,[f] the World Trade Center's South Tower was hit by United Airlines Flight 175.Both 110-story skyscrapers collapsed within an hour and forty-one minutes,[g] bringing about the destruction of the remaining five structures in the WTC complex and damaging or destroying nearby buildings.A third flight, American Airlines Flight 77, crashed into the Pentagon at 9:37a.m., causing a partial collapse.The fourth and final flight, United Airlines Flight 93, flew in the direction of the capital.Alerted to the previous attacks, the passengers retaliated in an attempt to take control of the aircraft, forcing the hijackers to crash the plane in a Stonycreek Township field, near Indian Lake and Shanksville, at 10:03a.m.Investigators determined that Flight 93's target was either the United States Capitol or the White House..", "Crater Lake National Park": "Crater Lake National Park is an American national park located in southern Oregon.Established in 1902, Crater Lake is the fifth-oldest national park in the United States and the only national park in Oregon.[3] The park encompasses the caldera of Crater Lake, a remnant of Mount Mazama, a destroyed volcano, and the surrounding hills and forests..The lake is 1,949 feet (594m) deep at its deepest point,[4] which makes it the deepest lake in the United States, the second-deepest in North America and the ninth-deepest in the world.[4] Crater Lake is often referred to as the seventh-deepest lake in the world, but this former listing excludes the approximately 3,000-foot (910m) depth of subglacial Lake Vostok in Antarctica, which resides under nearly 13,000 feet (4,000m) of ice, and the recent report of a 2,740-foot (840m) maximum depth for Lake O'Higgins/San Martin, located on the border of Chile and Argentina.However, when comparing its average depth of 1,148 feet (350m) to the average depth of other deep lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third-deepest in the world.The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical 4,000-foot-deep (1,200m) caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the Cascade Range..The caldera rim ranges in elevation from 7,000 to 8,000 feet (2,100 to 2,400m).The United States Geological Survey benchmark elevation of the lake surface is 6,178 feet (1,883m).The national park encompasses 183,224 acres (286.3sqmi; 741.5km2).[1]  Crater Lake has no streams flowing into or out of it.All water that enters the lake is eventually lost from evaporation or subsurface seepage.The lake's water commonly has a striking blue hue, and the lake is refilled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain..As stated in the foundation document:[5].Crater Lake National Park forever preserves Crater Lake, scenic landscapes, volcanic features, and unique ecological and cultural heritage, and fosters understanding and appreciation through enjoyment, education, and inspiration..", "Supreme Court of the United States": "The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States.It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all federal court cases, and over state court cases that involve a point of U.S.Constitutional or federal law.It also has original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases, specifically \"all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party.\"[1] The court holds the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the Constitution.It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law.[2] However, it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction.The court may decide cases having political overtones, but has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions..Established by Article Three of the United States Constitution, the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789.The court consists of nine justices: the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, and the justices meet at the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C.Justices have lifetime tenure, meaning they remain on the court until they die, retire, resign, or are impeached and removed from office.[3] When a vacancy occurs, the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoints a new justice.Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before the court.When in the majority, the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court; otherwise, the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion..The Supreme Court receives on average about 7,000 petitions for writs of certiorari each year, but grants only 70\u201390.[4] In recent years[when?], the Supreme Court has seen substantial criticism over democratic backsliding, ethics scandals and a lack of external enforcement, partisan rulings, secretive decisions, and limited and slow ability to take on cases, among other controversies..", "Conroe, Texas": "Conroe is a city in and the county seat of MontgomeryCounty, Texas, United States, about 40 miles (64km) north of Houston.It is aprincipal city in the Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land metropolitan area.[6].As of 2023, the population was 103,035.[7] Since 2007, the city has increased in size (and population) by annexation, with the city territory expanding from 52.8 to 74.4 square miles.Some communities have attempted to fight such annexation.According to the Census Bureau, Conroe was the fastest-growing large city in the United States between July 1, 2015, and July 1, 2016.[3].The city is named after Isaac Conroe.Born in the North, he served as a Union Cavalry officer and settled in Houston after the Civil War.There he became a lumberman.[8] Conroe founded a sawmill in this area in 1881.[8] The community built its early economy and wealth on the lumber industry.Originally named \"Conroe's Switch\",[8] the community received an influx of workers and residents in the late 19th century who were attracted to the growth of the lumber industry, which harvested the local piney wood forest.[8].In 1886, Conroe Mill School was established in the expanding town.Conroe Normal and Industrial College, a school for African Americans, served the area..Six lynchings were recorded in Montgomery County around the turn of the century, and some suspects were lynched at the courthouse in Conroe.", "Book of Mormon": "The Book of Mormon is a religious text of the Latter Day Saint movement, which, according to Latter Day Saint theology, contains writings of ancient prophets who lived on the American continent from 600 BC to AD 421 and during an interlude dated by the text to the unspecified time of the Tower of Babel.[1][2] It was first published in March 1830 by Joseph Smith as The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.[3][4] The Book of Mormon is one of the earliest and most well known unique writings of the Latter Day Saint movement.The denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement typically regard the text primarily as scripture (sometimes as one of four standard works) and secondarily as a record of God's dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas.[5] The majority of Latter Day Saints believe the book to be a record of real-world history, with Latter Day Saint denominations viewing it variously as an inspired record of scripture to the lynchpin or \"keystone\" of their religion.[6] Some Latter Day Saint academics and apologetic organizations strive to affirm the book as historically authentic through their scholarship and research,[7] but mainstream archaeological, historical, and scientific communities have discovered little to support the existence of the civilizations described therein, and do not consider it to be an actual record of historical events.[8].According to Smith's account and the book's narrative, the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as \"reformed Egyptian\"[9] engraved on golden plates.Smith said that the last prophet to contribute to the book, a man named Moroni, buried it in the Hill Cumorah in present-day Manchester, New York, before his death, and then appeared in a vision to Smith in 1827 as an angel, revealing the location of the plates and instructing him to translate the plates into English.[2] Most naturalistic views on the origins of the Book of Mormon hold that Smith authored it, drawing, whether consciously or subconsciously, on material and ideas from his contemporary 19th-century environment, rather than translating an ancient record.[10][11].The Book of Mormon has a number of doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of Adam and Eve,[12] the nature of the Christian atonement,[13] eschatology, agency, priesthood authority, redemption from physical and spiritual death,[14] the nature and conduct of baptism, the age of accountability, the purpose and practice of communion, personalized revelation, economic justice, the anthropomorphic and personal nature of God, the nature of spirits and angels, and the organization of the latter day church.The pivotal event of the book is an appearance of Jesus Christ in the Americas shortly after his resurrection.[15] Common teachings of the Latter Day Saint movement hold that the Book of Mormon fulfills numerous biblical prophecies by ending a global apostasy and signaling a restoration of Christian gospel.The book is also a critique of Western society, condemning immorality, individualism, social inequality, ethnic injustice, nationalism, and the rejection of God, revelation, and miraculous religion.[16].The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books, titled after individuals named as primary authors or other caretakers of the ancient record the Book of Mormon describes itself as and, in most versions, is divided into chapters and verses.[17] Its English text imitates the style of the King James Version of the Bible,[17] and its grammar and word choice reflect Early Modern English.[18] The Book of Mormon has been fully or partially translated into at least 112 languages.[19].According to Joseph Smith, in 1823, when he was seventeen years old, an angel of God named Moroni appeared to him and said that a collection of ancient writings was buried in a nearby hill in present-day Wayne County, New York, engraved on golden plates by ancient prophets.[20][21] The writings were said to describe a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western hemisphere 600 years before Jesus's birth.[2] (This \"angel Moroni\" figure also appears in the Book of Mormon as the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days.) Smith said this vision occurred on the evening of September 21, 1823, and that on the following day, via divine guidance, he located the burial location of the plates on this hill and was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the same hill on September 22 of the following year to receive further instructions, which repeated annually for the next three years.[22][23] Smith told his entire immediate family about this angelic encounter by the next night, and his brother William reported that the family \"believed all he [Joseph Smith] said\" about the angel and plates.[24].Smith and his family reminisced that as part of what Smith believed was angelic instruction, Moroni provided Smith with a \"brief sketch\" of the \"origin, progress, civilization, laws, governments...righteousness and iniquity\" of the \"aboriginal inhabitants of the country\" (referring to the Nephites and Lamanites who figure in the Book of Mormon's primary narrative).Smith sometimes shared what he believed he had learned through such angelic encounters with his family in what his mother Lucy Mack Smith called \"most amusing recitals\".[25].", "Enlisted rank": "An enlisted rank (also known as an enlisted grade or enlisted rate) is, in some armed services, any rank below that of a commissioned officer.The term can be inclusive of non-commissioned officers or warrant officers, except in United States military usage where warrant officers/chief warrant officers are a separate officer category ranking above enlisted grades and below commissioned officer grades.In most cases, enlisted service personnel perform jobs specific to their own occupational specialty, as opposed to the more generalized command responsibilities of commissioned officers.[1] The term \"enlistment\" refers solely to a military commitment (whether officer or enlisted) whereas the terms \"taken on strength\" and \"struck off strength\" refer to a service member being carried on a given unit's roll.[2].In the Canadian Armed Forces, the term non-commissioned member (NCM) is used.[3].For the ranks used by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, non-commissioned ranks are coded OR1\u2013OR9 (bottom to top), OR being an abbreviation for Other Ranks.[4][5].The five branches of the U.S.Armed Forces all use the same \"E-\" designation for enlisted pay grades, with service-specific names applied to each (e.g., chief petty officer, master gunnery sergeant, private first class).[6] Each branch incorporates it as part of a service member's job specialty designator.In the United States Air Force, this job specialty designator is known as an Air Force Specialty Code, in the United States Army and United States Marine Corps, a Military Occupational Specialty, and in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard, a rating..Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate.HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload file.Create accountLog in.Create account Log in.", "What a Wonderful World": "\"What a Wonderful World\" is a song written by Bob Thiele (as \"George Douglas\") and George David Weiss.It was first recorded by Louis Armstrong and released in 1967 as a single.In April 1968, it topped the pop chart in the United Kingdom,[2] but performed poorly in the United States because Larry Newton, the president of ABC Records, disliked the song and refused to promote it..After it was heard in the film Good Morning, Vietnam, it was reissued as a single in 1988, and rose to number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100.[3] Armstrong's recording was inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999..Thiele produced the track under his own name, but as a co-composer was initially credited under the pseudonym George Douglas.His real name has appeared on it from its 1988 issue onward..One source claims the song was first offered to Tony Bennett, who turned it down,[4] although Louis Armstrong biographer Ricky Riccardi disputes this.[5][non-primary source needed] In Graham Nash's book Off the Record: Songwriters on Songwriting, George Weiss says he wrote the song specifically for Louis Armstrong, as he was inspired by Armstrong's ability to bring together people of different races..Armstrong was gigging at the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas, so he chose to record the song nearby at Bill Porter\u2019s United Recording studio.The session was scheduled to follow Armstrong's midnight show, and by 2am the musicians were settled and tape was rolling.Arranger Artie Butler was there with songwriters Weiss and Thiele, and Armstrong was in the studio singing with the orchestra.Armstrong had recently signed to ABC Records, and ABC president Larry Newton showed up to photograph Armstrong.Newton wanted a swingy pop song like \"Hello, Dolly!\", a big hit for Armstrong when he was with Kapp Records, so when Newton heard the slow pace of \"What a Wonderful World\", he tried to stop the session.", "Sound film": "A sound film is a motion picture with synchronized sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, as opposed to a silent film.The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures became commercially practical.Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate.Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.The sound film was also played with organs or pianos in the actual movie to represent sound..The primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the mid-to-late 1920s.At first, the sound films which included synchronized dialogue, known as \"talking pictures\", or \"talkies\", were exclusively shorts.The earliest feature-length movies with recorded sound included only music and effects.The first feature film originally presented as a talkie (although it had only limited sound sequences) was The Jazz Singer, which premiered on October 6, 1927.[2] A major hit, it was made with Vitaphone, which was at the time the leading brand of sound-on-disc technology.Sound-on-film, however, would soon become the standard for talking pictures..By the early 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon.In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's position as one of the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States).", "African people": "The population of Africa has grown rapidly over the past century[1] and consequently shows a large youth bulge, further reinforced by a low life expectancy of below 50 years in some African countries.[2] Total population as of 2020 is estimated to be more than 1.3 billion,[3] with a growth rate of more than 2.5% p.a.The total fertility rate (births per woman) for Africa is 4.7 as of 2018, the highest in the world according to the World Bank.[4] The most populous African country is Nigeria with over 206 million inhabitants as of 2020 and a growth rate of 2.6% p.a.[5].Source: Maddison and others.(University of Groningen).[6].Source: Maddison and others (University of Groningen) and others.[6].Registration of vital events in most of Africa is incomplete.The website Our World in Data prepared the following estimates based on statistics from the Population Department of the United Nations.[11].The Sahara Desert, covering most of North Africa, and the smaller Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa, are very sparsely populated.Heavily populated areas include the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Nile River valley and delta, Nigeria and vicinity and the southern coast of West Africa, Ethiopia, the greater East African Rift area, Madagascar, coastal and urban South Africa, and the Middle Africa megacities of Kinshasa and Luanda..The population of Africa was 177 million in 1950, and it grew 7.6 times to more than 1.341 billion in 2020.[3].The increase in population is explosive, with a population under the age of 14 in the exponential growth phase, a difference from almost the rest of the world, which is already in balance (United States 1966, Europe 1969, Mexico 1990, Latin America 2000, India 2009, Asia 1977).[citation needed].As of 2019, the total population of Africa is estimated at 1.3 billion, representing 16 percent of the world's population.[12] According to UN estimates, the population of Africa may reach 2.49 billion by 2050 (about 26% of the world's total) and 4.28 billion by 2100 (about 39% of the world's total).[12] The number of babies born in Africa compared to the rest of the world is expected to reach approximately 37% in the year 2050.[13].", "ARIA Music Awards": "The Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards (commonly known informally as ARIA Music Awards, ARIA Awards, or simply the ARIAs) is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the Australian music industry, put on by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).The event has been held annually since 1987 and encompasses the general genre-specific and popular awards (these are what is usually being referred to as \"the ARIA awards\") as well as Fine Arts Awards and Artisan Awards (held separately from 2004), Achievement Awards and ARIA Hall of Fame \u2013 the latter were held separately from 2005 to 2010 but returned to the general ceremony in 2011.For 2010, ARIA introduced public voted awards for the first time..Winning, or even being nominated for, an ARIA award results in a lot of media attention and publicity on an artist, and usually increases recording sales several-fold, as well as chart significance \u2013 in 2005, for example, after Ben Lee won three awards, his album Awake Is the New Sleep jumped from No.31 to No.5 in the ARIA Charts, its highest position.In October 1995 singer-songwriter Tina Arena became the first woman to win Album of the Year for Don't Ask (1994) and Song of the Year for \"Chains\".Before the ceremony the album had achieved 3\u00d7 platinum (for shipment of 210,000 copies) and by year's end it was 8\u00d7 platinum (560,000 copies) and had topped the end of year albums chart.[2][third-party source needed].In 1983, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) was established by the six major record companies then operating in Australia, EMI, Festival Records, CBS (now known as Sony Music), RCA (now known as BMG), WEA (now known as Warner Music) and PolyGram (now known as Universal) replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956.[3] It later included smaller record companies representing independent acts/labels and has over 100 members.[3].Australian TV pop music show Countdown presented its own annual awards ceremony, Countdown Music and Video Awards, which were co-produced by Carolyn James (also known as Carolyn Bailey) from 1981 to 1984 and, in the latter two years, in collaboration with ARIA.[4][5][6] ARIA provided peer voting for some awards, while Countdown provided coupons in the related Countdown Magazine for viewers to vote for populist awards.[7] At the 1985 Countdown awards ceremony, held on 14 April 1986, fans of INXS and Uncanny X-Men scuffled during the broadcast and as a result ARIA decided to hold their own awards.[6] Australian music journalist, Anthony O'Grady, described the fans of Uncanny X-Men, \"screeching dismay and derision every time their heroes were denied a prize.Finally, when INXS were announced Best Group and Michael Hutchence walked towards the stage, X-Men fans unfurled a 2-metre banner reading: '@*l! OFF POCK FACE'.\"[8].After that ceremony ARIA withdrew their support for the Countdown awards.Meanwhile, four music industry representatives had met in Sydney: a talent manager Peter Rix and three record company executives Brian Harris, Peter Ikin and Gil Robert.Rix summarised the outcome, \"the industry deserved a peer-voting Awards night and it needed to be sanctioned by\" ARIA.[8] Its \"primary purpose was to strive for some sort of objective overview of excellence in recording.\"[8] Rather than the ARIA board pay the entire cost of the event, \"we cooked up a scheme whereby the ARIA Awards would be funded by individual record companies buying tickets for a dinner.\"[8] Rix and his group approached ARIA board members, Paul Turner (also managing director of WEA) and Brian Smith (BMG's managing director) then-chairperson of ARIA.", "For-profit education": "For-profit education (also known as the education services industry or proprietary education) refers to educational institutions operated by private, profit-seeking businesses.For-profit education is common in many parts of the world, making up more than 70% of the higher education sector in Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines.[1].In 2011, Australia had over 170 for-profit higher education institutions, taking in 6% of the total student population.Their qualifications are legally equivalent to those issued by the public universities, but there have been concerns raised by external audits about the quality assurance and standards in for-profit colleges.[1].There are also concerns over the low representation of Indigenous students, students from low socio-economic status backgrounds and students from non-English speaking backgrounds in for-profit colleges, which falls behind that in public universities.However, for-profit colleges do give a second chance to many students who would not otherwise have access to higher education.Partnerships between for-profit \"pathway\" colleges and public universities have also proven effective in recruiting overseas students.In this model, students spend a year at the pathway college before transferring to the university for two years to complete their degree; 70% of students at the pathway colleges are foreign, going on to make up 45% of foreign students recruited by the partner universities.[1].In 2021, China banned for-profit tutoring companies.[2].The UK does not permit for-profit schools (independent schools are mostly non-profit making trusts), but there are a number of for-profit institutions in higher education.In 2013, Michael Gove, then secretary of state for education, was said to have drawn up plans to allow free schools and academies to become for-profit businesses, and in 2014, his successor Nicky Morgan refused to rule out for-profit schools.", "Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution": "The Twenty-second Amendment (Amendment XXII) to the United States Constitution limits the number of times a person can be elected to the office of President of the United States to two terms, and sets additional eligibility conditions for presidents who succeed to the unexpired terms of their predecessors.[1] Congress approved the Twenty-second Amendment on March 21, 1947, and submitted it to the state legislatures for ratification.That process was completed on February 27, 1951, when the requisite 36 of the 48 states had ratified the amendment (neither Alaska nor Hawaii had yet been admitted as states), and its provisions came into force on that date..The amendment prohibits anyone who has been elected president twice from being elected again.Under the amendment, someone who fills an unexpired presidential term lasting more than two years is also prohibited from being elected president more than once.Scholars debate whether the amendment prohibits affected individuals from succeeding to the presidency under any circumstances or whether it applies only to presidential elections.Until the amendment's ratification, the president had not been subject to term limits, but both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson (the first and third presidents) decided not to serve a third term, establishing the two-term tradition.In the 1940 and 1944 presidential elections, Franklin D.Roosevelt became the only president to win third and fourth terms, giving rise to concerns about a president serving unlimited terms.[2].Section 1.No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term..Section 2.", "List of Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo episodes": "Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo was an anime television series based on the manga series of the same name.The series was directed by Hiroki Shibata[1] and produced by Toei Animation.It ran for 76 episodes, from November 8, 2003 to October 29, 2005 on TV Asahi..Joy Tashjian Marketing Group, a licensing representative named by Toei Animation, licensed the anime in North America.[2] Preview clips of the series were aired during Cartoon Network's \"Summer 2005 Kick-Off Special\" in May 2005,[3] and the series premiered on September 30.The series also aired on Cartoon Network's Toonami programming block on Saturdays at 9-10 p.m., starting on October 1.[4] Additionally, it was available on Cartoon Network's broadband service, Toonami Jetstream, from November 5, 2007 until the

originally licensed for home video release in North America by Illumitoon Entertainment in 2006,[8] who released only two volumes on bilingual DVD in 2007.[9][10] All further volumes were canceled when their distribution deal with Westlake Entertainment fell through.[11] S'more Entertainment announced on January 16, 2012 that they would release the series with English subtitles and dubbing on DVD on April 10 of the same year.[12][13] This release, however, lacked an English subtitle track, despite a fully translated script being present on a PDF file on disc 4 and indications on the box and in the pre-release information that there would be a subtitle track.[14] S'more Entertainment released a statement claiming the packaging was wrong, and that there was never an intention to subtitle the release due to costs.[15] In August 2018, Discotek Media announced their licensing of the series and released an SD Blu-ray disc set of all 76 episodes on January 28, 2020.[16][17].Main

park between the Upper West Side and Upper East Side neighborhoods of Manhattan in New York City that was the first landscaped park in the United States.It is the fifth-largest park in the city, containing 843 acres (341ha), and the most visited urban park in the United States, with an estimated 42million visitors annually as of 2016[update]..The creation of a large park in Manhattan was first proposed in the 1840s, and a 778-acre (315ha) park approved in 1853.In 1857, landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux won a design competition for the park with their \"Greensward Plan\".Construction began the same year; existing structures, including a majority-Black settlement named Seneca Village, were seized through eminent domain and razed.The park's first areas were opened to the public in late 1858.Additional land at the northern end of Central Park was purchased in 1859, and the park was completed in 1876.After a period of decline in the early 20thcentury, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses started a program to clean up Central Park in the 1930s.The Central Park Conservancy, created in 1980 to combat further deterioration in the late 20thcentury, refurbished many parts of the park starting in the 1980s..Main attractions include landscapes such as the Ramble and Lake, Hallett Nature Sanctuary, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, and Sheep Meadow; amusement attractions such as Wollman Rink, Central Park Carousel, and the Central Park Zoo; formal spaces such as the Central Park Mall and Bethesda Terrace; and the

water features to alter drainage, navigability, and commercial use; constructing dams, dikes, and other controls for streams and shorelines; and recovering valuable mineral deposits or marine life having commercial value.In all but a few situations the excavation is undertaken by a specialist floating plant, known as a dredger..Usually the main objectives of dredging is to recover material of value or use, or to create a greater depth of water.[1] Dredging systems can either be shore-based, brought to a location based on barges, or built into purpose built vessels..Dredging has significant environmental impacts: it can disturb marine sediments, leading to both short- and long-term water pollution, destroy important seabed ecosystems, and can release legacy human-sourced toxins captured in the sediment.These environmental impacts can significantly hurt marine wildlife populations, contaminate sources of drinking water and interrupt economic activities such as fishing..Dredging is excavation carried out underwater or partially underwater, in shallow waters or ocean waters.It keeps waterways and ports navigable, and assists coastal protection, land reclamation and coastal redevelopment, by gathering up bottom sediments and transporting it elsewhere.Dredging can be done to recover materials of commercial value; these may be high value minerals or sediments such as sand and gravel that are used by the construction industry.[2].Dredging is a four-part process: loosening the material, bringing the material to the surface (together extraction), transportation and disposal.[1].The extract can be disposed of locally or transported by barge or in a liquid suspension in pipelines.Disposal can be to infill sites, or the material can be used constructively to replenish eroded sand that has been lost to coastal erosion, or constructively create sea-walls, building land[1] or whole new landforms such as viable islands in coral atolls.[3].", "Volcano": "A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface..On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater.For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates.Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande rift in North America.Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs from the core\u2013mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers (1,900mi) deep in the Earth.This results in hotspot volcanism, of which the Hawaiian hotspot is an example.Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another..Large eruptions can affect atmospheric temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the Sun and cool the Earth's troposphere.Historically, large volcanic eruptions have been followed by volcanic winters which have caused catastrophic famines.[1].Other planets besides Earth have volcanoes.For example, volcanoes are very numerous on Venus.[2].The word volcano is derived from the name of Vulcano, a volcanic island in the Aeolian Islands of Italy whose name in turn comes from Vulcan, the god of fire in Roman mythology.[3] The study of volcanoes is called volcanology, sometimes spelled vulcanology.[4].", "Benedict arnold": "This monument was erected under the patronage of the State of Connecticut in the 55th year of the

1780.General George Washington had given him his fullest trust and had placed him in command of West Point in New York.Arnold was planning to surrender the fort to British forces, but the plot was discovered in September 1780, whereupon he fled to the British lines.In the later part of the war, Arnold was commissioned as a brigadier general in the British Army and placed in command of the American Legion.He led the British army in battle against the soldiers whom he had once commanded, after which his name became synonymous with treason and betrayal in the United States.[2].Arnold was

worldwide pop culture phenomenon.The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.[b] Star Wars is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time..The original 1977 film, retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope, was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy.Lucas later returned to the series to write and direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005).In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise.This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)..All nine films, collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\", were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to the first two releases.Together with the theatrical live action \"anthology\" films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10billion, making Star Wars the third-highest-grossing film franchise of all time..The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\"[3] across multiple fictional eras, in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to in the films as 'droids'), which may be programmed for personal assistance or battle.[4] Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology.[5][6][7] The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes.Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a Star Wars planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life.[8] The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae.[9][10] Spacecraft range from small starfighters to large capital ships, such as the Star Destroyers, as well as space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars.[11][12][13] Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections and hyperspace transmission.[14].The universe of Star Wars is generally similar to the real universe but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative stories.[15] One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as \"an energy field created by all living things ...[that] binds the galaxy together\".[16] The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god.[17] Through training and meditation, those whom \"the Force is strong with\" exhibit various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).[18] It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force.[19] The mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression.[20][21] While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.[22].", "Plateletpheresis": "Plateletpheresis (more accurately called thrombocytapheresis or thrombapheresis, though these names are rarely used) is the process of collecting thrombocytes, more commonly called platelets, a component of blood involved in blood clotting.The term specifically refers to the method of collecting the platelets, which is performed by a device used in blood donation that separates the platelets and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.Platelet transfusion can be a life-saving procedure in preventing or treating serious complications from bleeding and hemorrhage in patients who have disorders manifesting as thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) or platelet dysfunction.This process may also be used therapeutically to treat disorders resulting in extraordinarily high platelet counts such as essential thrombocytosis..Platelet transfusions are traditionally given to patients undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia, multiple myeloma, those with aplastic anemia, AIDS, hypersplenism, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), sepsis, bone marrow transplant, radiation treatment, organ transplant or surgeries such as cardiopulmonary bypass.Platelet transfusions should be avoided in those with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) because it can worsen neurologic symptoms and acute renal failure, presumably due to creation of new thrombi as the platelets are consumed.It should also be avoided in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).[citation needed].In adults, platelets are recommended in those who have levels less than 10,000/\u00b5L, or less than 20,000/\u00b5L if a central venous catheter is being placed, or less than 50,000/\u00b5L if a lumbar puncture or major surgery is required.[1].Not all platelet transfusions use platelets collected by automated apheresis.The platelets can also be separated from donations of whole blood collected in a traditional blood donation, but there are several advantages to separating the platelets at the time of collection.The first advantage is that the whole-blood platelets, sometimes called \"random\" platelets, from a single donation are not numerous enough for a dose to give to an adult patient.They must be pooled from several donors to create a single transfusion, and this complicates processing and increases the risk of diseases that can be spread in transfused blood, such as human immunodeficiency virus.[citation needed].", "Port (computer networking)": "In computer networking, a port or port number is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service.At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service.A port at the software level is identified for each transport protocol and address combination by the port number assigned to it.The most common transport protocols that use port numbers are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP); those port numbers are 16-bit unsigned numbers..A port number is always associated with a network address of a host, such as an IP address, and the type of transport protocol used for communication.It completes the destination or origination address of a message.Specific port numbers are reserved to identify specific services so that an arriving packet can be easily forwarded to a running application.For this purpose, port numbers lower than 1024 identify the historically most commonly used services and are called the well-known port numbers.Higher-numbered ports are available for general use by applications and are known as ephemeral ports..Ports provide a multiplexing service for multiple services or multiple communication sessions at one network address.In the client\u2013server model of application architecture, multiple simultaneous communication sessions may be initiated for the same service..For TCP and UDP, a port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535.", "Area code 479": "Area code 479 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for thirteen counties in the northwestern part of the U.S.state of Arkansas.The numbering plan area (NPA) includes the cities of Bentonville, Fort Smith, Fayetteville, Rogers, Siloam Springs and Springdale.It was created on January 19, 2002 in an area code split of area code 501..Area code 479 serves the

"Arraignment is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant, to inform them of the charges against them.In response to arraignment, in some jurisdictions, the accused is expected to enter a plea; in other jurisdictions, no plea is required.Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions, but they generally include guilty, not guilty, and the peremptory pleas, or pleas in bar, setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed.Pleas of nolo contendere ('no contest') and the Alford plea are allowed in some circumstances..In Australia, arraignment is the first of 11 stages in a criminal trial, and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment.The judge will testify during the indictment process.[citation needed].In British Columbia, arraignment takes place in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer.The defendant is asked whether they plead guilty or not guilty to each charge.[1].In France, the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than 24 hours from the time of the arrest.[2] However, police custody can last another 24 hours in specific circumstances, especially if the offence is punishable by at least one year's imprisonment, or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time, and can last up to 96 hours in certain cases involving terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime.[2] The police need to have the consent of the prosecutor, the procureur.In the vast majority of cases, the prosecutor will consent.[2].In Germany, if one has been arrested and taken into custody by the police, one must be brought before a judge as soon as possible and at the latest on the day after the arrest.[3].In New Zealand law, at the first appearance of the accused, they are read the charges and asked for a plea.", "Geoffrey Chaucer": "Geoffrey Chaucer (/\u02c8t\u0283\u0254\u02d0s\u0259r/; c.\u20091340s \u2013 25 October 1400) was an English poet, author, and civil servant best known for The Canterbury Tales.[1] He has been called the \"father of English literature\", or, alternatively, the \"father of English poetry\".[2]  He was the first writer to be buried in what has since come to be called Poets' Corner, in Westminster Abbey.[3] Chaucer also gained fame as a philosopher and astronomer, composing the scientific A Treatise on the Astrolabe for his 10-year-old son Lewis.He maintained a career in the civil service as a bureaucrat, courtier, diplomat, and member of parliament..Among Chaucer's many other works are The Book of the Duchess, The House of Fame, The Legend of Good Women, and Troilus and Criseyde.He is seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of Middle English when the dominant literary languages in England were still Anglo-Norman French and Latin.[4] Chaucer's contemporary Thomas Hoccleve hailed him as \"the firste fyndere of our fair langage\" (i.e., the first one capable of finding poetic matter in English).[5][6] Almost two thousand English words are first attested to in Chaucerian manuscripts..Chaucer was born in London most likely in the early 1340s (by some accounts, including his monument, he was born in 1343), though the precise date and location remain unknown.The Chaucer family offers an extraordinary example of upward mobility.His great-grandfather was a tavern keeper, his grandfather worked as a purveyor of wines, and his father John Chaucer rose to become an important wine merchant with a royal appointment.[7] Several previous generations of Geoffrey Chaucer's family had been vintners[8][9] and merchants in Ipswich.[10] His family name is derived from the French chaucier, once thought to mean 'shoemaker', but now known to mean a maker of hose or leggings.[11].In 1324, his father John Chaucer was kidnapped by an aunt in the hope of marrying the 12-year-old to her daughter in an attempt to keep the property in Ipswich.The aunt was imprisoned and fined \u00a3250, now equivalent to about \u00a3200,000, which suggests that the family was financially secure.[12].John Chaucer married Agnes Copton, who inherited properties in 1349, including 24 shops in London from her uncle Hamo de Copton, who is described in a will dated 3April 1354 and listed in the City Hustings Roll as \"moneyer\", said to be a moneyer at the Tower of London.In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, dated June 1380, Chaucer refers to himself as me Galfridum Chaucer, filium Johannis Chaucer, Vinetarii, Londonie, which translates as: \"I, Geoffrey Chaucer, son of the vintner John Chaucer, London\".[13].While records concerning the lives of his contemporaries William Langland and the Gawain Poet are practically non-existent, since Chaucer was a public servant his official life is very well documented, with nearly five hundred written items testifying to his career.", "Chicago Blizzard of 1979": "The Chicago blizzard of 1979 was a major blizzard that affected northern Illinois and northwest Indiana on January 13\u201314, 1979.It was one of the largest Chicago snowstorms in history at the time, with 21 inches (53cm) of snowfall in the two-day period.[1] Only 2 inches (5.1cm) to 4 inches (10cm) of snow was expected[2] but by the end of Sunday, January 14, the depth of snow on the ground peaked at 29 inches (74cm).[3] The blizzard lasted for a total of 38 hours.At its peak, wind gusts reached speeds of  39 miles (63km) per hour.[4]  Five people died during the blizzard, with approximately 15 others seriously injured due to conditions created by the storm.One of the five deaths came when a snowplow driver went berserk, hitting 34 cars and ramming a man.[3].O'Hare Airport was closed and all flights were grounded for 96 hours, from January 13 to 15.[3] The cold weather and snowfall throughout the rest of January and February resulted in frozen tracks throughout the Chicago 'L' system.[3] Consequently, commuters overwhelmed the capacity of CTA buses, causing bus commutes that normally would have taken 30 to 45 minutes to take up to several hours.To avoid huge snowdrifts in the streets, the overcrowded buses were obliged to take numerous detours, adding additional time to the commute.[citation needed].Snow remained on the ground until March 6, a full fifty-one days.[4] Deployment of plows was significantly delayed, and when they finally appeared they struggled to keep up with the snowfall.Much of the snow remained unmoved throughout the next two months, causing ongoing public transit delays and significant problems with trash collection.The city's inadequate response to the blizzard was blamed primarily on mayor Michael Bilandic, who had assumed the post after the 1976 death of Richard J.Daley.[5][6] Newspaper articles at the time blasted Bilandic.Jane Byrne, Bilandic's main opposition in the Democratic primary, capitalized on this and defeated Bilandic in the February 27 primary, eventually becoming the first female mayor of Chicago.[5][6].Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate.", "12-hour clock": "The 12-hour clock is a time convention in which the 24 hours of the day are divided into two periods: a.m.(from Latin ante meridiem, translating to \"before midday\") and p.m.(from Latin post meridiem, translating to \"after midday\").[1][2] Each period consists of 12 hours numbered: 12 (acting as 0),[3] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.The 12-hour clock was developed from the second millennium BC and reached its modern form in the 16th century..The 12-hour time convention is common in several English-speaking nations and former British colonies, as well as a few other countries.There is no widely accepted convention for how midday and midnight should be represented: in English-speaking countries, \"12p.m.\" indicates 12 o'clock noon, while \"12a.m.\" means 12 o'clock midnight.[4][5][6].The natural day-and-night division of a calendar day forms the fundamental basis as to why each day is split into two cycles.Originally there were two cycles: one cycle which could be tracked by the position of the Sun (day), followed by one cycle which could be tracked by the Moon and stars (night).This eventually evolved into the two 12-hour periods which are used today, one called \"a.m.\" starting at midnight and another called \"p.m.\" starting at noon.Noon itself is rarely abbreviated today; but if it is, it is denoted \"m.\"[1].The 12-hour clock can be traced back as far as Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt.[7] Both an Egyptian sundial for daytime use[8] and an Egyptian water clock for night-time use were found in the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep I.[9] Dating to c.\u20091500 BC, these clocks divided their respective times of use into 12 hours each..The Romans also used a 12-hour clock: daylight was divided into 12 equal hours (thus hours having varying length throughout the year) and the night was divided into four watches.[citation needed].", "Comparison of the health care systems in Canada and the United States": "A comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States is often made by government, public health and public policy analysts.[3][4][5][6][7] The two countries had similar healthcare systems before Canada changed its system in the 1960s and 1970s.The United States spends much more money on healthcare than Canada, on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP.[8] In 2006, per-capita spending for health care in Canada was US$3,678; in the U.S., US$6,714.The U.S.spent 15.3% of GDP on healthcare in that year; Canada spent 10.0%.[8] In 2006, 70% of healthcare spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46% in the United States.Total government spending per capita in the U.S.on healthcare was 23% higher than Canadian government spending.U.S.government expenditure on healthcare was just under 83% of total Canadian spending (public and private).[9].Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending.A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that \"health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent.\"[10] Some of the noted differences were a higher life expectancy in Canada, as well as a lower infant mortality rate than the United States..One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health Organization's ratings of \"overall health service performance\", which used a \"composite measure of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution\", ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations.This study rated the US \"responsiveness\", or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment, as 1st, compared with 7th for Canada.", "Tarantula": "Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy spiders of the family Theraphosidae.[2] As of August2022[update], 1,040 species have been identified, with 156 genera.[3] The term \"tarantula\" is usually used to describe members of the family Theraphosidae, although many other members of the same infraorder (Mygalomorphae) are commonly referred to as \"tarantulas\" or \"false tarantulas\".Some of the more common species have become popular in the exotic pet trade.Many New World species kept as pets have setae known as urticating hairs that can cause irritation to the skin, and in extreme cases, cause damage to the eyes.[4].Like all arthropods, the tarantula is an invertebrate that relies on an exoskeleton for muscular support.[5] Like other Arachnida, a tarantula's body comprises two main parts, the prosoma (or cephalothorax) and the opisthosoma (or abdomen).The prosoma and opisthosoma are connected by the pedicel, or pregenital somite.This waist-like connecting piece is actually part of the prosoma and gives the opisthosoma a wide range of motion relative to the prosoma..Depending on the species, the body length of tarantulas ranges from about 5 to 11cm (2 to 4+1\u20442in)[6] with leg spans of 8\u201330cm (3\u201312in).[citation needed] Leg span is determined by measuring from the tip of the back leg to the tip of the front leg on the opposite side.Some of the largest species of tarantula may weigh over 85g (3oz); the largest of all, the goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) from Venezuela and Brazil, has been reported to attain a weight of 170g (6oz)[7] and a leg-span up to 30cm (12in), males being longer and females greater in girth.The fang size of this tarantula reaches a maximum of 4cm (1+1\u20442in).[7].Theraphosa apophysis (the pinkfoot goliath) was described 187 years after the goliath birdeater, so its characteristics are not as well attested.T.blondi is generally thought to be the heaviest tarantula, and T.", "Ton": "Ton is any of several units of measure of mass, volume or force.It has a long history and has acquired several meanings and uses..As a unit of mass, ton can mean:.Its original use as a unit of volume has continued in the capacity of cargo ships and in units such as the freight ton and a number of other units, ranging from 35 to 100 cubic feet (0.99 to 2.83m3) in size.Recent specialized uses include the ton as a means of truck classification.It can also be used as a unit of energy, or in refrigeration as a unit of power, sometimes called a ton of refrigeration..Because the ton (of any system of measuring weight) is usually the heaviest unit named in colloquial speech, its name also has figurative uses, singular and plural, informally meaning a large amount or quantity, or to a great degree, as in \"There's a ton of bees in this hive\", \"We have tons of homework\", and \"I love you a ton.\".The ton is derived from the tun, the term applied to a cask of the largest capacity.This could contain a volume between 175 and 213 imperial gallons (210 and 256USgal; 800 and 970L), which could weigh around 2,000 pounds (910kg) and occupy some 60 cubic feet (1.7m3) of space.[1].There are several similar units of mass or volume called the ton:.The difference between the short ton and the other common forms (\"long\" and \"metric\") is about 10%, while the metric and long tons differ by less than 2%..The metric tonne is usually distinguished by its spelling when written, but in the United States and United Kingdom, it is pronounced the same as ton, hence is often spoken as \"metric ton\" when it is necessary to make the distinction.", "Stanley Cup": "The Stanley Cup (French: La Coupe Stanley) is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff champion.It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise in North America, and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) considers it to be one of the \"most important championships available to the sport\".[1] The trophy was commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup and is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the Governor General of Canada, who donated it as an award to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club.The entire Stanley family supported the sport, the sons and daughters all playing and promoting the game.[2] The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal Hockey Club, and winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play.Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906.In 1915, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the two main professional ice hockey organizations, reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup.It was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947..There are actually three Stanley Cups: the original bowl of the \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\", the authenticated \"Presentation Cup\", and the spelling-corrected \"Permanent Cup\" on display at the Hockey Hall of Fame whenever the Presentation Cup is not available.While the NHL has maintained control over the trophy itself and its associated trademarks, the NHL does not actually own the trophy but uses it by agreement with the two Canadian trustees of the cup.[3] The NHL has registered trademarks associated with the name and likeness of the Stanley Cup, although there has been dispute as to whether the league has the right to own trademarks associated with a trophy that it does not own.[4].The original bowl was made of silver and is 18.5 centimetres (7.28 inches) high and 29 centimetres (11.42 inches) wide.The current Stanley Cup is topped with a copy of the original bowl, made of a silver and nickel alloy.It has a height of 89.54centimetres (35.25inches) and weighs 15.5kilograms (34.5 lb).[5] Like the Grey Cup, and unlike the trophies awarded by the other major professional sports leagues of North America, a new Stanley Cup is not made every year.The winners originally kept it until a new champion was crowned, but winning teams currently get the Stanley Cup during the summer and a limited number of days during the season.", "Pineapple": "The pineapple[2][3] (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit; it is the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.[4].The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries.The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury.Since the 1820s, pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations..Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a multiple fruit.The plant normally propagates from the offset produced at the top of the fruit[2][5] or from a side shoot, and typically matures within a year.[5][6].The pineapple is a herbaceous perennial, which grows to 1.0 to 1.5m (3ft 3in to 4ft 11in) tall on average, although sometimes it can be taller.The plant has a short, stocky stem with tough, waxy leaves.When creating its fruit, it usually produces up to 200 flowers, although some large-fruited cultivars can exceed this.Once it flowers, the individual fruits of the flowers join together to create a multiple fruit.After the first fruit is produced, side shoots (called 'suckers' by commercial growers) are produced in the leaf axils of the main stem.These suckers may be removed for propagation, or left to produce additional fruits on the original plant.[5] Commercially, suckers that appear around the base are cultivated.", "Integer (computer science)": "In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values.Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits).The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers.Computer hardware nearly always provides a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer..The value of an item with an integral type is the mathematical integer that it corresponds to.Integral types may be unsigned (capable of representing only non-negative integers) or signed (capable of representing negative integers as well).[1].An integer value is typically specified in the source code of a program as a sequence of digits optionally prefixed with + or \u2212.Some programming languages allow other notations, such as hexadecimal (base 16) or octal (base 8).Some programming languages also permit digit group separators.[2].The internal representation of this datum is the way the value is stored in the computer's memory.Unlike mathematical integers, a typical datum in a computer has some minimal and maximum possible value..", "Hydroelectricity": "2019 world electricity generation by source (total generation was 27 petawatt-hours)[1][2].Hydroelectricity, or hydroelectric power, is electricity generated from hydropower (water power).Hydropower supplies one sixth of the world's electricity, almost 4500 TWh in 2020, which is more than all other renewable sources combined and also more than nuclear power.[3] Hydropower can provide large amounts of low-carbon electricity on demand, making it a key element for creating secure and clean electricity supply systems.[3] A hydroelectric power station that has a dam and reservoir is a flexible source, since the amount of electricity produced can be increased or decreased in seconds or minutes in response to varying electricity demand.Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, it produces no direct waste, and almost always emits considerably less greenhouse gas than fossil fuel-powered energy plants.[4] However, when constructed in lowland rainforest areas, where part of the forest is inundated, substantial amounts of greenhouse gases may be emitted.[5].Construction of a hydroelectric complex can have significant environmental impact, principally in loss of arable land and population displacement.[6][7] They also disrupt the natural ecology of the river involved, affecting habitats and ecosystems, and siltation and erosion patterns.While dams can ameliorate the risks of flooding, dam failure can be catastrophic..In 2021, global installed hydropower electrical capacity reached almost 1400 GW, the highest among all renewable energy technologies.[8] Hydroelectricity plays a leading role in countries like Brazil, Norway and China.[9] but there are geographical limits and environmental issues.[10] Tidal power can be used in coastal regions..Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks.In the late 18th century hydraulic power provided the energy source needed for the start of the Industrial Revolution.In the mid-1770s, French engineer Bernard Forest de B\u00e9lidor published Architecture Hydraulique, which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines, and in 1771 Richard Arkwright's combination of water power, the water frame, and continuous production played a significant part in the development of the factory system, with modern employment practices.[12] In the 1840s the hydraulic power network was developed to generate and transmit hydro power to end users..By the late 19th century, the electrical generator was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics.[13] The growing demand arising from the Industrial Revolution would drive development as well.[14] In 1878, the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at Cragside in Northumberland, England, by William Armstrong.It was used to power a single arc lamp in his art gallery.[15]  The old Schoelkopf Power Station No.", "History of wine": "The oldest fossil  proto-wines without grapes were found in China, in 7000 BC,[1] and evidence of ancient wine production has been found in Georgia from c.\u20096000 BC (the earliest known traces of grape wine),[1][2].Iran from c.\u20095000 BC,[3] Greece from c.\u20094500 BC,[4][5] Armenia from c.\u20094100 BC (large-scale production),[6][7][8][9][10][11] and Sicily from c.\u20094000 BC.[12].The earliest evidence of a grape and rice mixed based fermented drink sometimes compared to wine was found in ancient China (c.\u20097000 BC).[13][14][15][16][17].The altered consciousness produced by wine has been considered religious since its origin.The ancient Greeks worshiped Dionysus or Bacchus and the Ancient Romans carried on his cult.[18][19] Consumption of ritual wine, probably a certain type of sweet wine originally, was part of Jewish practice since Biblical times and, as part of the eucharist commemorating Jesus's Last Supper, became even more essential to the Christian Church.[20] Although Islam nominally forbade the production or consumption of wine, during its Golden Age, alchemists such as Geber pioneered wine's distillation for medicinal and industrial purposes such as the production of perfume.[21].Wine production and consumption increased, burgeoning from the 15th century onwards as part of European expansion.Despite the devastating 1887 phylloxera louse infestation, modern science and technology adapted and industrial wine production and wine consumption now occur throughout the world..The origins of wine predate written records, and modern archaeology is still uncertain about the details of the first cultivation of wild grapevines.It has been hypothesized that early humans climbed trees to pick berries, liked their sugary flavor, and then began collecting them.After a few days with fermentation setting in, juice at the bottom of any container would begin producing low-alcohol wine.According to this theory, things changed around 10,000\u20138000 BC with the transition from a nomadic to a sedentary style of living, which led to agriculture and wine domestication.[22].Wild grapes grow in the Caucasus region (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia), the northern Levant, coastal and southeastern Turkey, and northern Iran.", "List of districts of West Bengal": "The Himalayas lies in the  north of West Bengal and the Bay of Bengal is at the south.Between them, the river Ganga flows eastwards and its main distributary, the Hooghly River, flows south to reach the Bay of Bengal.The Siliguri Corridor, which connects North-East India with rest of the India, lies in the North Bengal region of the state.Geographically, West Bengal is divided into a variety of regions\u2014Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, Terai and Dooars region, North Bengal plains, Rarh region, Western plateau and high lands, coastal plains, Sundarbans and the Ganga Delta.[1].In 1947, when India gained independence, the state of West Bengal was formed, with 14 districts, as per partition plan of the then Bengal province of British India.[2][3] The former princely state Koch Bihar joined as a district on 26 January 1950,[4] and the former French enclave Chandannagore joined as part of the Hooghly district in 1954.[5] The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 led to addition of Purulia district to the state and to enlargement of West Dinajpur district.[6] Later, larger districts such as West Dinajpur, 24 Parganas and Midnapore were bifurcated..West Bengal is now divided into 23 districts which includes the newly formed Alipurduar district (formed on 25 June 2014), Kalimpong district (formed on 14 February 2017), Jhargram district (formed on 4 April 2017), and the splitting of the former Bardhaman district into Purba Bardhaman district and  Paschim Bardhaman district (formed on 7 April 2017).The districts are grouped into five divisions.[7][8].Divisions are administered by Divisional Commissioners.[9] Kolkata, the capital of the state, constitutes the Kolkata district.Other districts are further divided into administrative units such as subdivisions and blocks, administered by SDO and BDO, respectively.The Panchayati Raj has a three-tier structure in the state.The atomic unit is called a Gram Panchayat, which is the Panchayat organisation for a collection of villages.[10] The block-level organisations are called Panchayat Samiti,[11] and the district-level organisations are named Zilla Parishad.[12].The West Bengal cabinet has approved the creation of seven new districts on 1 August 2022.", "Caribbean": "The Caribbean (/\u02cck\u00e6r\u026a\u02c8bi\u02d0\u0259n,

Cara\u00efben) is a subregion of the Americas that includes the Caribbean Sea and its islands, some of which are surrounded by the Caribbean Sea[5] and some of which border both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean;[6] the nearby coastal areas on the mainland are often also included in the region.The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America..Situated largely on the Caribbean Plate, the region has more than 700 islands, islets, reefs, and cays.Island arcs delineate the northern and eastern edges of the Caribbean Sea:[7] the Greater Antilles in the north and the Lesser Antilles, which includes the Leeward Antilles, in the east and south.The nearby Lucayan Archipelago, comprising The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, is considered to be a part of the Caribbean despite not bordering the Caribbean Sea.All the islands in the Antilles plus the Lucayan Archipelago form the West Indies, which is often interchangeable with the term Caribbean.On the mainland, Belize, the eastern and northern coasts of Central and South American countries such as the Bay Islands Department of Honduras, the North and South Caribbean Autonomous Regions of Nicaragua, the Lim\u00f3n Province of Costa Rica, Col\u00f3n Province of Panama, and the Archipelago of San Andr\u00e9s, Providencia and Santa Catalina in Colombia are also considered culturally Caribbean.[8] Guyana, French Guiana and Suriname are often included as parts of the Caribbean due to their political and cultural ties with the region..Geopolitically, the islands of the Caribbean are often regarded as a subregion of North America, though sometimes they are included in Middle America or left as a subregion of their own[9][10] and are organized into 33 political entities, including 13 sovereign states, 12 dependencies, one disputed territory, and seven other overseas territories.From December 15, 1954, to October 10, 2010, there was a territory known as the Netherlands Antilles composed of five islands, all of which were Dutch dependencies.[11] From January 3, 1958, to May 31, 1962, there was also a short-lived political union called the West Indies Federation composed of ten English-speaking Caribbean territories, all of which were then British dependencies..Due to a history of waves of immigration brought by colonization by the Spanish, English, Dutch, and French, the Atlantic slave trade from Africa, and Indentured servitude from Asia, as well as modern immigration, the modern Caribbean is one of the most ethnically diverse regions on the planet..The region takes its name from that of the Caribs, an ethnic group present in the Lesser Antilles and parts of adjacent South America at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Americas.[12].The two most prevalent pronunciations of \"Caribbean\" outside the Caribbean are /\u02cck\u00e6r\u026a\u02c8bi\u02d0\u0259n/ (KARR-\u0259-BEE-\u0259n), with the

state located in the Northeastern United States.It is divided into 234 municipalities, including 221 towns and 13 cities.New Hampshire is organized along the New England town model, where the state is nearly completely incorporated and divided into towns, some of which the state has designated as \"cities\".For each town/city, the table lists the county to which it belongs, its date of incorporation, its population according to the 2010 census, its form of government, and its principal villages.Cities are indicated in boldface.Cities and towns are treated identically under state law..New Hampshire also has a small number of townships, grants, gores and other unincorporated areas which are not part of any municipality.These are small and rare, with most located in Co\u00f6s County, and cover a small amount of the land and population of the state..Historically, the distinction between towns and cities was the form of government.Towns are led by a board of selectmen, who enforce municipal ordinances enacted during town meetings.Cities are led by a mayor, who enforces ordinances passed by a city council or a board of aldermen.City charters are granted by special act of the New Hampshire General Court.", "Slavery in Africa": "Slavery has historically been widespread in Africa.Systems of servitude and slavery were common in parts of Africa in ancient times, as they were in much of the rest of the ancient world.[1] When the trans-Saharan slave trade, Indian Ocean slave trade and Atlantic slave trade (which started in the 16th century) began, many of the pre-existing local African slave systems began supplying captives for slave markets outside Africa.[2][3] Slavery in contemporary Africa is still practiced despite it being illegal..In the relevant literature African slavery is categorized into indigenous slavery and export slavery, depending on whether or not slaves were traded beyond the continent.[4].Slavery in historical Africa was practised in many different forms: Debt slavery, enslavement of war captives, military slavery, slavery for prostitution, and enslavement of criminals were all practised in various parts of Africa.[5] Slavery for domestic and court purposes was widespread throughout Africa.Plantation slavery also occurred, primarily on the eastern coast of Africa and in parts of West Africa.The importance of domestic plantation slavery increased during the 19th century, due to the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade.Many African states dependent on the international slave trade reoriented their economies towards legitimate commerce worked by slave labour.[6].Multiple forms of slavery and servitude have existed throughout African history, and were shaped by indigenous practices of slavery as well as the Roman institution of slavery (and the later Christian views on slavery), the Islamic institutions of slavery via the Muslim slave trade, and eventually the Atlantic slave trade.[2] Slavery was a part of the economic structure of African societies for many centuries, although the extent varied.[2] Ibn Battuta, who visited the ancient kingdom of Mali in the mid-14th century, recounts that the local inhabitants vied with each other in the number of slaves and servants they had, and was himself given a slave boy as a \"hospitality gift.\"[7] In sub-Saharan Africa, the slave relationships were often complex, with rights and freedoms given to individuals held in slavery and restrictions on sale and treatment by their masters.[8] Many communities had hierarchies between different types of slaves: for example, differentiating between those who had been born into slavery and those who had been captured through war.[9].\"The slaves in Africa, I suppose, are nearly in the proportion of three to one to the freemen.They claim no reward for their services except food and clothing, and are treated with kindness or severity, according to the good or bad disposition of their masters.Custom, however, has established certain rules with regard to the treatment of slaves, which it is thought dishonourable to violate.Thus the domestic slaves, or such as are born in a man\u2019s own house, are treated with more lenity than those which are purchased with money.", "Brett Favre": "Brett Lorenzo Favre (/f\u0251\u02d0rv/ \u24d8 FARV; born October 10, 1969) is an American former football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 20 seasons, primarily with the Green Bay Packers.Favre had 321 consecutive starts from 1992 to 2010, including 297 regular season games, the most in league history.He was also the first NFL quarterback to obtain 70,000 yards, 10,000 passes, 6,000 completions, 500 touchdowns, and victories over all 32 teams..Favre played college football at the University of Southern Mississippi and was selected in the second round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons, where he spent one season as a backup.Traded to the Packers, he became their starter early in the 1992 season and revitalized a franchise that had been in a period of decline since the late 1960s.During his 16 seasons with Green Bay, he led the team to 11 playoff appearances, seven division titles, four NFC Championship Games, two consecutive Super Bowl appearances, and one championship title in Super Bowl XXXI, the team's first in nearly three decades.Favre was traded in 2008 to the New York Jets, where he played one year, and spent his final two seasons with the Minnesota Vikings.His 2009 campaign for the Vikings saw him guide them to a division title and NFC Championship Game appearance, while having one of his strongest statistical seasons..At the time of his retirement, Favre was the NFL leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns, and quarterback wins, and holds the record for interceptions.[1] From 1995 to 1997, he was named Most Valuable Player three times, the most the award was consecutively received.Favre also received 11 Pro Bowl and three first-team All-Pro selections.He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016..In 2022, Favre began to face controversy for the Mississippi welfare funds scandal after investigations determined $8 million intended for welfare programs went to Favre or causes he championed.[2] Favre has denied the allegations and filed a defamation lawsuit against the State Auditor of Mississippi and two media personalities over their coverage of him.[3].", "Salesforce.com": "Salesforce, Inc.is an American cloud-based software company headquartered in San Francisco, California.It provides customer relationship management (CRM) software and applications focused on sales, customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, analytics, and application development..Founded by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff in February 1999, Salesforce grew quickly, making its IPO in 2004.As of September 2022, Salesforce is the 61st largest company in the world by market cap with a value of nearly US$153 billion.[2] It became the world's largest enterprise software firm in 2022.[3] Salesforce ranked 136th on the most recent edition of the Fortune 500, making[clarification needed] US$26.5billion in 2022.[4] Since 2020, Salesforce has also been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[5].Salesforce was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, together with Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a software as a service (SaaS) company.[6][7] Two of Salesforce's earliest investors were Larry Ellison, the co-founder and first CEO of Oracle, and Halsey Minor, the founder of CNET.[7].Salesforce was severely affected by the dot-com bubble bursting at the beginning of the new millennium, with the company laying off 20% of its workforce.Despite its losses, Salesforce continued strong during the early 2000s.Salesforce also gained notability during this period for its \"the end of software\" tagline and marketing campaign, in which it also hired actors to hold up signs with its slogan outside a Siebel Systems conference.[8] Salesforce's revenue continued to increase from 2000 to 2003, with 2003's revenue skyrocketing from $5.4 million in the fiscal year 2001 to over $100 million by December 2003.[9].Also in 2003, Salesforce held its first annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco.[10] In June 2004, the company had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110million.[11][12] In 2006, Salesforce launched IdeaExchange, a platform that allows customers to connect with company product managers.[13].In 2009, Salesforce passed $1 billion in annual revenue.[7] Also, in 2009, the company launched Service Cloud, an application that helps companies manage service conversations about their products and services.[14].In 2014, the company released Trailhead, a free online learning platform.[15] In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform.[16] In September 2016, Salesforce announced the launch of Einstein, an artificial intelligence platform that supports several of Salesforce's cloud services.[17][18].", "Seahorse": "A seahorse (also written sea-horse and sea horse) is any of 46 species of small marine fish in the genus Hippocampus.\"Hippocampus\" comes from the Ancient Greek hipp\u00f3kampos (\u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03cc\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2), itself from h\u00edppos (\u1f35\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \"horse\" and k\u00e1mpos (\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \"sea monster\"[4][5] or \"sea animal\".[6] Having a head and neck suggestive of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile tail.[7] Along with the pipefishes and seadragons (Phycodurus and Phyllopteryx) they form the family Syngnathidae..Seahorses are mainly found in shallow tropical and temperate salt water throughout the world, from about 45\u00b0S to 45\u00b0N.[8] They live in sheltered areas such as seagrass beds, estuaries, coral reefs, and mangroves.Four species are found in Pacific waters from North America to South America.In the Atlantic, Hippocampus erectus ranges from Nova Scotia to Uruguay.H.zosterae, known as the dwarf seahorse, is found in the Bahamas..Colonies have been found in European waters such as the Thames Estuary.[9].Three species live in the Mediterranean Sea: H.guttulatus (the long-snouted seahorse), H.hippocampus (the short-snouted seahorse), and H.fuscus (the sea pony).", "Earth": "Land: 148940000km2(57510000sqmi) \u2013 29.2%.Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water.Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust.The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere.Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined.Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation..Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry.It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen.Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet.The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light.", "Magical tools in Wicca": "In the neopagan religion of Wicca a range of magical tools are used in ritual practice.[1] Each of these tools has different uses and associations and are commonly used at an altar, inside a magic circle..In the traditional system of Gardnerian magic, there was as an established idea of covens which were groups composed of initiated members that conducted rituals involving magical tools and secret books (Book of Shadows).These tools were predominately kept within a specific coven because they were considered sacred.These items were owned and used by individual Wiccans, but could also be used collectively by the coven..This practice may derive partly from Masonic traditions (such as the use of the Square and Compasses), from which Wicca draws some material,[2] and partly from the rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.The latter made much use of material from medieval grimoires such as the Key of Solomon, which has many illustrations of magical tools and instructions for their preparation.[3].In Wicca, magical tools are used during rituals which both honour the deities and work magic.The general idea is that the tool directs psychic energies to perform a certain action..In modern-day Wicca, there is an encouragement of solitary practice of rituals and study.Covens are still a part of Wicca and related doctrines but there is now insistence that solitary practice is permissible.The allowance of solitary practice is clearly an important factor in terms of the growth of adherents, as the requirement to join a coven would involve transaction costs of locating fellow members and/or being initiated..In Gardnerian Wicca as laid down by Gerald Gardner, someone who had been initiated in the first degree had to create (or, alternately purchase and then engrave) their own ritual tools.", "Cellular respiration": "Cellular respiration is the process by which biological fuels are oxidized in the presence of an inorganic electron acceptor, such as oxygen, to drive the bulk production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which contains energy.Cellular respiration may be described as a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from nutrients into ATP, and then release waste products.[1].Cellular respiration is a vital process that happens in the cells of living organisms, including humans, plants, and animals.It's how cells produce energy to power all the activities necessary for life..The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, producing large amounts of energy (ATP).Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity.The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions.Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it is an unusual one because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions..Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent is molecular oxygen (O2).The chemical energy stored in ATP (the bond of its third phosphate group to the rest of the molecule can be broken allowing more stable products to form, thereby releasing energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes..Aerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP.Although carbohydrates, fats and proteins  are consumed as reactants, aerobic respiration is the preferred method of pyruvate production in glycolysis, and requires pyruvate to the mitochondria in order to be fully oxidized by the citric acid cycle.", "Fire extinguisher": "A fire extinguisher is a handheld active fire protection device usually filled with a dry or wet chemical used to extinguish or control small fires, often in emergencies.It is not intended for use on an out-of-control fire, such as one which has reached the ceiling, endangers the user (i.e., no escape route, smoke, explosion hazard, etc.), or otherwise requires the equipment, personnel, resources or expertise of a fire brigade.Typically, a fire extinguisher consists of a hand-held cylindrical pressure vessel containing an agent that can be discharged to extinguish a fire.Fire extinguishers manufactured with non-cylindrical pressure vessels also exist but are less common..There are two main types of fire extinguishers: stored-pressure and cartridge-operated.In stored pressure units, the expellant is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself.Depending on the agent used, different propellants are used.With dry chemical extinguishers, nitrogen is typically used; water and foam extinguishers typically use air.Stored pressure fire extinguishers are the most common type.Cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the expellant gas in a separate cartridge that is punctured before discharge, exposing the propellant to the extinguishing agent.This type is not as common, used primarily in areas such as industrial facilities, where they receive higher-than-average use.They have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge, allowing an operator to discharge the extinguisher, recharge it, and return to the fire in a reasonable amount of time.", "Native Americans in the United States": "Native Americans, sometimes called American Indians, First Americans or Indigenous Americans, are the Indigenous peoples of the United States or portions thereof, such as American Indians from the contiguous United States and Alaska Natives.The United States Census Bureau defines Native American as \"all people indigenous to the United States and its territories, including Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islanders, whose data are published separately from American Indians and Alaska Natives\".[4] The US census tracks data from American Indians and Alaska Native separately from Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islanders,[4] who include Samoan Americans and Chamorros..The European colonization of the Americas that began in 1492 resulted in a precipitous decline in Native American population because of newly introduced diseases (including weaponized diseases and biological warfare by European colonizers[5][6][7][8][9]), wars, ethnic cleansing, and enslavement.After its formation, the United States, as part of its policy of settler colonialism, continued to wage war and perpetrated massacres against many Native American peoples, removed them from their ancestral lands, and subjected them to one-sided treaties and to discriminatory government policies.These later focused on forced assimilation, into the 20th century.[10][11][12].When the United States was created, established Native American tribes were generally considered semi-independent nations, as they generally lived in communities separate from white settlers.The federal government signed treaties at a government-to-government level until the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 ended recognition of independent Native nations, and started treating them as \"domestic dependent nations\" subject to applicable federal laws.This law did preserve the rights and privileges agreed to under the treaties, including a large degree of tribal sovereignty.For this reason, many Native American reservations are still independent of state law and the actions of tribal citizens on these reservations are subject only to tribal courts and federal law, often differently applicable to tribal lands than to U.S.state or territory by exemption, exclusion, treaty, or superseding tribal or federal law.The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted U.S.citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States who had not yet obtained it.", "Central america": "Central America[b] is a subregion of the Americas.[2] Its political boundaries are defined as bordering Mexico to the north, Colombia to the south, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.Central America usually consists of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.Within Central America is the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala to central Panama.Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a high amount of seismic activity in the region, such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which has resulted in death, injury, and property damage..In the pre-Columbian era, Central America was inhabited by the Indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east.Following the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus' voyages to the Americas, Spain began to colonize the Americas.From 1609 to 1821, the majority of Central American territories (except for what would become Belize and Panama, and including the modern Mexican state of Chiapas) were governed by the viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala.On 24 August 1821, Spanish Viceroy Juan de O'Donoj\u00fa signed the Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba, which established New Spain's independence from Spain.[3] On 15 September 1821, the Act of Independence of Central America was enacted to announce Central America's separation from the Spanish Empire and provide for the establishment of a new Central American state.Some of New Spain's provinces in the Central American region (i.e.what would become Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica) were annexed to the First Mexican Empire; however in 1823 they seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America until 1838.[4].In 1838, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua became the first of Central America's seven states to become independent countries, followed by El Salvador in 1841, Panama in 1903, and Belize in 1981.[5] Despite the dissolution of the Federal Republic of Central America, countries like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua continue to maintain a Central American identity.[6] The Belizeans are usually identified as culturally Caribbean rather than Central American, while the Panamanians identify themselves more broadly with their South American neighbours.[citation needed].The Spanish-speaking countries officially include both North America and South America as a single continent, Am\u00e9rica, which is split into four subregions: North America (Northern America and Mexico), Central America, South America, and Insular America (the West Indies).[7].", "Scrubs (TV series)": "Scrubs (stylized as [scrubs]) is an American sitcom created by Bill Lawrence that aired from October 2, 2001, to March 17, 2010, on NBC and later ABC.The series follows the lives of employees at the fictional Sacred Heart Hospital, which is a teaching hospital.The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters are medical interns..The series was noted for its fast-paced slapstick and surreal vignettes presented mostly as the daydreams of the central character, John \"J.D.\" Dorian, played by Zach Braff.The main cast for all but its last season consisted of Braff, Sarah Chalke, Donald Faison, Neil Flynn, Ken Jenkins, John C.McGinley, and Judy Reyes.The series featured multiple guest appearances by film actors, such as Brendan Fraser, Heather Graham, Michael J.Fox and Colin Farrell..Although season eight's \"My Finale\" was conceived and filmed as a series finale, the show was eventually revived for a ninth season, subtitled Med School, with the setting moved to a medical school, and new cast members introduced.Of the original cast, only Braff, Faison, and McGinley remained regular cast members, while the others, with the exception of Reyes, made guest appearances; Kerry Bish\u00e9, Eliza Coupe, Dave Franco, and Michael Mosley became series regulars, with Bish\u00e9 becoming the show's new narrator..Scrubs, produced by ABC Studios (formerly Touchstone Television), premiered on October 2, 2001, on NBC.The series received a Peabody Award in 2006.", "Steam engine": "A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid.The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder.This pushing force can be transformed, by a connecting rod and crank, into rotational force for work.The term \"steam engine\" is generally applied only to reciprocating engines as just described, not to the steam turbine.Steam engines are external combustion engines,[1] where the working fluid is separated from the combustion products.The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle.In general usage, the term steam engine can refer to either complete steam plants (including boilers etc.), such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines, or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone, as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine..Steam-driven devices were known as early as the aeolipile, Ball of Aeolus, in the first century AD, with a few other uses recorded in the 16th century.In 1606 Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont patented his invention of the first steam-powered water pump for draining mines.[2] Thomas Savery is considered the inventor of the first commercially used steam powered device, a steam pump that used steam pressure operating directly on the water.The first commercially successful engine that could transmit continuous power to a machine was developed in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen.James Watt made a critical improvement in 1764, by removing spent steam to a separate vessel for condensation, greatly improving the amount of work obtained per unit of fuel consumed.By the 19th century, stationary steam engines powered the factories of the Industrial Revolution.", "Move Bitch": "\"Move Bitch\" (marketed as \"Move B***h\" or simply \"Move\") is the fourth official single from American rapper Ludacris' album Word of Mouf.The single features American rappers Mystikal and I-20.The single reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100,[1] making it Ludacris's first top-ten hit on the chart.It also reached number 3 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart[2] and number 3 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart.[3]  Also, it featured in an episode of the TV series Castle.Retired NBA star and now ESPN analyst Jalen Rose is featured in the music video..The song has been covered by rock band Start Trouble, on their album Every Solution Has Its Problem.It was sampled by Girl Talk on the first track of his album All Day, \"Oh No\".Puerto Rican reggaeton duo Maicol & Manuel sampled the song on \"Hoy Me Levant\u00e9\" on their 2002 release Yakaleo.German Hip Hop group 257ers  has sampled the song on Aus Dem Weg of the album Boomshakkalakka..The song was referenced in chants by people protesting U.S.President George W.Bush, who changed the words to \u201cMove, Bush, get out the way!\u201d starting with protests of the 2003 Iraq War.[4][5][6].", "Elizabeth II": "ElizabethII (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21April 1926\u2013 8September 2022) was Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 6February 1952 until her death in 2022.She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states over the course of her lifetime and remained the monarch of 15 realms by the time of her death.Her reign of over 70 years is the longest of any British monarch and the longest verified reign of any female head of state in history..Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King GeorgeV.She was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King GeorgeVI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother).Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother EdwardVIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive.She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service.In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021.They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward..When her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth\u2014then 25 years old\u2014became queen of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka), as well as head of the Commonwealth.Elizabeth reigned as a constitutional monarch through major political changes such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, devolution in the United Kingdom, the decolonisation of Africa, and the United Kingdom's accession to the European Communities and withdrawal from the European Union.The number of her realms varied over time as territories gained independence and some realms became republics.", "Christianity in Australia": "Christianity is the largest religion in Australia, with a total of 43.9% of the nation-wide population identifying with a Christian denomination in the 2021 census.The first presence of Christianity in Australia coincided with the colonial invasion and beginning of the frontier wars in what came to be known as New South Wales in 1788..The Christian footprint in Australian society and culture remains broad, particularly in areas of social welfare and education provision and in the marking of festivals such as Easter and Christmas.Though the Australian Constitution of 1901 protects freedom of religion and separation of church and state, the Church of England held legal privileges in the early colonial period, when Catholicism in particular was suppressed, and sectarianism was a feature of Australian politics well into the 20th century, as was collaboration by church and state in seeking the conversion of the indigenous population to Christianity.Today, the Catholic Church is second only to government itself as a provider of government-funded social services, through organisations such as Catholic Social Services Australia and the St Vincent De Paul Society.The Anglican Church's Anglicare network is similarly engaged in areas such as emergency relief, aged care, family support service and help for the homeless.Other denominations assist through networks like UnitingCare Australia and the Salvation Army, and around a quarter of students attend church owned schools..Historically significant Australian Christians[1] have included the Reverend John Dunmore Lang, Saint Mary MacKillop, Catherine Helen Spence, Pastor David Unaipon, the Reverend John Flynn, Pastor Sir Doug Nicholls and General Eva Evelyn Burrows of the Salvation Army.High-profile contemporary Australian Christians include Tim Costello; Baptist minister and current CEO of World Vision Australia; Frank Brennan, Jesuit human rights lawyer; John Dickson, historian and founder of The Centre for Public Christianity; Phillip Aspinall the current Archbishop of Brisbane, Philip Freier the current Anglican Primate of Australia and Archbishop of Melbourne; and recent Prime Ministers John Howard, Kevin Rudd, Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison..Like much of the Western world, Australia has been affected by the widespread decline in religiosity that has lowered the number of professing Christians and a diversifying immigration intakes that have lowered the overall percentage that Christians comprise in the Australian population, resulting in a national census decline from 96.1% at the time of the Federation of Australia in the 1901 census, to 43.9% in the 2021 census Census..According to the 2021 census, religious distribution is as follows:.Post-war immigration has grown the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia and there are large and growing Pentecostal groups, such as Sydney's Hillsong Church.", "Yale university": "Yale University is a private Ivy League research university in New Haven, Connecticut.Founded in 1701, Yale is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[7].The Collegiate School was established in 1701 by Congregationalist clergy of the Connecticut Colony.At first restricted to instructing ministers in theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution.In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887.Yale's faculty and student populations grew rapidly after 1890 with expansion of the physical campus and of scientific research programs..Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools.[8] While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs.In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England.As of 2021[update], the university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion, the third largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[9][10] Student athletes compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference..As of October2020[update], 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing Award winners have been affiliated with Yale University.In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S.presidents, 10 Founding Fathers, 19 U.S.", "Artemisia tridentata": "Artemisia tridentata, commonly called big sagebrush,[2] Great Basin sagebrush[2] or (locally) simply sagebrush, is an aromatic shrub from the family Asteraceae, which grows in arid and semi-arid conditions, throughout a range of cold desert, steppe, and mountain habitats in the Intermountain West of North America.The vernacular name \"sagebrush\" is also used for several related members of the genus Artemisia, such as California sagebrush (Artemisia californica)..Big sagebrush and other Artemisia shrubs are the dominant plant species across large portions of the Great Basin.The range extends northward through British Columbia's southern interior, south into Baja California, and east into the western Great Plains of New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska, and the Dakotas.[3][4].Several major threats exist to sagebrush ecosystems, including human settlements, conversion to agricultural land, invasive plant species, and  wildfires..Sagebrush provides food and habitat for a variety of species, such as sage grouse, pronghorn antelope, grey vireo, pygmy rabbit, and mule deer.It is especially important to game animals during the winter.[5].Native Americans have used the plant medicinally.It is also useful as firewood..Big sagebrush is a coarse, many-branched, pale-grey shrub with yellow flowers and silvery-grey foliage, which is generally 0.5\u20133 metres (1+1\u20442\u201310 feet) tall.[6] A deep taproot 1\u20134m (3+1\u20442\u201313ft) in length, coupled with laterally spreading roots near the surface, allows sagebrush to gather water from both surface precipitation and the water table several meters beneath.Big sagebrush that is over a meter tall is an indicator of arable land, because it prefers deep, basic soils.[7] Sagebrush is generally long-lived once it makes it past the seedling stage, and can reach ages of over 100 years.[8].The species has a strong pungent fragrance (especially when wet) due to the presence of camphor, terpenoids and other volatile oils.[9] The taste is bitter and, together with the odor, serves to discourage browsing by many herbivores.", "Yahoo! Mail": "Yahoo! Mail (also written as Yahoo Mail) is an email service offered by the American company Yahoo, Inc.The service is free for personal use, with an optional monthly fee for additional features.Business email was previously available with the Yahoo! Small Business brand, before it transitioned to Verizon Small Business Essentials in early 2022.Launched on October 8, 1997, as of January 2020, Yahoo! Mail has 225 million users.[4].Users are able to access and manage their mailboxes using webmail interface, accessible using a standard web browser.Some accounts also supported the use of standard mail protocols (POP3 and SMTP).Since 2015, users can also connect non-Yahoo e-mail accounts to the webmail client.[5].New Yahoo! Mail accounts, and most of the service's accounts, use yahoo.com as the email suffix.Previously, users could choose ymail.com or rocketmail.com as a suffix,[6] or one of several country-specific suffixes.Many countries were available, such as yahoo.co.uk in the United Kingdom, yahoo.fr in France (also used by francophones) and yahoo.it in Italy.While these suffixes are discontinued for new accounts, they are preserved for existing accounts.[7] Yahoo! Japan Mail, a separate service, offers both yahoo.co.jp and ymail.ne.jp as suffixes.[8] Internet service providers using Yahoo! Mail offer their own suffixes for subscribers, with AT&T also offering free accounts to non-subscribers.[9].Yahoo! made a deal with the online communications company Four11 for co-branded white pages.", "Tacoma, Washington": "Tacoma (/t\u0259\u02c8ko\u028am\u0259/ t\u0259-KOH-m\u0259) is the county seat of Pierce County, Washington, United States.[7] A port city, it is situated along Washington's Puget Sound, 32 miles (51km) southwest of Seattle, 31 miles (50km) northeast of the state capital, Olympia, and 58 miles (93km) northwest of Mount Rainier National Park.The city's population was 219,346 at the time of the 2020 census.[2] Tacoma is the second-largest city in the Puget Sound area and the third-most populous in the state.Tacoma also serves as the center of business activity for the South Sound region, which has a population of about 1 million..Tacoma adopted its name after the nearby Mount Rainier, called t\u0259\u02e1q\u02b7u\u0294b\u0259\u0294 in the Puget Sound Salish dialect, and \u201cTakhoma\u201d in an anglicized version.It is locally known as the \"City of Destiny\" because the area was chosen to be the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the late 19th century.The decision of the railroad was influenced by Tacoma's neighboring deep-water harbor, Commencement Bay.By connecting the bay with the railroad, Tacoma's motto became \"When rails meet sails\".Commencement Bay serves the Port of Tacoma, a center of international trade on the Pacific Coast and Washington's largest port.The city gained notoriety in 1940 for the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which earned the nickname \"Galloping Gertie\" due to the vertical movement of the deck during windy conditions..Like most industrial cities, Tacoma suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of suburbanization and divestment.Since the 1990s, downtown Tacoma has experienced a period of revitalization.Developments in the downtown include the University of Washington Tacoma; the T Line (formerly Tacoma Link), the first modern electric light rail service in the state; the state's highest density of art and history museums; and a restored urban waterfront, the Thea Foss Waterway..", "Chula Vista, California": "Chula Vista (/\u02cct\u0283u\u02d0l\u0259 \u02c8v\u026ast\u0259/ CHOO-l\u0259 VIST-\u0259; Spanish for 'Beautiful/Pretty View',[9][10][11][12] pronounced [\u02c8t\u0283ula \u02c8\u03b2ista]) is a city in San Diego County, California, United States.It is also the second-largest city in the San Diego metropolitan area, the seventh largest city in Southern California, the fifteenth largest city in the state of California, and the 78th-largest city in the United States.The population was 275,487 as of the 2020 census,[8] up from 243,916 as of the 2010 census.[13] Located about halfway\u20147.5 miles (12.1km)\u2014between the two downtowns of San Diego and Tijuana in the South Bay, the city is at the center of one of the richest culturally diverse zones in the United States.Chula Vista is so named because of its scenic location between the San Diego Bay and coastal mountain foothills..The area, along with San Diego, was inhabited by the Kumeyaay before contact from the Spanish, who later claimed the area.In 1821, Chula Vista became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire, which reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later.California became part of the United States in 1848 as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850..Founded in the early 19th century and incorporated in October 1911, fast population growth has recently been observed in the city.Located in the city is one of America's few year-round United States Olympic Training centers, while popular tourist destinations include Sesame Place San Diego, North Island Credit Union Amphitheatre, the Chula Vista marina, and the Living Coast Discovery Center.[14].Fossils of aquatic life, in the form of a belemnitida from the Jurassic, have been found within the modern borders of Chula Vista.[15] It is not until the Oligocene epoch that land life fossils have been found;[15][16] although Eocene epoch fossils have been found in nearby Bonita.[15] It is not until 10,000 years ago that human activity has been found within the modern borders of Chula Vista, primarily in Otay Valley of the San Dieguito people.[15] The oldest site of human settlement within the modern boundaries of Chula Vista, was named Otai by the Spanish in 1769, and had been occupied as far back as 7,980 years ago.[17] Another place where humans first settled within the modern boundaries of Chula Vista was at the Rolling Hills Site, which dates back to 7,000 years ago.[17].In 3000 BCE, people speaking the Yuman (Quechan) language began moving into the region from the Lower Colorado River Valley and southwestern Arizona portions of the Sonoran desert.Later the Kumeyaay tribe came to populate the land, on which the city sits today, and lived in the area for hundreds of years.[18] The Kumeyaay built a village known as Chiap (or Chyap) which was located by mudflats at the southern end of South Bay.[19].", "Metes and bounds": "Metes and bounds is a system or method of describing land, real property (in contrast to personal property) or real estate.[1]  The system has been used in England for many centuries and is still used there in the definition of general boundaries.The system is also used in the Canadian province of Ontario,[2] and throughout Canada for the description of electoral districts.By custom, it was applied in the original Thirteen Colonies that became the United States and in many other land jurisdictions based on English common law, including Zimbabwe, South Africa, India and Bangladesh.[3] While still in hand-me-down use, this system has been largely overtaken in the past few centuries by newer systems such as rectangular (government survey) and lot and block (recorded plat)..Typically the system uses physical features of the local geography, along with directions and distances, to define and describe the boundaries of a parcel of land.The boundaries are described in a running prose style, working around the parcel in sequence, from a point of beginning, returning to the same point; compare with the oral ritual of beating the bounds.It may include references to other adjoining parcels (and their owners), and it, in turn, could also be referred to in later surveys.At the time the description is compiled, it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monuments..A typical description for a small parcel of land would be: \"Commencing at a corner at the intersection of two stone walls near an apple tree on the north side of Muddy Creek road one mile above the junction of Muddy and Indian Creeks, thence north for 150 rods to the end of the stone wall bordering the road, thence northwest along a line to a large standing rock on the corner of the property now or formerly belonging to John Smith, thence west 150 rods to the corner of a barn near a large oak tree, thence south to Muddy Creek road, thence down the side of the creek road to the point of commencement.\" The sequence begins with an identified corner serving as benchmark.The description then gives distance, direction and various boundary descriptions as if one were walking the bounds pacing off the distance to the next corner where there is a change of direction.Where watercourses form part of the bounds their meander is generally taken as a straight line between the established corners and their monuments..In many deeds, the direction is described not by azimuth (a clockwise degree measure out of 360 degrees) but instead by bearing (a direction north or south followed by a degree measure out of 90 degrees and another direction west or east).For example, such a bearing might be listed as \"N 42\u00b035' W\", which means that the bearing is 42\u00b035' counterclockwise, or west of north.", "Isaac Newton": "Sir Isaac Newton FRS (25 December 1642\u2013 20 March 1726/27)[a] was an English polymath active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher.[7] He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed.His pioneering book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, consolidated many previous results and established classical mechanics.[8][9] Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus, though notably he developed calculus well before Leibniz.[10][11] He is considered one of the greatest and most influential scientists in history.[12][13][14][15][7].In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity.Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity.[16] He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles.Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems..Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum.His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704.He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid.In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves..Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity.He refused to take holy orders in the Church of England, unlike most members of the Cambridge faculty of the day.", "Newton's law of universal gravitation": "Newton's law of universal gravitation is usually stated as that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.[note 1] The publication of the law has become known as the \"first great unification\", as it marked the unification of the previously described phenomena of gravity on Earth with known astronomical behaviors.[1][2][3].This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called inductive reasoning.[4] It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton's work Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (\"the Principia\"), first published on 5 July 1687.When Newton presented Book 1 of the unpublished text in April 1686 to the Royal Society, Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him..The equation for universal gravitation thus takes the form:.where F is the gravitational force acting between two objects, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, r is the distance between the centers of their masses, and G is the gravitational constant..The first test of Newton's law of gravitation between masses in the laboratory was the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798.[5] It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton's Principia and approximately 71 years after his death..Newton's law of gravitation resembles Coulomb's law of electrical forces, which is used to calculate the magnitude of the electrical force arising between two charged bodies.Both are inverse-square laws, where force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies.Coulomb's law has charge in place of mass and a different constant..Newton's law has later been superseded by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, but the universality of the gravitational constant is intact and the law still continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity in most applications.Relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme accuracy, or when dealing with very strong gravitational fields, such as those found near extremely massive and dense objects, or at small distances (such as Mercury's orbit around the Sun)..Around 1600, the scientific method began to take root.", "Casualties of the Iraq War": "Post-invasion insurgency (2003\u20132006).Civil war (2006\u20132008).Estimates of the casualties from the Iraq War (beginning with the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the ensuing occupation and insurgency and civil war) have come in several forms, and those estimates of different types of Iraq War casualties vary greatly..Estimating war-related deaths poses many challenges.[1][2] Experts distinguish between population-based studies, which extrapolate from random samples of the population, and body counts, which tally reported deaths and likely significantly underestimate casualties.[3] Population-based studies produce estimates of the number of Iraq War casualties ranging from 151,000 violent deaths as of June 2006 (per the Iraq Family Health Survey) to 1,033,000 excess deaths (per the 2007 Opinion Research Business (ORB) survey).Other survey-based studies covering different time-spans find 461,000 total deaths (over 60% of them violent) as of June 2011 (per PLOS Medicine 2013), and 655,000 total deaths (over 90% of them violent) as of June 2006 (per the 2006 Lancet study).Body counts counted at least 110,600 violent deaths as of April 2009 (Associated Press).The Iraq Body Count project documents 186,901 \u2013 210,296  violent civilian deaths in their table.All estimates of Iraq War casualties are disputed.[4][5].The tables below summarize reports on Iraqi casualty figures..Overview: Iraqi death estimates by source.Summary of casualties of the Iraq War..Possible estimates on the number of people killed in the invasion and occupation of Iraq vary widely,[15] and are highly disputed.", "Highwayman": "A highwayman was a robber who stole from travellers.This type of thief usually travelled and robbed by horse as compared to a footpad who travelled and robbed on foot; mounted highwaymen were widely considered to be socially superior to footpads.[1] Such criminals operated until the mid- or late 19th century.Highwaywomen, such as Katherine Ferrers, were said to also exist, often dressing as men, especially in fiction.[citation needed].The first attestation of the word highwayman is from 1617.[2] Euphemisms such as \"knights of the road\" and \"gentlemen of the road\" were sometimes used by people interested in romanticizing (with a Robin Hood\u2013esque slant) what was often an especially violent form of stealing.In the 19th-century American West, highwaymen were sometimes known as road agents.[3] In Australia, they were known as bushrangers..The great age of highwaymen was the period from the Restoration in 1660 to the death of Queen Anne in 1714.Some of them are known to have been disbanded soldiers and even officers of the English Civil War and French wars.What favoured them most was the lack of governance and absence of a police force: parish constables were almost wholly ineffective and commonplace detection and arrest were very difficult.Most of the highwaymen held up travellers and took their money.Some had channels by which they could dispose of bills of exchange.Others had a 'racket' on the road transport of an extensive district; carriers regularly paid them a ransom to go unmolested.[4].They often attacked coaches for their lack of protection, including public stagecoaches; the postboys who carried the mail were also frequently held up.[5] The demand to \"Stand and deliver!\" (sometimes in forms such as \"Stand and deliver your purse!\"  \"Stand and deliver your money!\") was in use from the 17th century to the 19th century:.", "Magic Johnson": "Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson Jr.(born August 14, 1959) is an American businessman and former professional basketball player.He is often regarded as the greatest point guard of all time.[3][4][5][6] Johnson played 13 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).After winning a national championship with Michigan State in 1979, Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers, leading the team to five NBA championships during their Showtime era.Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV, but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game, winning the All-Star MVP Award.After protests against his return from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time..Johnson's career achievements include three NBA MVP Awards, three NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Awards, nine NBA Finals appearances, 12 All-Star games, and nine All-NBA First Team selections.He led the league in regular season assists four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game in both the regular season (11.19 assists per game) and the playoffs (12.35 assists per game).[7][8] He also holds the record for most career assists in the playoffs.[9] Johnson was a member of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\"), which won the Olympic gold medal in Barcelona.After leaving the NBA in 1991, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team that traveled around the world playing exhibition games.[10].Johnson was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021, and became a two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\u2014being enshrined in 2002 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as a member of the \"Dream Team\".[11] His friendship and rivalry with Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, whom he faced in the 1979 NCAA finals and three NBA championship series, are well documented..Since his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and safe sex,[12] as well as an entrepreneur,[13] philanthropist,[14] broadcaster and motivational speaker.[15] Johnson is a former part-owner of the Lakers and was the team's president of basketball operations in the late 2010s.He is a founding member of Guggenheim Baseball Management, managing entity of the MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers, and also owns stakes in the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, the MLS' Los Angeles FC, and the NFL's Washington Commanders.", "Cell (biology)": "The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all forms of life.Every cell consists of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, and contains many macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA, as well as many small molecules of nutrients and metabolites.[1] The term comes from the Latin word cellula meaning 'small room'.[2].Cells can acquire specified function and carry out various tasks within the cell such as replication, DNA repair, protein synthesis, and motility.Cells are capable of specialization and mobility within the cell..Most plant and animal cells are only visible under a light microscope, with dimensions between 1 and 100micrometres.[3] Electron microscopy gives a much higher resolution showing greatly detailed cell structure.Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell such as bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals).[4] Most unicellular organisms are classed as microorganisms..The study of cells and how they work has led to many other studies in related areas of biology, including: discovery of DNA, cancer systems biology, aging and developmental biology..Cell biology is the study of cells, which were discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, who named them for their resemblance to cells inhabited by Christian monks in a monastery.[5][6] Cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells.[7] Cells emerged on Earth about 4 billion years ago.[8][9][10][11].With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology became advanced enough to discover cells.This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, known as cell biology.When observing a piece of cork under the scope, he was able to see pores.This was shocking at the time as it was believed no one else had seen these.", "Grecian Formula": "Grecian Formula is a men's hair coloring product from Combe Incorporated.Until 2018 (see below) the formulation used in the United States contained lead(II) acetate.[1] Because lead acetate was banned in cosmetics in Canada and the European Union, the formulations sold there did not contain it.[1][2] In 2017 the Environmental Defense Fund and other consumer groups filed a complaint with the Food and Drug Administration to force the removal of lead acetate from Grecian Formula and other hair dyes.[3] As of July 2018, ingredients of Grecian Formula are water, isopropyl alcohol, triethanolamine, bismuth citrate, sodium thiosulfate, fragrance, and panthenol.Lead acetate has been replaced by bismuth citrate as the progressive colorant..This product article is a stub.You can help Wikipedia by expanding

the front of a vehicle to illuminate the road ahead.Headlamps are also often called headlights, but in the most precise usage, headlamp is the term for the device itself and headlight is the term for the beam of light produced and distributed by the device..Headlamp performance has steadily improved throughout the automobile age, spurred by the great disparity between daytime and nighttime traffic fatalities: the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states that nearly half of all traffic-related fatalities occur in the dark, despite only 25% of traffic travelling during darkness.[1].Other vehicles, such as trains and aircraft, are required to have headlamps.Bicycle headlamps are often used on bicycles, and are required in some jurisdictions.They can be powered by a battery or a small generator like a bottle or hub dynamo..The first horseless carriages used carriage lamps, which proved unsuitable for travel at speed.[2] The earliest lights used candles as the most common type of fuel.[3].The earliest headlamps, fuelled by combustible gas such as acetylene gas or oil, operated from the late 1880s.Acetylene gas lamps were popular in 1900s because the flame is resistant to wind and rain.Thick concave mirrors combined with magnifying lenses projected the acetylene flame light.[4] A number of car manufacturers offered Prest-O-Lite calcium carbide acetylene gas generator cylinder with gas feed pipes for lights as standard equipment for 1904 cars..The first electric headlamps were introduced in 1898 on the Columbia Electric Car from the Electric Vehicle Company of Hartford, Connecticut, and were optional.Two factors limited the widespread use of electric headlamps: the short life of filaments in the harsh automotive environment, and the difficulty of producing dynamos small enough, yet powerful enough to produce sufficient current.[5].", "Women's rights": "Women's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls worldwide.They formed the basis for the women's rights movement in the 19th century and the feminist movements during the 20th and 21st centuries.In some countries, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior, whereas in others, they are ignored and suppressed.They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls, in favor of men and boys.[1].Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include the right to bodily integrity and autonomy, to be free from sexual violence, to vote, to hold public office, to enter into legal contracts, to have equal rights in family law, to work, to fair wages or equal pay, to have reproductive rights, to own property, and to education.[2].Women in ancient Sumer could buy, own, sell, and inherit property.[3] They could engage in commerce,[3] and testify in court as witnesses.[3] Nonetheless, their husbands could divorce them for mild infractions,[3] and a divorced husband could easily remarry another woman, provided that his first wife had borne him no offspring.[3] Female deities, such as Inanna, were widely worshipped.[4]:\u200a182\u200a The Akkadian poet Enheduanna, the priestess of Inanna and daughter of Sargon, is the earliest known poet whose name has been recorded.[5] Old Babylonian law codes permitted a husband to divorce his wife under any circumstances,[4]:\u200a140\u200a but doing so required him to return all of her property and sometimes pay her a fine.[4]:\u200a140\u200a Most law codes forbade a woman to request her husband for a divorce and enforced the same penalties on a woman asking for divorce as on a woman caught in the act of adultery.[4]:\u200a140\u200a Some Babylonian and Assyrian laws, however, afforded women the same right to divorce as men, requiring them to pay the same fine.[4]:\u200a140\u200a The majority of East Semitic deities were male.[4]:\u200a179.In ancient Egypt, women enjoyed the same rights under the law as a man, however rightful entitlements depended upon social class.Landed property descended in the female line from mother to daughter, and women were entitled to administer their own property.Women in ancient Egypt could buy, sell, be a partner in legal contracts, be executors in wills and witnesses to legal documents, bring court action, and adopt children.[6].Women during the early Vedic period[7] enjoyed equal status with men in all aspects of life.[8] Works by ancient Indian grammarians such as Patanjali and Katyayana suggest that women were educated in the early Vedic period.[9][10] Rigvedic verses suggest that women married at a mature age and were probably free to select their own husbands in a practice called swayamvar or live-in relationship called Gandharva marriage.[11].Although most women lacked political and equal rights in the city states of ancient Greece, they enjoyed a certain freedom of movement until the Archaic age.[12] Records also exist of women in ancient Delphi, Gortyn, Thessaly, Megara, and Sparta owning land, the most prestigious form of private property at the time.[13] However, after the Archaic age, legislators began to enact laws enforcing gender segregation, resulting in decreased rights for women.[12].Women in Classical Athens had no legal personhood and were assumed to be part of the oikos headed by the male kyrios.", "Whoopi Goldberg": "Caryn Elaine Johnson (born November 13, 1955),[1][2][3] known professionally as Whoopi Goldberg (/\u02c8w\u028api/), is an

n\u0251sj\u0254nal d\u0259 \u0254k\u025b], LNH) is a professional ice hockey league in North America comprising 32 teams\u201425 in the United States and 7 in Canada.The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America,[5] is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.The NHL is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and is considered to be the top ranked professional ice hockey league in the world,[6] with players from 17 countries as of the 2023\u201324season[update].[7] The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) also views the Stanley Cup as one of the \"most important championships available to the sport\".[8].The National Hockey League was organized at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal on November 26, 1917, after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization, the National Hockey Association (NHA), which had been founded in 1909 in Renfrew, Ontario.[9] The NHL immediately took the NHA's place as one of the leagues that contested for the Stanley Cup in an annual interleague competition before a series of league mergers and foldings left the NHL as the only league left competing for the Stanley Cup in 1926..At its inception, the NHL had four teams, all in Canada, thus the adjective \"National\" in the league's name.The league expanded to the United States in 1924, when the Boston Bruins joined, and has since consisted of both American and Canadian teams.From 1942 to 1967, the league had only six teams, collectively (if not contemporaneously) nicknamed the \"Original Six\".The NHL added six new teams to double its size at the 1967 NHL expansion.The league then increased to 18 teams by 1974 and 21 teams in 1979.Between 1991 and 2000, the NHL further expanded to 30 teams.It added its 31st and 32nd teams in 2017 and 2021, respectively..The NHL is the fifth-wealthiest professional sport league in the world by revenue, after the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the English Premier League (EPL).[10] The league's headquarters have been in Midtown Manhattan since 1989, when the head office moved from Montreal.[11] There have been four league-wide work stoppages in NHL history, all occurring after 1992.[12].", "Maggot": "A maggot is the larva of a fly (order Diptera); it is applied in particular to the larvae of Brachycera flies, such as houseflies, cheese flies, and blowflies,[1] rather than larvae of the Nematocera, such as mosquitoes and crane flies..\"Maggot\" is not a technical term and should not be taken as such; in many standard textbooks of entomology, it does not appear in the index at all.[2][3] In many non-technical texts, the term is used for insect larvae in general.Other sources have coined their own definitions; for example: \"The term applies to a grub when all trace of limbs has disappeared\"[4] and \"Applied to the footless larvae of Diptera\".[5] Additionally, in Flies: The Natural History and Diversity of Diptera, the author claims maggots \"are larvae of higher Brachycera (Cyclorrhapha).\"[6].Maggot-like fly larvae are of significance in ecology and medicine; among other roles, various species are prominent in recycling carrion and garbage, attacking crops and foodstuffs, spreading microbial infections, and causing myiasis.Maggots are also particularly important in forensic entomology because their development can help determine the time of death, particularly maggots in the Calliphoridae family.[7].Anglers use maggots usually commercially supplied to catch non-predatory fish..Maggots are the most popular bait for anglers in Europe.[8] Anglers throw handfuls into the \"swim\" they are targeting, attracting the fish to the area.The anglers then use the largest or most attractive maggots on the hook, hoping to be irresistible to the fish.Commercial maggot breeders from the UK sell their maggots to tackle dealers throughout the E.U.and North America..In North America, maggots have been used primarily as ice fishing bait; recently, however, anglers have started using them year-round.[citation needed] Artificial maggots for fishing, either in natural or fluorescent colors, have been developed and are used for trout, panfish, or salmon species.[9].Live maggots of certain species of flies have been used since antiquity for wound debridement.", "Herod the Great": "Herod I[2][3][a] or Herod the Great (c.\u200972 BCE\u2013 c.\u20094 BCE) was a Roman Jewish client king of the Herodian Kingdom of Judea.[4][5][6] He is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea.Among these works are the rebuilding of the Second Temple in Jerusalem and the expansion of its base[7][8][9]\u2014the Western Wall being part of it.Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE Roman\u2013Jewish historian Josephus.[10].Herod also appears in the Christian Gospel of Matthew as the ruler of Judea who orders the Massacre of the Innocents at the time of the birth of Jesus, although most Herod biographers do not believe that this event occurred.[11] Despite his successes, including single-handedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing,[12] he has still been criticized by various historians.His reign polarizes opinion among historians, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, and some viewing it as a reminder of his tyrannical rule.[10].Upon Herod's death, the Romans divided his kingdom among three of his sons and his sister: Herod Archelaus became ethnarch of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea; Herod Antipas became tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea; Philip became tetrarch of territories north and east of the Jordan River; and Salome I was given a toparchy including the cities of Jabneh, Ashdod, and Phasaelis..Herod was born around 72 BCE[13][14] in Idumea, south of Judea.He was the second son of Antipater the Idumaean, a high-ranking official under ethnarch Hyrcanus II, and Cypros, a Nabatean Arab princess from Petra, in present-day Jordan.Herod's father was by descent an Edomite with a Jewish mother; his ancestors had converted to Judaism.Herod was raised as a Jew.[15][16][17][18][19] Strabo, a contemporary of Herod, held that the Idumaeans, whom he identified as of Nabataean origin, constituted the majority of the population of western Judea, where they commingled with the Judaeans and adopted their customs.[20] This is a view shared also by some modern scholarly works which consider Idumaeans as of Arab or Nabataean origins.[21][22][23][24] Thus Herod's ethnic background was Arab on both sides of his family.[15] According to Josephus, Herod was a descendant of Eleazar Maccabeus (Auran) of the Hasmoneans.[25].Herod rose to power largely through his father's good relations with the Roman general and dictator Julius Caesar, who entrusted  Antipater with the public affairs of Judea.[26] Herod was appointed provincial governor of Galilee in c.\u200947 BCE, when he was about either 25 or 28 years old (Greek original: \"15 years of age\").[27] There he faithfully farmed the taxes of that region for the Roman Senate, and he met with success in ridding that region of bandits.[28][29] Antipater's elder son, Phasael, served in the same capacity as governor of Jerusalem.During this time the young Herod cultivated a good relationship with Sextus Caesar, the acting Roman governor of Syria, who appointed Herod as general of Coelesyria and Samaria, greatly expanding his realm of influence.[30] He enjoyed the backing of Rome, but the Sanhedrin condemned his brutality.[3] When yet a private man, Herod had determined to punish Hyrcanus the Hasmonean king, who had once summoned Herod to stand trial for murder, but Herod was restrained from doing so by the intervention of his father and his elder brother..", "ABO blood group system": "The ABO blood group system is used to denote the presence of one, both, or neither of the A and B antigens on erythrocytes.[1] For human blood transfusions, it is the most important of the 44 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusions (ISBT) as of.December 2022.[2][3] A mismatch (very rare in modern medicine) in this, or any other serotype, can cause a potentially fatal adverse reaction after a transfusion, or an unwanted immune response to an organ transplant.[4] The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM antibodies, produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, bacteria, and viruses..The ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901; he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for this discovery.[5] ABO blood types are also present in other primates such as apes and Old World monkeys.[6].The ABO blood types were first discovered by an Austrian physician, Karl Landsteiner, working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna).In 1900, he found that red blood cells would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in test tubes with sera from different persons, and that some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood.[7] He wrote a two-sentence footnote:.The serum of healthy human beings not only agglutinates animal red cells, but also often those of human origin, from other individuals.It remains to be seen whether this appearance is related to inborn differences between individuals or it is the result of some damage of bacterial kind.[8].This was the first evidence that blood variations exist in humans \u2013 it was believed that all humans have similar blood.The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals.Based on this he classified human blood into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C.He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type.Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A.", "1907": "1907 (MCMVII) was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Gregorian calendarand a common year starting on Monday of the Julian calendar, the 1907th year of the

Oregon.Morse is well known for opposing the Democratic Party\u2019s leadership and for his opposition to the Vietnam War on constitutional grounds.[1].Born in Madison, Wisconsin, and educated at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Minnesota Law School, Morse moved to Oregon in 1930 and began teaching at the University of Oregon School of Law.During World War II, he was elected to the U.S.Senate as a Republican; he became an Independent after Dwight D.Eisenhower's election to the presidency in 1952.While an independent, he set a record for performing the third-longest one-person filibuster in the history of the Senate.[2] Morse joined the Democratic Party in February 1955, and was reelected twice while a member of that party..Morse made a brief run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1960.In 1964, Morse was one of two senators to oppose the later-to-become-controversial Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.It authorized the president to take military action in Vietnam without a declaration of war.He continued to speak out against the war in the ensuing years, and lost his 1968 bid for reelection to Bob Packwood, who criticized his strong opposition to the war.Morse made two more bids for reelection to the Senate before his death in 1974..", "Table (parliamentary procedure)": "In parliamentary procedure, the verb to table has the opposite meaning in the United States from that of the rest of the world:.Motions which use the word \"table\" have specific meanings and functions, depending on the parliamentary authority used.The meaning of \"table\" also depends on the context in which it is used..Both the American and the British dialects have the expression \"to table a topic\" as a short way of saying \"to lay a topic on the table\" and \"to make a topic lie on the table\", but these have opposite meanings in the different varieties of the languages.The British meaning is based on the idea of parliamentarians gathering around a table with the bill laid upon so that all may point to sections for discussion.The American sense draws on the image of taking a paper that one has been examining and laying it aside, ending any discussion about it.The phrase \"put on the table\" can have the same meaning of \"making the issue available for debate\" in both dialects.[1][2][3] According to the American Heritage Dictionary, on the table in American English always has the two opposite meanings up for discussion and put aside for consideration at a later date depending on the context.[4].The British meaning of to \"table\" is to begin consideration of a proposal.[1] This comes from the use of the term to describe physically laying legislation on the table in the British Parliament; once an item on the order paper has been laid on the table, it becomes the current subject for debate.[5].The American meaning of \"to table\" is to postpone or suspend consideration of a motion.[1] In American usage, to allow consideration of the topic again, it would have to be \"taken from the table\".The use of expressions such as \"tabling a motion\" for setting aside or killing a main motion can cause confusion due to the usage of such expressions in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, where they have the opposite meaning\u2014that is, to propose a motion for consideration.[6][7] To make the intent clear internationally, the Congressional Quarterly and its associated CQ publications usually follow the word \"table\" (as used in Congress) with the word \"kill\" in parentheses in reporting congressional votes.[8][9].Under Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, the subsidiary motion to lay on the table is properly used only when it is necessary to suspend consideration of a main motion in order to deal with another matter that has come up unexpectedly and which must be dealt with before the pending motion can be properly addressed.[10] It has, however, become common to misuse this motion to end consideration of the pending main motion without debate, or to mistakenly assume that its adoption prevents further consideration of the main motion at all, or until a specified time.[11][12] Using \"table\" as a verb usually indicates misuse of this motion.[13] The book states, \"It is preferable to avoid moving 'to table' a motion, or 'that the motion be tabled.'\"[13].A main motion that has been laid on the table may be taken up again by adoption of a motion to take from the table.[14] A motion can be taken from the table at the same session (or meeting) or at the next session (or meeting) if that session occurs within a quarterly time interval.[15] Otherwise, the motion dies.[15].", "Toy Story 3": "Toy Story 3 is a  2010 American animated

University.Starks was named an NBA All-Star while playing for the New York Knicks in the 1990s..Starks was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma where he attended Tulsa Central High School.[1] At Tulsa Central, Starks played only one year on the basketball team.[2].After high school, he enrolled at Rogers State College in 1984.While at Rogers State, Starks was on the \"taxi squad\" of the basketball team for backups to replace injured or suspended players; taxi squad players did not suit up and instead watched games from the stands.However, Starks was expelled from Rogers State for stealing another student's stereo equipment in retaliation for the student breaking into Starks' dorm room and the college holding him and his roommates financially responsible for the damage.[3] Starks transferred to Northern Oklahoma College in spring 1985, made the basketball team there, and was sentenced to five days in jail for the robbery.He served the sentence during spring break.[4] In the fall of 1985, Starks averaged 11 points per game with Northern Oklahoma but left the college after being caught smoking cannabis in his dorm.[5] Having worked at a Safeway supermarket, Starks enrolled at Tulsa Junior College in the summer of 1986 to pursue a business degree.[6] While playing intramural basketball, he came to the attention of Ken Trickey, the former coach of Oral Roberts University who was then starting a basketball program for Oklahoma Junior College.Starks played there for a season, then earned a scholarship at Oklahoma State University in 1988, where he finished his collegiate career.[2][7].Undrafted in the 1988 NBA draft, Starks signed with the Golden State Warriors in September 1988 as a free agent.However, as the Warriors had drafted fellow shooting guard Mitch Richmond with the fifth overall pick that year, Starks played limited minutes in only 36 games while Richmond won Rookie of the Year..Starks played stints in the Continental Basketball Association (Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets, 1989\u201390) and World Basketball League (Memphis Rockers, 1990\u201391).[2].", "Secure Digital": "Secure Digital, officially abbreviated as SD, is a proprietary, non-volatile, flash memory card format the SD Association (SDA) developed for use in portable devices..The standard was introduced in August 1999 by SanDisk, Panasonic (Matsushita) and Toshiba as an improvement on MultiMediaCards (MMCs).[1] SDs have become an industry standard.The three companies formed SD-3C, LLC, a company that licenses and enforces intellectual property (IP) rights associated with SD memory cards and SD host-and-ancillary products.[2].In January 2000, the companies formed the SD Association (SDA), a non-profit organization to create and promote SD Card standards.[3] As of 2023[update], the SDA has approximately 1,000 member companies.It uses several  SD-3C-owned trademarked logos to enforce compliance with its specifications and denote compatibility.[4].In 1999, SanDisk, Panasonic (Matsushita), and Toshiba agreed to develop and market the Secure Digital (SD) memory card.[5] The card was derived from the MultiMediaCard (MMC) and provided digital rights management (DRM) based on the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) standard and a high memory density.[citation needed].SD was designed to compete with the Memory Stick, a DRM product Sony had released the year before.Toshiba hoped its DRM would encourage music suppliers concerned about piracy to use SD cards.[6].The trademarked SD logo was originally developed for the Super Density Disc, which was the unsuccessful Toshiba entry in the DVD format war.For this reason, the letter \"D\" is styled to resemble an optical disc.[7].At the 2000 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the three companies announced the creation of the SD Association (SDA) to promote SD cards.The SD Association, which was headquartered in San Ramon, California, United States, then had 30 member companies and product manufacturers

for Best Actor.He starred in further romantic comedies such as Notting Hill (1999), Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) and its 2004 sequel, About a Boy (2002), Two Weeks Notice (2002), Love Actually (2003), and Music and Lyrics (2007).[7].Grant began to take against-type parts, starting with multiple roles in The Wachowskis' science fiction film Cloud Atlas (2012).He received critical acclaim for his roles in Florence Foster Jenkins (2016) and Paddington 2 (2017), receiving two nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.[8][9] He took on television roles in the BBC miniseries A Very English Scandal (2018) and the HBO miniseries The Undoing (2020), earning two nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actor.[10] He has also starred in Guy Ritchie's action films, including The Gentlemen (2019)..Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of sarcasm and characteristic physical mannerisms.[11] He has been outspoken about his antipathy towards the profession of acting, his disdain towards the culture of celebrity, and his hostility towards the media.[12][13] He emerged as a prominent critic of the conduct of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation during the News International phone hacking scandal.[14][15][16].Grant was born on 9 September 1960 in Hammersmith, London, the second son of Fynvola Susan MacLean and Captain James Murray Grant.His grandfather, Colonel James Murray Grant, DSO, was decorated for bravery and leadership at Saint-Valery-en-Caux during World War II.[17] Genealogist Antony Adolph has described Grant's family history as \"a colourful Anglo-Scottish tapestry of warriors, empire-builders, and aristocracy.\"[18] His ancestors include Sir Walter Raleigh;[19] William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan; James Stewart;[18][20][21] John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl; Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham; Sir Evan Nepean; and a sister of Prime Minister Spencer Perceval.[22].Grant's father was an officer in the Seaforth Highlanders for eight years in Malaya and Germany.[23] He ran a carpet firm, and pursued hobbies such as golf and watercolour painting; he raised his family in Chiswick, West London, and the Grants lived next to Arlington Park Mansions on Sutton Lane.[24][25] In September 2006, a collection of Capt.", "Han Dynasty": "The Han dynasty (UK: /\u02c8h\u00e6n/, US: /\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0n/;[4][5] traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u671d; simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u671d; pinyin: H\u00e0nch\u00e1o) was an imperial dynasty of China (202 BC \u2013 9 AD, 25\u2013220 AD), established by Liu Bang and ruled by the House of Liu.The dynasty was preceded by the short-lived Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 BC) and a warring interregnum known as the Chu\u2013Han contention (206\u2013202 BC), and it was succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280 AD).The dynasty was briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9\u201323 AD) established by usurping regent Wang Mang, and is thus separated into two periods\u2014the Western Han (202 BC \u2013 9 AD) and the Eastern Han (25\u2013220AD).Spanning over four centuries, the Han dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history, and it has influenced the identity of the Chinese civilization ever since.[6] Modern China's majority ethnic group refer to themselves as the \"Han people\" or \"Han Chinese\".The spoken Sinitic language and written Chinese are referred to respectively as the \"Han language\" and \"Han characters\".[7].The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society.He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class.The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government called commanderies, as well as a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms.These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States.From the reign of Emperor Wu (r.\u2009141\u201387 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu.This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912..The Han dynasty saw an age of economic prosperity and witnessed a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty (c.\u20091050\u2013256 BC).", "Tourette syndrome": "Tourette syndrome or Tourette's syndrome (abbreviated as TS or Tourette's) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in childhood or adolescence.It is characterized by multiple movement (motor) tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic.Common tics are blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements.These are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles known as a premonitory urge, can sometimes be suppressed temporarily, and characteristically change in location, strength, and frequency.Tourette's is at the more severe end of a spectrum of tic disorders.The tics often go unnoticed by casual observers..Tourette's was once regarded as a rare and bizarre syndrome and has popularly been associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks).It is no longer considered rare; about 1% of school-age children and adolescents are estimated to have Tourette's,[2] though coprolalia occurs only in a minority.There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; it is not always correctly identified, because most cases are mild, and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence.Therefore, many go undiagnosed or may never seek medical attention.Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is rare, but for a small minority, severely debilitating tics can persist into adulthood.Tourette's does not affect intelligence or life expectancy..", "Sunbeam (car company)": "Sunbeam Motor Car Company Limited was a British automobile manufacturer in operation between 1905 and 1934.Its works were at Moorfields in Blakenhall, a suburb of Wolverhampton in Staffordshire, now West Midlands.The Sunbeam name had originally been registered by John Marston in 1888 for his bicycle manufacturing business.Sunbeam motor car manufacture began in 1901.The motor business was sold to a newly incorporated Sunbeam Motor Car Company Limited in 1905 to separate it from Marston's pedal bicycle business; Sunbeam motorcycles were not made until 1912..In-house designer Louis Coatalen had an enthusiasm for motor racing accumulated expertise with engines.Sunbeam manufactured their own aero engines during the First World War and 647aircraft to the designs of other manufacturers.Engines drew Sunbeam into Grand Prix racing and participation in the achievement of world land speed records..In spite of its well-regarded cars and aero engines, by 1934 a long period of particularly slow sales had brought continuing losses.Sunbeam was unable to repay money borrowed for ten years in 1924 to fund its Grand Prix racing programme, and a receiver was appointed.There was a forced sale, and Sunbeam was picked up by the Rootes brothers.Manufacture of Sunbeam's then old-fashioned cars did not resume under the new owners, but Sunbeam trolleybuses remained in production..", "Fox News Channel": "The Fox News Channel (FNC), commonly known as Fox News, is an American multinational conservative news and political commentary television channel and website based in New York City.[3][4] It is owned by Fox News Media, which itself is owned by the Fox Corporation.[5] It is the most-watched cable network in the U.S.,[6][7][8] and as of 2023 generates approximately 70% of its parent company's pre-tax profit.[9]  The channel broadcasts primarily from studios at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan.Fox News provides a service to 86 countries and territories,[10] with international broadcasts featuring Fox Extra segments during advertising breaks.[11].The channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch in 1996 to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former Republican media consultant and CNBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO.[12][13] It launched on October 7, 1996, to 17 million cable subscribers.[14] Fox News grew during the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant United States cable news subscription network.[15]  By September 2018, 87 million U.S.households (91 percent of television subscribers) could receive Fox News.[16] In 2019, it was the top-rated cable network, averaging 2.5million viewers in prime time.[17][18][19] Murdoch, the executive chairman since 2016,[20][21] said in 2023 that he would step down and hand responsibilities to his son, Lachlan.[22] Suzanne Scott has been the CEO since 2018.[23].Fox News controversies have included biased reporting in favor of the Republican Party, its politicians, and conservative causes,[24][25][26] while portraying the Democratic Party in a negative light.[27][28] Critics have argued that the channel is damaging to the integrity of news overall.[29][30] In 2009, Fox News denied bias in its news reporting.The channel's official position was that its reporting operates independently of its opinion journalism.[31][needs update].After Dominion Voting Systems initiated a defamation lawsuit against Fox regarding their reporting on the 2020 U.S.election, Fox's internal communications were released, showing that its presenters and senior executives privately doubted claims of a stolen election, while Fox continued to broadcast such claims.[32] Other communications showed Fox CEO Suzanne Scott stating that fact-checking such claims would alienate Fox viewers.[33] Fox settled the lawsuit in 2023 by agreeing to pay Dominion $787.5 million and acknowledging the court ruling that Fox spread falsehoods about Dominion.[34][35].According to Pew Research Center, in 2019, 65 percent of Republicans and people who lean Republican trusted Fox News.[36].In May 1985, Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch announced that he and American industrialist and philanthropist Marvin Davis intended to develop \"a network of independent stations as a fourth marketing force\" to compete directly with CBS, NBC, and ABC through the purchase of six television stations owned by Metromedia.[37] In July 1985, 20th Century Fox announced Murdoch had completed his purchase of 50% of Fox Filmed Entertainment, the parent company of 20th Century Fox Film Corporation.[38].Subsequently, and prior to founding FNC, Murdoch had gained experience in the 24-hour news business when News Corporation's BSkyB subsidiary began Europe's first 24-hour news channel (Sky News) in the United Kingdom in 1989.[39] With the success of his efforts establishing Fox as a TV network in the United States,[40][41] experience gained from Sky News and the turnaround of 20th Century Fox, Murdoch announced on January 30, 1996, that News Corp.would launch a 24-hour news channel on cable and satellite systems in the United States as part of a News Corp.", "Mandibular first molar": "The mandibular first molar or six-year molar is the tooth located distally (away from the midline of the face) from both the mandibular second premolars of the mouth but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular second molars.It is located on the mandibular (lower) arch of the mouth, and generally opposes the maxillary (upper) first molars and the maxillary 2nd premolar in normal class I occlusion.The function of this molar is similar to that of all molars in regard to grinding being the principal action during mastication, commonly known as chewing.There are usually five well-developed cusps on mandibular first molars: two on the buccal (side nearest the cheek), two lingual (side nearest the tongue), and one distal.The shape of the developmental and supplementary grooves, on the occlusal surface, are described as being 'M' shaped.There are great differences between the deciduous (baby) mandibular molars and those of the permanent mandibular molars, even though their function are similar.The permanent mandibular molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede it.Despite being named molars, the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars..In the universal system of notation, the deciduous mandibular first molars are designated by a letter written in uppercase.The right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as \"S\", and the left one is known as \"L\".The international notation has a different system of notation.Thus, the right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as \"84\", and the left one is known as \"74\"..", "Florida Legislature": "The Florida Legislature is the legislature of the U.S.State of Florida.It is organized as a bicameral body composed of an upper chamber, the Senate, and a lower chamber, the House of Representatives.Article III, Section 1 of the Florida Constitution, adopted in 1968, defines the role of the legislature and how it is to be constituted.[2] The legislature is composed of 160 state legislators (120 in the House and 40 in the Senate).The primary purpose of the legislature is to enact new laws and amend or repeal existing laws.It meets in the Florida State Capitol building in Tallahassee.[3].Members of the Senate are referred to as senators and members of the House of Representatives are referred to as representatives.Because this shadows the terminology used to describe members of the U.S.Congress, constituents and the news media, using  The Associated Press Stylebook, often refer to legislators as state senators or state representatives to avoid confusion with their federal counterparts..The Senate is the upper house of the state legislature.It consists of 40 members elected from single-member districts.Senators are elected on a partisan basis, typically to four-year staggered terms, with half of the Senate elected every two years.", "Daniel 2": "Daniel 2 (the second chapter of the Book of Daniel) tells how Daniel related and interpreted a dream of Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon.In his night dream, the king saw a gigantic statue made of four metals, from its head of gold to its feet of mingled iron and clay; as he watched, a stone \"not cut by human hands\" destroyed the statue and became a mountain filling the whole world.Daniel explained to the king that the statue represented four successive kingdoms beginning with Babylon, while the stone and mountain signified a kingdom established by God which would never be destroyed nor given to another people.Nebuchadnezzar then acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel's God and raises him to high office in Babylon.[1].The book of which Daniel is the hero divides into two parts, a set of tales in chapters 1\u20136, and the series of visions in chapters 7\u201312,[2] the tales no earlier than the Hellenistic period (323\u201330 BCE), and the visions from the Maccabean era (the mid-2nd century BCE).[3] Chapter 2 in its present form dates from no earlier than the first decades of the Seleucid Empire (312\u201363 BCE), but its roots may reach back to the Fall of Babylon (539 BCE) and the rise of the Persian Achaemenid Empire (c.550\u2013330 BCE).[4].The overall theme of the Book of Daniel is God's sovereignty over history.[5] On the human level Daniel is set against the Babylonian magicians who fail to interpret the king's dream, but the cosmic conflict is between the God of Israel and the false Babylonian gods.[6] What counts is not Daniel's human gifts, nor his education in the arts of divination, but \"Divine Wisdom\" and the power that belongs to God alone, as Daniel indicates when he urges his companions to seek God's mercy for the interpretation of the king's dreams.[7].In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, is troubled by a dream.He summons his magicians and astrologers to interpret it, but demands that they first tell him what the dream was.They protest that no man can do such a thing, and Nebuchadnezzar orders that they all be executed.This decree also falls on Daniel, but he, through the agency of his God, is able to tell the king the dream.It was a dream of a great statue with a head of gold, arms and chest of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mingled iron and clay.", "Comcast": "Comcast Corporation (formerly known as American Cable Systems and Comcast Holdings, stylized in all caps),[note 1] incorporated and headquartered in Philadelphia, is the largest American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate.[8] The corporation is the second-largest broadcasting and cable television company in the world by revenue (behind AT&T), and is also the largest pay-TV company, the largest cable TV company, and largest home Internet service provider in the United States.Comcast is additionally the nation's third-largest home telephone service provider.It provides services to U.S.residential and commercial customers in 40 states and the District of Columbia.[9] As the owner of the international media company NBCUniversal since 2011, Comcast is also a high-volume producer of feature films for theatrical exhibition and television programming, and a theme park operator..Comcast owns and operates the Xfinity residential cable communications business segment and division; Comcast Business, a commercial services provider; and Xfinity Mobile, an MVNO of Verizon.Through NBCUniversal, it also owns and operates over-the-air national broadcast network channels such as NBC, Telemundo, TeleXitos, and Cozi TV; multiple cable-only channels such as MSNBC, CNBC, USA Network, Syfy, Oxygen, Bravo, and E!; the film studio Universal Pictures; the VOD streaming service Peacock; animation studios DreamWorks Animation, Illumination, and Universal Animation Studios; and Universal Destinations & Experiences.It also has significant holdings in digital distribution, such as thePlatform, which it acquired in 2006; and ad-tech company FreeWheel, which it acquired in 2014.Since October 2018, it has also been the parent company of Sky Group.[10].Comcast has been criticized and put under intense public scrutiny for a variety of reasons.Its customer satisfaction ratings were among the lowest in the cable industry during the years 2008\u20132010.[11][12] It has violated net neutrality practices in the past, and, despite its commitment to a narrow definition of net neutrality,[13] critics advocate a definition that precludes any distinction between Comcast's private network services and the rest of the Internet.[14] Critics also point out a lack of competition in the vast majority of Comcast's service areas; in particular, the limited competition among cable providers.[15] Given its negotiating power as a large ISP, some suspect that it could leverage paid peering agreements to unfairly influence end-user connection speeds.Its ownership of both content production (in NBCUniversal) and distribution (as an ISP) has raised antitrust concerns.These issues and others led to Comcast being dubbed \"The Worst Company in America\" by The Consumerist in 2010 and 2014.[16][17].", "Porcupine": "Porcupines are large rodents with coats of sharp spines, or quills, that protect them against predation.The term covers two families of animals: the Old World porcupines of the family Hystricidae, and the New World porcupines of the family  Erethizontidae.[1][2] Both families belong to the infraorder Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of rigid or semi-rigid quills, which are modified hairs composed of keratin.Despite this, the two groups are distinct from one another and are not closely related to each other within the Hystricognathi.The largest species of porcupine is the third-largest living rodent in the world, after the capybara and beaver..The Old World porcupines (Hystricidae) live in Italy, Asia (western[3] and southern), and most of Africa.They are large, terrestrial, and strictly nocturnal..The New World porcupines (Erethizontidae) are indigenous to North America and northern South America.They live in wooded areas and can climb trees, where some species spend their entire lives.They are less strictly nocturnal than their Old World counterparts and generally smaller..Most porcupines are about 60\u201390cm (25\u201336in) long, with a 20\u201325cm (8\u201310in) long tail.Weighing 5\u201316kg (12\u201335lb), they are rounded, large, and slow, and use an aposematic strategy of defence.Porcupines' colouration consists of various shades of brown, grey and white.", "Elijah McCoy": "Elijah J.McCoy (May 2, 1844\u200a[A] \u2013 October 10, 1929) was a Canadian-American engineer of African-American descent who invented lubrication systems for steam engines.Born free on the Ontario shore of Lake Erie to parents who fled enslavement in Kentucky, he traveled to the United States as a young child when his family returned in 1847, becoming a U.S.resident and citizen.His inventions and accomplishments were honored in 2012 when the United States Patent and Trademark Office named its first regional office, in Detroit, Michigan, the \"Elijah J.McCoy Midwest Regional Patent Office\".[3].Elijah McCoy was born in 1844 in Colchester, Ontario, to George and Mildred Goins McCoy.At the time, they were fugitive slaves who had escaped from Kentucky to Ontario via helpers through the Underground Railroad.[4] George and Mildred arrived in Colchester Township, Essex County, in what was then called Upper Canada in 1837 via Detroit.Elijah McCoy had eleven siblings.Ten of the children were born in Ontario from Alfred (1836) to William (1859)..Upper Canadian schools were segregated under the Common Schools Act as amended in 1850,[5][6] and McCoy was educated in black schools of Colchester Township.At the age of 15, in 1859, Elijah McCoy was sent to Scotland.", "Hydrogen vehicle": "A hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen fuel for motive power.Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen-fueled space rockets, as well as ships and aircraft.Motive power is generated by converting the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy, either by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to power electric motors or, less commonly, by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine.[4].As of 2021[update], there are two models of hydrogen cars publicly available in select markets: the Toyota Mirai (2014\u2013), which is the world's first commercially produced dedicated fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV),[1][2][5] and the Hyundai Nexo (2018\u2013).There are also fuel cell buses.Hydrogen aircraft are not expected to carry many passengers long haul before the 2030s at the earliest.[6][7].As of 2019, 98% of hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming, which emits carbon dioxide.[8] It can be produced by electrolysis of water, or by thermochemical or pyrolytic means using renewable feedstocks, but the processes are currently expensive.[9] Various technologies are being developed that aim to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with hydrogen production using natural gas.[10].Vehicles running on hydrogen technology benefit from a long range on a single refuelling, but are subject to several drawbacks: high carbon emissions when hydrogen is produced from natural gas, capital cost burden, high energy inputs in production, low energy content per unit volume at ambient conditions, production and compression of hydrogen, the investment required to build refuelling infrastructure around the world to dispense hydrogen, and transportation of hydrogen.[11][12][13] In addition, leaked hydrogen has a global warming effect 11.6 times stronger than CO\u2082.[14].For light duty vehicles including passenger cars, hydrogen adoption is behind that of battery electric vehicles.A2022 study found that technological developments and economies of scale in BEVs, compared with the evolution of the use of hydrogen, have made it unlikely for hydrogen light-duty vehicles to play a significant role in the future.[15].The rationale for hydrogen vehicles lies in their potential to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, associated greenhouse gas emissions and localised air pollution from transportation.[18] This would require hydrogen to be produced cleanly, for use in sectors and applications where cheaper and more energy efficient mitigation alternatives are limited..Companies such as Boeing, Lange Aviation, and the German Aerospace Center pursue hydrogen as fuel for crewed and uncrewed aeroplanes.", "Sacramento, California": "Sacramento (Spanish for 'sacrament') (/\u02ccs\u00e6kr\u0259\u02c8m\u025bnto\u028a/ SAK-r\u0259-MEN-toh; Spanish: [sak\u027ea\u02c8mento]) is the capital city of the U.S.state of California and the county seat of Sacramento County.Located at the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers in Northern California's Sacramento Valley, Sacramento's 2020 population of 524,943[7] makes it the fourth-most populous city in Northern California, sixth-most populous city in the state, and the ninth-most populous state capital in the United States.[9][10] Sacramento is the seat of the California Legislature and the Governor of California..Sacramento is also the cultural and economic core of the Greater Sacramento area, which at the 2020 census had a population of 2,680,831,[8] the fourth-largest metropolitan area in California.[11].Before the arrival of the Spanish, the area was inhabited by the Nisenan, Maidu, and other indigenous peoples of California.Spanish cavalryman Gabriel Moraga surveyed and named the R\u00edo del Sant\u00edsimo Sacramento (Sacramento River) in 1808, after the Blessed Sacrament.In 1839, Juan Bautista Alvarado, Mexican governor of Alta California, granted the responsibility of colonizing the Sacramento Valley to Swiss-born Mexican citizen John Augustus Sutter, who subsequently established Sutter's Fort and the settlement at the Rancho Nueva Helvetia.Following the American Conquest of California and the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the waterfront developed by Sutter began to be developed and incorporated in 1850 as the City of Sacramento.In 1852, the city offered its county courthouse to the state of California to house the state legislature, resulting in the city becoming the permanent state capital in 1854 and ushering in the construction of a new state capitol building which was finished in 1874.[12].Sacramento is the fastest-growing major city in California,[13] owing to its status as a notable political center on the West Coast and as a major educational hub, home of California State University, Sacramento and UC Davis.Similarly, Sacramento is a major center for the California healthcare industry, as the seat of Sutter Health, the world-renowned UC Davis Medical Center, and the UC Davis School of Medicine.In 2013, the Sacramento Convention and Visitors Bureau stated that the city receives 15.3 million visitors per year,[14] and is home to the California Museum, Crocker Art Museum, California State Railroad Museum, California State Capitol Museum, California Hall of Fame, and Old Sacramento State Historic Park.", "Apple Store": "The Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc.The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories..The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000.Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001.The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 527 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in Wenzhou, China on November 4, 2023.[1][2] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16billion globally in 2011..In May 2016, Angela Ahrendts, Apple's then-Senior Vice President of retail, unveiled a significantly redesigned Apple Store in Union Square, San Francisco, featuring large glass doors for the entry, open spaces, and rebranded rooms.In addition to purchasing products, consumers can get advice and help from \"Creative Pros\" \u2013 individuals with specialized knowledge of creative arts; get product support in a tree-lined Genius Grove; and attend sessions, conferences, and community events, with Ahrendts commenting that the goal is to make Apple Stores into \"town squares\", a place where people naturally meet up and spend time.The new design will be applied to all Apple Stores worldwide, a process that has seen stores temporarily relocate or close..Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone flagship stores in high-profile locations.It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes.", "Steve jobs": "Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 \u2013 October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, inventor, and investor best known as the co-founder of Apple.Jobs was also chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, and the founder of NeXT.He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak..Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother.He was adopted shortly after his birth.He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year.In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism.He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI).This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI.The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics..", "Roman numerals": "Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages.Numbers are written with combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet, each letter with a fixed integer value.Modern style uses only these seven:.The use of Roman numerals continued long after the decline of the Roman Empire.From the 14th century on, Roman numerals began to be replaced by Arabic numerals; however, this process was gradual, and the use of Roman numerals persists in some applications to this day..One place they are often seen is on clock faces.For instance, on the clock of Big Ben (designed in 1852), the hours from 1 to 12 are written as:.The notations IV and IX can be read as \"one less than five\" (4) and \"one less than ten\" (9), although there is a tradition favouring representation of \"4\" as \"IIII\" on Roman numeral clocks.[1].Other common uses include year numbers on monuments and buildings and copyright dates on the title screens of movies and television programs.MCM, signifying \"a thousand, and a hundred less than another thousand\", means 1900, so 1912 is written MCMXII.For the years of the current (21st) century, MM indicates 2000.The current year is MMXXIII (2023)..", "Effective nuclear charge": "In atomic physics, the effective nuclear charge is the actual amount of positive (nuclear) charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom.The term \"effective\" is used because the shielding effect of negatively charged electrons prevent higher energy electrons from experiencing the full nuclear charge of the nucleus due to the repelling effect of inner layer.The effective nuclear charge experienced by an electron is also called the core charge.It is possible to determine the strength of the nuclear charge by the oxidation number of the atom.Most of the physical and chemical properties of the elements can be explained on the basis of electronic configuration.Consider the behavior of ionization energies in the periodic table.It is known that the magnitude of ionization potential depends upon the following factors:.In the periodic table, effective nuclear charge decreases down a group and increases left to right across a period..The effective atomic number Zeff, (sometimes referred to as the effective nuclear charge) of an atom is the number of protons that an electron in the element effectively 'sees' due to screening by inner-shell electrons.It is a measure of the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons in the atom.One can view the electrons in an atom as being 'stacked' by energy outside the nucleus; the lowest energy electrons (such as the 1s and 2s electrons) occupy the space closest to the nucleus, and electrons of higher energy are located further from the nucleus..The binding energy of an electron, or the energy needed to remove the electron from the atom, is a function of the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nucleus.", "List of Storm Chasers episodes": "This is a list of episodes from the Discovery Channel series, Storm Chasers..During the 2007 season, which consisted of 4 episodes, Josh Wurman and Sean Casey's team used a fleet of three vehicles: the Tornado Intercept Vehicle (or TIV), the Scout (a modified 1993 Nissan Pathfinder), and a Doppler on Wheels (or DOW).Team members for the 2007 season included Herb Stein (DOW driver), Mara McFalls (scout driver/journalist), Justin Walker (scout navigator/meteorologist), Danny Cheresnick (DOW navigator/meteorologist), and Karen Kosiba (DOW navigator/meteorologist)..For the 2008 season, which consisted of eight episodes, Wurman and Casey's team and its vehicles were expanded and upgraded as follows: 1) the DOW 3 was replaced by the new DOW 6 (based around an International 7500 truck) with improved speed, power and range; 2) the original TIV was augmented by the new TIV 2 (both versions are still used in the field); and 3) two new vehicles, PROBE 1 and PROBE 2 (modified Dodge Ram 1500s), were used to deploy probes.Justin Walker (navigator-meteorologist), and his wife Hannah (driver) rode in PROBE 1, while Danny Cheresnick (navigator) and Aaron Rupert (driver) manned the original Scout vehicle.Beginning this season, the series also followed Reed Timmer and the crew from the website TornadoVideos.net (TVN).The TVN vehicle is a 2008 Chevrolet Tahoe[1].Due to popular demand, the Storm Chasers series was aired in the UK starting on February 17, 2009.The Science of Storm Chasing series never came to the UK..On May 18, 2009, Discovery Channel renewed Storm Chasers for a third season, which began airing in the Fall of 2009.Reed Timmer and the TVN team return with their new \"SRV Dominator\" vehicle.Dr.", "Interstate Highway System": "The Dwight D.Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, commonly known as the Interstate Highway System, the Eisenhower Interstate System, or simply the Interstate, is a network of controlled-access highways that forms part of the National Highway System in the United States.The system extends throughout the contiguous United States and has routes in Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico..In the 20th century, the United States Congress began funding roadways through the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916, and started an effort to construct a national road grid with the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921.In 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was established, creating the first national road numbering system for cross-country travel.The roads were state-funded and maintained, and there were few national standards for road design.United States Numbered Highways ranged from two-lane country roads to multi-lane freeways.After Dwight D.Eisenhower became president in 1953, his administration developed a proposal for an interstate highway system, eventually resulting in the enactment of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956..Unlike the earlier United States Numbered Highway System, the Interstates were designed to be an all-freeway system, with nationally unified standards for construction and signage.While some older freeways were adopted into the system, most of the routes were completely new construction, greatly expanding the freeway network in the United States.Particularly in densely populated urban areas, these new freeways were often controversial as their building necessitated the destruction of many older, well-established neighborhoods; as a result of the many freeway revolts during the 1960s and 1970s, several planned Interstates were abandoned or re-routed to avoid urban cores..", ".eu": ".eu is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU).[2] Launched on 7 December 2005, the domain is available for any person, company or organization based in the European Union.This was extended to the European Economic Area in 2014, after the regulation was incorporated into the EEA Agreement, and hence is also available for any person, company or organization based in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.[3][4] The TLD is administered by EURid, a consortium originally consisting of the national ccTLD registry operators of Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, joined later by the national registry operator of the Czech Republic.Trademark owners were able to submit registrations through a sunrise period, in an effort to prevent cybersquatting.Full registration started on 7 April 2006.[5].The .eu ccTLD was approved by ICANN on 22 March 2005[6] and put in the Internet root zone on 2 May 2005.[7] Even though the EU is not a country (it is a sui generis intergovernmental and supranational organisation), it has an exceptional reservation in ISO 3166.The Commission and ICANN had extended negotiations lasting more than five years to secure its acceptance.[8]..eu.int was the subdomain most used by the European Commission and the European Parliament, based on the .int generic top-level domain (gTLD) for international bodies, until 9 May 2006.The .eu domain (ccTLD) was launched in December 2005, and because of this most .eu.int domain names changed to .europa.eu on Europe day, 9 May 2006..The sunrise period was broken into two phases.The first phase, which began on 7 December 2005 was to facilitate applications by registrants with prior rights based on trademarks and geographic names.The second phase began on 7 February 2006 and covered company, trade and personal names.In the case of all Sunrise applications, the application needed to be accompanied by documents proving the claim to ownership of a certain right.", "Meister": "Meister (German: [\u02c8ma\u026a\u032fst\u0250] \u24d8) means 'master' in German (as in master craftsman, or as an honorific title such as Meister Eckhart).The word is akin to master and maestro.In sports, Meister is used for the current national, European or world champion (e.g.Deutscher Meister, Europameister, Weltmeister)..Meister, in compositions such as Polizeimeister or Wachtmeister, has a tradition in the ranks of various German police forces, partially also in Switzerland.During the Second World War, Meister was the highest enlisted rank of the German Ordnungspolizei.In professional life, Meister usually refers to a higher degree in vocational education..Meister has been borrowed into English slang, where it is used in compound nouns.A person referred to as \u201cMeister\u201d is one who has extensive theoretical knowledge and practical skills in his profession, business, or some other kind of work or activity.For example, a \u201cpuzzle-meister\u201d would be someone highly skilled at solving puzzles.These neologisms sometimes have a sarcastic intent (for example, \u201cstubble-meister\u201d for someone with a short, neat beard, or \u201ccrier-meister\u201d for someone who often cries)..In Germany and Austria, the word Meister also assigns a title and public degree in the field of vocational education.", "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers": "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (MMPR) is an American superhero television series that premiered on August 28, 1993, on the Fox Kids programming block.It is the first entry of the Power Rangers franchise, and became a 1990s pop culture phenomenon along with a large line of toys, action figures, and other merchandise.[1] The show adapted stock footage from the Japanese TV series Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger (1992\u20131993), which was the 16th installment of Toei's Super Sentai franchise.[2] The second and third seasons of the show drew elements and stock footage from Gosei Sentai Dairanger and Ninja Sentai Kakuranger, respectively, though the Zyuranger costumes were still used for the lead cast in these two seasons.Only the mecha and the Kiba Ranger (White Ranger) costume from Dairanger were featured in the second season while only the Kakuranger mecha was featured in the third season, though the Kakuranger costumes were later used for the mini-series Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers.The series was produced by MMPR Productions and distributed by Saban Entertainment, while the show's merchandise was produced and distributed by Bandai Entertainment..While a global storyline would continue in Power Rangers Zeo, Power Rangers Turbo, Power Rangers in Space, and Power Rangers Lost Galaxy (which could be considered respectively and unofficially as the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons of the original series), the subsequent series would not be sequels or spin-offs in the traditional sense, having self-contained plots with no strong connection with the original series (except taking place in the same universe, not being reboots).The exceptions would be Power Rangers Dino Thunder, which could be considered as a continuation of the original classic series by having the presence of the character Tommy Oliver (the Green Ranger and later White Ranger, portrayed by Jason David Frank) as part of the regular team of Rangers of the generation of that series (in some of the other series the character only made special participations).Another series connected to the original classic series would be Power Rangers Operation Overdrive, as one of the main villains of this series, Thrax, is the son of Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, main villains of the classic series..In 2010, a remake of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, with a revised new look of the original 1993 logo, comic book-referenced graphics, and extra alternative visual effects, was broadcast on ABC Kids, and Bandai produced brand new toys to coincide with the series.Only the first 32 of season one's 60 episodes were remade.It was the final Power Rangers season to air on ABC Kids as Haim Saban re-acquired the franchise from Disney, who took over the rights in 2002.With the beginning of Power Rangers Samurai in 2011, the franchise had moved to Nickelodeon.[3][4].The original series also spawned the feature film Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, released by 20th Century Fox on June 30, 1995.", "Edgar allan poe": "Edgar Allan Poe (n\u00e9Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 \u2013 October 7, 1849) was an American writer, poet, author, editor, and literary critic who is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre.He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism and Gothic fiction in the United States, and of American literature.[1] Poe was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story, and is considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre, as well as a significant contributor to the emerging genre of science fiction.[2] He is the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.[3].Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Poe.[4] His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when his mother died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia.They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood.He attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money.He quarreled with John Allan over the funds for his education, and his gambling debts.In 1827, having enlisted in the United States Army under an assumed name, he published his first collection, Tamerlane and Other Poems, credited only to \"a Bostonian\".Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife in 1829.Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declared a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and parted ways with Allan..Poe switched his focus to prose, and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism.His work forced him to move between several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City.In 1836, he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm, but she died of tuberculosis in 1847.", "Carnivore": "A carnivore /\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0rn\u026av\u0254\u02d0r/, or meat-eater (Latin, caro, genitive carnis, meaning meat or \"flesh\" and vorare meaning \"to devour\"), is an animal or plant whose food and energy requirements derive from animal tissues (mainly muscle, fat and other soft tissues) whether through hunting or scavenging.[1][2].The technical term for mammals in the order Carnivora is carnivoran, and they are so-named because most member species in the group have a carnivorous diet, but the similarity of the name of the order and the name of the diet causes confusion..Many but not all carnivorans are meat eaters; a few, such as the large and small cats (felidae) are obligate carnivores (see below).Other classes of carnivore are highly variable.The Ursids, for example: While the Arctic polar bear eats meat almost exclusively (more than 90% of its diet is meat), almost all other bear species are omnivorous, and one species, the giant panda, is nearly exclusively herbivorous.[3].Dietary carnivory is not a distinguishing trait of the order: Many mammals with highly carnivorous diets are not members of the order Carnivora.Cetaceans, for example, all eat other animals, but are paradoxically members of the almost exclusively plant-eating hooved mammals..Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called hypercarnivores or obligate carnivores, while those that also consume non-animal food are called mesocarnivores, or facultative carnivores, or omnivores (there are no clear distinctions).[2] A carnivore at the top of the food chain (adults not preyed upon by other animals) is termed an apex predator, regardless of whether it is an obligate or facultative carnivore..Outside the animal kingdom, there are several genera containing carnivorous plants (predominantly insectivores) and several phyla containing carnivorous fungi (preying mostly on microscopic invertebrates, such as nematodes, amoebae, and springtails)..Carnivores are sometimes characterized by their type of prey.For example, animals that eat mainly insects and similar invertebrates are called insectivores, while those that eat mainly fish are called piscivores..Carnivores may alternatively be classified according to the percentage of meat in their diet.", "FIFA World Cup": "The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition between the senior men's national teams of the members of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body.The tournament has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, with the exception of 1942 and 1946 due to the Second World War.The reigning champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022 tournament..The contest starts with the qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase.In the tournament phase, 32 teams compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over the course of about a month.The host nation(s) automatically qualify for the group stage of the tournament.The next FIFA World Cup is scheduled to expand to 48 teams for the 2026 tournament..As of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 22 final tournaments have been held since the event's inception in 1930, and a total of 80 national teams have competed.The trophy has been won by eight national teams.Brazil, with five wins, are the only team to have played in every tournament.The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, with three titles; France and inaugural winner Uruguay, each with two titles; and England and Spain, with one title each..The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world.[1][2] The viewership of the 2018 World Cup was estimated to be 3.57billion, close to half of the global population,[3][4] while the engagement with the 2022 World Cup was estimated to be 5billion, with about 1.5billion people watching the final match.[5].", "Heroes (TV series)": "Heroes is an American superhero drama television series created by Tim Kring that aired on NBC for four seasons from September 25, 2006, to February 8, 2010.The series tells the stories of ordinary people who discover that they have superhuman abilities and how these abilities take effect in the characters' lives as they work together to prevent catastrophic futures.The series emulates the aesthetic style and storytelling of American comic books, using multi-episode story arcs that build upon a larger, more encompassing narrative.[1] It was produced by Tailwind Productions in association with Universal Media Studios.[2] It was filmed primarily in Los Angeles, California.[3].Four complete seasons aired, ending on February 8, 2010.[4] The critically acclaimed first season had a run of 23 episodes and garnered an average of 14.3 million viewers in the United States, receiving the highest rating for an NBC drama premiere in five years.[5] The second season of Heroes attracted an average of 13.1 million viewers in the U.S.[6] and marked NBC's sole series among the top 20 ranked programs in total viewership for the 2007\u20132008 season.[7] Heroes earned a number of awards and nominations, including Primetime Emmy Awards, Golden Globes, People's Choice Awards, and British Academy Television Awards.[2].An online extension of the series, Heroes 360 Experience (later rebranded as Heroes Evolutions), was created to explore the Heroes universe and provides insight into the show's mythology.[8] Other official Heroes media include magazines, action figures, tie-in and interactive websites, a mobile game, a novel, clothing and other merchandise.In the fall of 2008, NBC Digital Entertainment released a series of online content for the summer, including more original web content, wireless iTV interactivity, graphic novels available for mobile viewing and webisodes.[9].A 13-episode follow-up miniseries, Heroes Reborn, premiered on NBC on September 24, 2015.[10][11].Originally, Kring designed the series to have an ever-shifting cast.However, his motivation changed when he realized how popular the original cast was with audiences; therefore, he brought back most of the first-season cast for the second season, with a few additions who received star billing.[12] In its first season, the show features an ensemble cast of twelve main characters making it the third largest cast in American primetime television behind Desperate Housewives and Lost.Although NBC's first-season cast page listed only ten characters,[13] Leonard Roberts, who first appeared in the series' fifth episode as D L Hawkins, was an additional member of the original full-time cast.In the first-season episode \"Fallout\", Jack Coleman, who portrays Noah Bennet, was upgraded from a recurring role to become the twelfth full-time cast member.[14].The following remained major characters during all four seasons:.", "J. P. Morgan": "John Pierpont Morgan (April 17, 1837\u2013 March 31, 1913)[1] was an American financier and investment banker who dominated corporate finance on Wall Street throughout the Gilded Age.As the head of the banking firm that ultimately became known as J.P.Morgan and Co., he was the driving force behind the wave of industrial consolidation in the United States spanning the late 19th and early 20th centuries..Over the course of his career on Wall Street, Morgan spearheaded the formation of several prominent multinational corporations including U.S.Steel, International Harvester, and General Electric.He and his partners also held controlling interests in numerous other American businesses including Aetna, Western Union, Pullman Car Company, and 21 railroads.[2] Due to the extent of his dominance over U.S.finance, Morgan exercised enormous influence over the nation's policies and the market forces underlying its economy.During the Panic of 1907, he organized a coalition of financiers that saved the American monetary system from collapse..As the Progressive Era's leading financier, Morgan's dedication to efficiency and modernization helped transform the shape of the American economy.[1] Adrian Wooldridge characterized Morgan as America's \"greatest banker\".[3] Morgan died in Rome, Italy, in his sleep in 1913 at the age of 75, leaving his fortune and business to his son, John Pierpont Morgan Jr.Biographer Ron Chernow estimated his fortune at $80million (equivalent to $2.4billion in 2022).[4].Morgan was born on April 17, 1837, in Hartford, Connecticut, to Junius Spencer Morgan (1813\u20131890) and Juliet Pierpont (1816\u20131884) of the influential Morgan family.His father, Junius, was a partner at Howe Mather & Co., the largest dry goods wholesaler in Hartford.", "List of Mnemosyne episodes": "Mnemosyne (\u30e0\u30cd\u30e2\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u306e\u5a18\u305f\u3061, Munemoshune no Musumetachi), also known as RIN: Daughters of Mnemosyne, is a six-episode Japanese anime television series produced by Xebec and Genco.[2] The anime was produced to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the AT-X network, which it originally aired on.[3] Funimation licensed the series in North America.The plot, rich in the mix of murder and action, is set in modern and near-future Tokyo, and revolves around Rin Asougi, an immortal private investigator.A light novel and a manga adaptation have also been published..A mysterious tree known as Yggdrasil would often appear in the world of the humans, releasing many small orbs into the human world.A small proportion of the orbs are special ones known as \"Time Fruits\".If a Time Fruit enters a female, she becomes Immortal.If a Time Fruit enters a male, he becomes a crazed winged being known as an \"Angel\".Rin Asougi is an immortal who runs a private investigation agency in Tokyo's Shinjuku district alongside her assistant, Mimi who is also immortal.Rin often converses with a mysterious unknown individual on the phone.She is often being hunted down by an assassin named Laura who was hired by Apos, an angel who persecutes immortals and is the current guardian of the Yggdrasil..The story begins in the year 1990.During a search for a missing cat, Rin instead finds Koki Maeno, a young man with distorted memories.", "Digital forensics": "Digital forensics (sometimes known as digital forensic science) is a branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery, investigation, examination, and analysis of material found in digital devices, often in relation to mobile devices and computer crime.[1][2] The term \"digital forensics\" was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data.[1] With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged..Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications.The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts.Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as murder, theft, and assault against the person.Civil cases, on the other hand, deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes), but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (ediscovery) may be involved..Forensics may also feature in the private sector, such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigations (a special probe into the nature and extent of an unauthorized network intrusion)..The technical aspect of an investigation is divided into several sub-branches related to the type of digital devices involved: computer forensics, network forensics, forensic data analysis, and mobile device forensics.[3] The typical forensic process encompasses the seizure, forensic imaging (acquisition), and analysis of digital media, followed with the production of a report of the collected evidence..As well as identifying direct evidence of a crime, digital forensics can be used to attribute evidence to specific suspects, confirm alibis or statements, determine intent, identify sources (for example, in copyright cases), or authenticate documents.[4] Investigations are much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis (where the usual aim is to provide answers to a series of simpler questions), often involving complex time-lines or hypotheses.[5].Prior to the 1970s, crimes involving computers were dealt with using existing laws.The first computer crimes were recognized in the 1978 Florida Computer Crimes Act,[6] which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion of data on a computer system.[7] Over the next few years, the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright, privacy/harassment (e.g., cyber bullying, happy slapping, cyber stalking, and online predators), and child pornography.[8][9] It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences.Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983.[7] This was followed by the US Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989, and the British Computer Misuse Act in 1990.[7][9].The growth in computer crime during the 1980s and 1990s caused law enforcement agencies to begin establishing specialized groups, usually at the national level, to handle the technical aspects of investigations.", "Color space": "A color space is a specific organization of colors.In combination with color profiling supported by various physical devices, it supports reproducible representations of color\u2013 whether such representation entails an analog or a digital representation.A color space may be arbitrary, i.e.with physically realized colors assigned to a set of physical color swatches with corresponding assigned color names (including discrete numbers in\u2013 for example\u2013 the Pantone collection), or structured with mathematical rigor (as with the NCS System, Adobe RGB and sRGB).A \"color space\" is a useful conceptual tool for understanding the color capabilities of a particular device or digital file.When trying to reproduce color on another device, color spaces can show whether shadow/highlight detail and color saturation can be retained, and by how much either will be compromised..A \"color model\" is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (e.g.triples in RGB or quadruples in CMYK); however, a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation.Adding a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space establishes within the reference color space a definite \"footprint\", known as a gamut, and for a given color model, this defines a color space.For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model.When defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see..Since \"color space\" identifies a particular combination of the color model and the mapping function, the word is often used informally to identify a color model.", "Labor day": "Labor Day is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the first Monday in September to honor and recognize the American labor movement and the works and contributions of laborers to the development and achievements of the United States.[1][2][3].Beginning in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labor movements grew, trade unionists proposed that a day be set aside to celebrate labor.\"Labor Day\" was promoted by the Central Labor Union and the Knights of Labor, which organized the first parade in New York City.In 1887, Oregon was the first state of the United States to make it an official public holiday.By the time it became an official federal holiday in 1894, thirty states in the U.S.officially celebrated Labor Day.[4].Canada's Labour Day is also celebrated on the first Monday of September.More than 80 other countries celebrate International Workers' Day on May 1, the European holiday of May Day.May Day was chosen by the Second International of socialist and communist parties to commemorate the general  labor strike in the United States and events leading to the Haymarket affair, which occurred in Chicago on May 1 \u2013 May 4, 1886.[5][6].Beginning in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labor movements grew, diverse groups of trade unionists chose a variety of days on which to celebrate labor.In the United States, a September holiday called Labor Day was first proposed in the early 1880s..Alternative accounts of the event's origin exist.", "Life insurance": "Life insurance (or life assurance, especially in the Commonwealth of Nations) is a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurer or assurer, where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money upon the death of an insured person (often the policyholder).Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness can also trigger payment.The policyholder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum.The benefits may include other expenses, such as funeral expenses..Life policies are legal contracts and the terms of each contract describe the limitations of the insured events.Often, specific exclusions written into the contract limit the liability of the insurer; common examples include claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot, and civil commotion.Difficulties may arise where an event is not clearly defined, for example, the insured knowingly incurred a risk by consenting to an experimental medical procedure or by taking medication resulting in injury or death..Modern life insurance bears some similarity to the  asset-management industry,[1][failed verification] and life insurers have diversified their product offerings into retirement products such as  annuities.[2].Life-based contracts tend to fall into two major categories:.An early form of life insurance dates to Ancient Rome; \"burial clubs\"[3] covered the cost of members' funeral expenses and assisted survivors financially.In 1816, an archeological excavation in Minya, Egypt (under an Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire) produced a Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty-era tablet from the ruins of the Temple of Antinous in Antino\u00f6polis, Aegyptus that prescribed the rules and membership dues of a burial society collegium established in Lanuvium, Italia in approximately 133 AD during the reign of Hadrian (117\u2013138) of the Roman Empire.[4] In 1851, future U.S.Supreme Court Associate Justice Joseph P.", "Chinese New Year": "Chinese New Year is the festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar.In Chinese, the festival is commonly referred to as the Spring Festival (traditional Chinese: \u6625\u7bc0; simplified Chinese: \u6625\u8282; pinyin: Ch\u016bnji\u00e9)[2] as the spring season in the lunisolar calendar traditionally starts with lichun, the first of the twenty-four solar terms which the festival celebrates around the time of the Chinese New Year.[3] Marking the end of winter and the beginning of the spring season, observances traditionally take place from Chinese New Year's Eve, the evening preceding the first day of the year, to the Lantern Festival, held on the 15th day of the year.The first day of Chinese New Year begins on the new moon that appears between 21 January and 20 February.[note 1].Chinese New Year is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, and has strongly influenced Lunar New Year celebrations of its 56 ethnic groups, such as the Losar of Tibet (Tibetan: \u0f63\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f66\u0f62\u0f0b), and of China's neighbours, including the Korean New Year (Korean:\uc124\ub0a0; RR:Seollal), and the T\u1ebft of Vietnam,[5] as well as in Okinawa.[6] It is also celebrated worldwide in regions and countries that house significant Overseas Chinese or Sinophone populations, especially in Southeast Asia.These include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar,[7] the Philippines,[8] Singapore,[9] Thailand, and Vietnam.It is also prominent beyond Asia, especially in Australia, Canada, Mauritius,[10] New Zealand, Peru,[11] South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as various European countries.[12][13][14].The Chinese New Year is associated with several myths and customs.The festival was traditionally a time to honour deities as well as ancestors.[15] Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the New Year vary widely,[16] and the evening preceding the New Year's Day is frequently regarded as an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner.It is also a tradition for every family to thoroughly clean their house, in order to sweep away any ill fortune and to make way for incoming good luck.Another custom is the decoration of windows and doors with red paper-cuts and couplets.Popular themes among these paper-cuts and couplets include good fortune or happiness, wealth, and longevity.Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in red envelopes..", "Mitzi Kapture": "Mitzi Kapture (born Mitzi Gaynor Donahue; May 2, 1962[1]) is an American actress, known for her role as Sgt.Rita Lee Lance in the CBS/USA Network crime drama series

second console in the Xbox series.It competed with Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles.It was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information announced later that month at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3).[18][19][20][21][22].The Xbox 360 features an online service, Xbox Live, which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console's lifetime.Available in free and subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: play games online; download games (through Xbox Live Arcade) and game demos; purchase and stream music, television programs, and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications.In addition to online multimedia features, it allows users to stream media from local PCs.Several peripherals have been released, including wireless controllers, expanded hard drive storage, and the Kinect motion sensing camera.The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment.[23][24][25][26][27].Launched worldwide across 2005\u20132006, the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions, including North America and Europe.The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate, indicated by the so-called \"Red Ring of Death\", necessitating an extension of the device's warranty period.Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console: the Xbox 360 S in 2010,[28] and the Xbox 360 E in 2013.[29] Xbox 360 is the ninth-highest-selling home video game console in history, and the highest-selling console made by an American company.", "Backpack": "A backpack\u2014also called  knapsack, rucksack, pack, booksack, bookbag, or backsack\u2014is, in its simplest frameless form, a fabric sack carried on one's back and secured with two straps that go over the shoulders, but it can have an external frame, internal frame, and there are bodypacks..Backpacks are commonly used by hikers and students, and are often preferred to handbags for carrying heavy loads or carrying any sort of equipment, because of the limited capacity to carry heavy weights for long periods of time in the hands..Large backpacks, used to carry loads over 10 kilograms (22lb), as well as smaller sports backpacks (e.g.running, cycling, hiking, and hydration), usually offload the largest part (up to about 90%) of their weight onto padded hip belts, leaving the shoulder straps mainly for stabilising the load.This improves the potential to carry heavy loads, as the hips are stronger than the shoulders, and also increases agility and balance, since the load rides nearer the wearer's own center of mass..The word backpack was coined in the United States in the 1910s.Moneybag and packsack were used prior, and now occur mainly as regionalisms..The word rucksack is a German loanword mainly used in the UK, US and in other Western military forces.In Middle High German ruck(e) means \"back\" (dorsum), which led to the Upper German word ruggsack.In modern German the word \"der Rucksack\" is commonly used.[1] The name rucksack is cognate with the Danish rygs\u00e6k, Norwegian ryggsekk, Dutch rugzak, Afrikaans rugsak, Swedish ryggs\u00e4ck, and Russian \u0440\u044e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043a (rjukzak)..The word knapsack was the usual name for a rucksack or backpack up until the middle of the 20th century.This is commonly used in Canada..", "Mexico": "Mexico (Spanish: M\u00e9xico),[a][b] officially the United Mexican States,[c] is a country in the southern portion of North America.It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico.[11] Mexico covers 1,972,550km2 (761,610 sq mi),[12] making it the world's 13th-largest country by area; with a population of almost 130 million, it is the 10th-most-populous country and has the most Spanish speakers.[13] Mexico is organized as a federal republic comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its capital..Human presence in Pre-Columbian Mexico goes back to 8,000 BCE.It became one of the world's six cradles of civilization.The Mesoamerican region was home to many intertwined civilizations, including the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, and Purepecha.The Aztecs dominated the region in the century before European contact.In 1521, the Spanish Empire and its indigenous allies conquered the Aztec Empire from its capital Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), establishing the colony of New Spain.[14] Over the next three centuries, Spain and the Catholic Church expanded the territory, enforced Christianity and spread the Spanish language.[15] With the discovery of rich deposits of silver in Zacatecas and Guanajuato, New Spain became one of the most important mining centers worldwide.The colonial order came to an end in the early nineteenth century with the Mexican War of Independence..Mexico's early history as an independent nation state was marked by political and socioeconomic upheaval, both domestically and in foreign affairs.The United States invaded as a consequence of the Texas Revolt by American settlers, which led to the Mexican\u2013American War and huge territorial losses in 1848.[16] After the introduction of liberal reforms in the Constitution of 1857, conservatives reacted with the War of Reform and prompted France to invade the country and install an Empire, against the Republican resistance led by liberal President Benito Ju\u00e1rez, which emerged victorious.The last decades of the 19th century were dominated by the dictatorship of Porfirio D\u00edaz, who sought to modernize Mexico and restore order.[17] However, the Porfiriato era led to great social unrest and ended with the outbreak in 1910 of the decade-long Mexican Revolution (civil war).This conflict led to profound changes, including the proclamation of the 1917 Constitution, which remains in effect to this day.", "Slugging percentage": "In baseball statistics, slugging percentage (SLG) is a measure of the batting productivity of a hitter.It is calculated as total bases divided by at-bats, through the following formula, where AB is the number of at-bats for a given player, and 1B, 2B, 3B, and HR are the number of singles, doubles, triples, and home runs, respectively:.Unlike batting average, slugging percentage gives more weight to extra-base hits such as doubles and home runs, relative to singles.Plate appearances resulting in walks, hit-by-pitches, catcher's interference, and sacrifice bunts or flies are specifically excluded from this calculation, as such an appearance is not counted as an at-bat (these are not factored into batting average either)..The name is a misnomer, as the statistic is not a percentage but an average of how many bases a player achieves per at bat.It is a scale of measure whose computed value is a number from 0 to 4.This might not be readily apparent given that a Major League Baseball player's slugging percentage is almost always less than 1 (as a majority of at bats result in either 0 or 1 base).The statistic gives a double twice the value of a single, a triple three times the value, and a home run four times.[2] The slugging percentage would have to be divided by 4 to actually be a percentage (of bases achieved per at bat out of total bases possible).As a result, it is occasionally called slugging average, or simply slugging, instead.[3].A slugging percentage is always expressed as a decimal to three decimal places, and is generally spoken as if multiplied by 1000.For example, a slugging percentage of .589 would be spoken as \"five eighty nine,\" and one of 1.127 would be spoken as \"eleven twenty seven.\".A slugging percentage is not just for the use of measuring the productivity of a hitter.", "Chrono Trigger": "Chrono Trigger[b] is a 1995 role-playing video game developed and published by Square.It was originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as the first game in the Chrono series.The game's development team included three designers that Square dubbed the \"Dream Team\": Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of Square's Final Fantasy series; Yuji Horii, creator of Enix's Dragon Quest series; and Akira Toriyama, character designer of Dragon Quest and author of the Dragon Ball manga series.In addition, Takashi Tokita co-directed the game and co-wrote the scenario, Kazuhiko Aoki produced the game,[1] Masato Kato wrote most of the story, while composer Yasunori Mitsuda wrote most of the soundtrack before falling ill and deferring the remaining tracks to Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu.[2][3] The game's story follows a group of adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe..Chrono Trigger was a critical and commercial success upon release and is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time.Nintendo Power magazine described aspects of the game as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related side-quests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.[4] Chrono Trigger was the second best-selling game of 1995 in Japan,[5] and shipped 2.65 million copies worldwide by March 2003.[6] Excluding the PC version, the game had shipped over 3.5 million copies worldwide by February 2018..Square released a ported version by Tose in Japan for the PlayStation in 1999, which was later repackaged with a Final Fantasy IV port as Final Fantasy Chronicles (2001) for the North American market.A slightly enhanced Chrono Trigger, again ported by Tose, was released for the Nintendo DS in North America and Japan in 2008, and PAL regions in 2009.[7] The game has also been ported to i-mode, the Virtual Console, the PlayStation Network, iOS, Android, and Windows..Chrono Trigger features standard role-playing video game gameplay.The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game's two-dimensional world, consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons.Navigation occurs via an overworld map, depicting the landscape from a scaled-down overhead view.Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled-down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies.", "Goat cheese": "Goat cheese, goat's cheese, or ch\u00e8vre (/\u02c8\u0283\u025bvr\u0259/ or /\u02c8\u0283\u025bv/; from the French fromage de ch\u00e8vre, 'goat cheese')[1] is cheese made from goat's milk.Goats were among the first animals to be domesticated for producing food.[2] Goat cheese is made around the world with a variety of recipes, giving many different styles of cheeses, from fresh and soft to aged and hard.[3].Goats produce high-quality, nutrient-rich milk under even the most difficult environments, making them valuable to arid or mountainous areas where cattle and sheep cannot survive.[4] Goats were one of the earliest animals domesticated to suit human needs\u2014more specifically milk production\u2014going back to 8,000 BC, 10,000 years ago.[2] Goat cheese has been made for at least as far back as 5,000 BC;[5] the first documented proof of humans making cheese of any kind dates to 7,500 years ago in Poland..Goat milk has higher proportions of medium-chain fatty acids, such as caproic and caprylic, which contribute to the characteristic tart/\"goat\" flavor of the cheese.[6] They also make goat milk and cheeses more easily digestible.[7].Goat milk, and therefore goat cheeses, contain anti-inflammatory enzymes, probiotics, antioxidants, proteins, and lipids and help maintain a healthy metabolism.These fatty acids take their name from the Latin for 'goat', capra.[8] It is also high in calcium, vitamins A and K, phosphorus, thiamin, and niacin.[4] Overall, the consumption of 60 grams (2.1oz) per day of cheese (both control and enriched), within the context of a balanced hypocaloric diet and recommendations for physical activity, was effective for the reduction of body weight, body mass index and waist circumference.[9].Goat cheese is made like other cheeses.The milk is filtered to remove unwanted impurities or deposits.A curdling starter agent is added, which can be rennet, or one or more starter bacteria that affect the curds' size and eventually the cheese's consistency.Some examples of starters are Lactococcus lactis lactis, L.l.cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus.", "Hyperthermia": "Hyperthermia, also known simply as overheating, is a condition in which an individual's body temperature is elevated beyond normal due to failed thermoregulation.The person's body produces or absorbs more heat than it dissipates.When extreme temperature elevation occurs, it becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death.[citation needed] Almost half a million deaths are recorded every year from hyperthermia.[citation needed].The most common causes include heat stroke and adverse reactions to drugs.Heat stroke is an acute temperature elevation caused by exposure to excessive heat, or combination of heat and humidity, that overwhelms the heat-regulating mechanisms of the body.The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs, particularly those that affect the central nervous system.Malignant hyperthermia is a rare complication of some types of general anesthesia.Hyperthermia can also be caused by a traumatic brain injury.[4][5][6].Hyperthermia differs from fever in that the body's temperature set point remains unchanged.The opposite is hypothermia, which occurs when the temperature drops below that required to maintain normal metabolism.The term is from Greek  \u1f51\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1, hyper, meaning \"above\", and  \u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, thermos, meaning \"heat\"..In humans, hyperthermia is defined as a temperature greater than 37.5\u201338.3\u00b0C (99.5\u2013100.9\u00b0F), depending on the reference used, that occurs without a change in the body's  temperature set point.[3][10].", "Belize": "in the Americas.Belize (/b\u026a\u02c8li\u02d0z, b\u025b-/ \u24d8, bih-LEEZ, beh-; Belize Kriol English: Bileez) is a country on the north-eastern coast of Central America.It is bordered by Mexico to the north, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Guatemala to the west and south.It also shares a water boundary with Honduras to the southeast.It has an area of 22,970 square kilometres (8,867sqmi) and a population of 441,471 (2022).[6] Its mainland is about 290km (180mi) long and 110km (68mi) wide.It is the least populated and least densely populated country in Central America.Its population growth rate of 1.87% per year (2018 estimate) is the second-highest in the region and one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere.Its capital is Belmopan, and its largest city is the namesake city of Belize City.Belize is often thought of as a Caribbean country in Central America because it has a history similar to that of English-speaking Caribbean nations.Belize's institutions and official language reflect its history as a British colony..The Maya civilization spread into the area of Belize between 1500BC and AD 300 and flourished until about 1200.[11] European contact began in 1492 when Christopher Columbus sailed along the Gulf of Honduras.[12] European exploration was begun by English settlers in 1638.Spain and Britain both laid claim to the land until Britain defeated the Spanish in the Battle of St.", "Betsy Ross flag": "The Betsy Ross flag is a reconstructed early design for the flag of the United States, which is conformant to the Flag Act of 1777 and has red stripes outermost and stars arranged in a circle.These details elaborate on the 1777 act, passed early in the American Revolutionary War, which specified 13 alternating red and white horizontal stripes and 13 white stars in a blue canton.Its name stems from the story, once widely believed, that shortly after the 1777 act, upholsterer and flag maker Betsy Ross produced a flag of this design.[1].Betsy Ross (1752\u20131836) was an upholsterer in Philadelphia who produced uniforms, tents, and flags for Continental forces.Although her manufacturing contributions are documented, a popular story evolved in which Ross was hired by a group of Founding Fathers to make a new U.S.flag.According to the legend, she deviated from the 6-pointed stars in the design and produced a flag with 5-pointed stars, instead.The claim by her descendants that Betsy Ross contributed to the flag's design is not generally accepted by modern American scholars and vexillologists.[2].Ross became a notable figure representing the contribution of women in the American Revolution,[3] but how this specific design of the U.S.flag became associated with her is unknown.An 1851 painting by Ellie Sully Wheeler of Philadelphia displayed Betsy Ross sewing a U.S.flag.[4][5] The National Museum of American History suggests that the Betsy Ross story first entered into American consciousness about the time of the 1876 Centennial Exposition celebrations.[6].", "Purr": "A purr is a tonal fluttering sound made by some species of felids, including both larger, outdoor cats and the domestic cat (Felis catus), as well as two species of genets.It varies in loudness and tone among species and in the same animal..Although true purring is exclusive to felids and viverrids,[1] other animals such as raccoons produce vocalizations that sound similar to true purring.Animals that produce purr-like sounds include mongooses, kangaroos, wallabies, wallaroos, badgers, rabbits and guinea pigs.[citation needed].Animals purr for a variety of reasons, including to express happiness or fear, and as a defense mechanism.It has also been shown that cats purr to manage pain and soothe themselves.[2] Purring is a soft buzzing sound, similar to a rolled 'r' with a fundamental frequency of around 25Hz.[3]  This sound occurs with noticeable vibrations on the surface of the body, varies in a rhythmic pattern during breathing and occurs continuously during inhalation and exhalation.The intensity and length of the purr can also vary depending on the level of arousal of the animal.[3].The mechanism by which cats purr is an object of speculation, with different hypotheses proposed.An early idea was that purring is a hemodynamic process where sound is produced as the blood runs through the thorax.[4].There is a unique \"neural oscillator\" in the cat's brain of uncertain significance.[5] Although the mechanism has not yet been fully explained, recent studies have inferred it could be the result of oscillatory mechanisms in the central nervous system.[6] Studies have also shown that purring can be caused through electrically stimulating the infundibular region of the cat's brain, suggesting central control.[7].One hypothesis, backed by electromyographic studies, is that cats produce the purring noise by using the vocal folds or the muscles of the larynx to alternately dilate and constrict the glottis rapidly, causing air vibrations during inhalation and exhalation.[8] Combined with the steady inhalation and exhalation of air as the cat breathes, a purring noise is produced with strong harmonics.[9].No cat can both purr and roar.", "Platypus": "The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus),[3] sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus,[4] is a semiaquatic, egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania.The platypus is the sole living representative or  monotypic taxon of its family Ornithorhynchidae and genus Ornithorhynchus, though a number of related species appear in the fossil record..Together with the four species of echidna, it is one of the five extant species of monotremes, mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.Like other monotremes, the platypus senses prey in cloudy water through electrolocation.It is one of the few species of venomous mammals, as the male platypus has a spur on the hind foot that delivers an extremely painful venom..The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal at first baffled European naturalists.In 1799, the first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body judged it a fake made of several animals sewn together..The unique features of the platypus make it important in the study of evolutionary biology, and a recognisable and iconic symbol of Australia.It is culturally significant to several Aboriginal peoples, who also used to hunt it for food.It has appeared as a national mascot, features on the reverse of the Australian twenty-cent coin, and is an emblem of the state of New South Wales..The platypus was hunted for its fur, but it has been a legally protected species in all states where it occurs since 1912.[5] Its population is not under severe threat, although captive-breeding programs have had slight success, and it is vulnerable to pollution.It is classified as a near-threatened species by the IUCN, but a November 2020 report has recommended that it be upgraded to threatened species under the federal EPBC Act, due to habitat destruction and declining numbers in all states.[6].", "St. Elizabeth, Missouri": "St.Elizabeth or Saint Elizabeth is a village in Miller County, Missouri, United States.[2] The population was 336 at the 2010 census..St.Elizabeth was originally called Charlestown, and under the latter name was platted in 1875, and named after Charley Holtschneider, the original owner of the town site.[4] A post office called St.Elizabeth has been in operation since 1877.[5] The present name is derived from a local Roman Catholic church of the same name, which in turn most likely was named after Elizabeth of Hungary.[4].The Boeckman Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.[6].St.Elizabeth is located in northeast Miller County at the intersection of Missouri routes 52 and E.The Osage River flows past two miles west of the community.Tuscumbia is approximately ten miles to the west and Meta in adjacent Osage County is 6.5 miles to the northeast.[7].According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.02 square miles (2.64km2), all land.[8].As of the census[10] of 2010, there were 336 people, 115 households, and 84 families living in the

land..Historically the Wilton vicinity has been a locale of considerable haying and pasture usage; the depth to groundwater is typically about 150 to 175 feet (46 to 53 meters)..Wilton lies partially in the floodplain of the Cosumnes River.Because some areas of Wilton are in a flood zone, water can be in the streets during the rainy season.In 1997, an El Nino/La Nina year, levees broke and some homes were flooded to the rooftops.On New Years Eve of 2022, parts of Wilton were evacuated due to a flood warning after levee breaches on the Cosumnes River.[4].The 2010 United States Census[5] reported that Wilton had a population of 5,363.The population density was 184.9 inhabitants per square mile (71.4/km2).The racial makeup of Wilton was 2,234 (78.9%) White, 169 (3.2%) African American, 45 (0.8%) Native American, 289 (5.4%) Asian, 13 (0.2%) Pacific Islander, 343 (6.4%) from other races, and 270 (5.0%) from two or more races.", "Cut, copy, and paste": "Cut, copy, and paste are essential commands of modern human\u2013computer interaction and user interface design.They offer an interprocess communication technique for transferring data through a computer's user interface.The cut command removes the selected data from its original position, and the copy command creates a duplicate; in both cases the selected data is kept in temporary storage called the clipboard.Clipboard data is later inserted wherever a paste command is issued.The data remains available to any application supporting the feature, thus allowing easy data transfer between applications..The command names are an interface metaphor based on the physical procedure used in manuscript print editing to create a page layout, like with paper.The commands were pioneered into computing by Xerox PARC in 1974, popularized by Apple Computer in the 1983 Lisa workstation and the 1984 Macintosh computer, and in a few home computer applications such the 1984 word processor Cut & Paste..This interaction technique has close associations with related techniques in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that use pointing devices such as a computer mouse (by drag and drop, for example).Typically, clipboard support is provided by an operating system as part of its GUI and widget toolkit..The capability to replicate information with ease, changing it between contexts and applications, involves privacy concerns because of the risks of disclosure when handling sensitive information.Terms like cloning, copy forward, carry forward, or re-use refer to the dissemination of such information through documents, and may be subject to regulation by administrative bodies.[1].The term \"cut and paste\" comes from the traditional practice in manuscript editing, whereby people cut paragraphs from a page with scissors and paste them onto another page.", "Economic order quantity": "Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), also known as Financial Purchase Quantity or Economic Buying Quantity (EPQ), is the order quantity that minimizes the total holding costs and ordering costs in inventory management.It is one of the oldest classical production scheduling models.The model was developed by Ford W.Harris in 1913, but R.H.Wilson, a consultant who applied it extensively, and K.Andler are given credit for their in-depth analysis.[1].EOQ applies only when demand for a product is constant over the year and each new order is delivered in full when inventory reaches zero.There is a fixed cost for each order placed, regardless of the number of units ordered; an order is assumed to contain only 1 unit.There is also a cost for each unit held in storage, commonly known as holding cost, sometimes expressed as a percentage of the purchase cost of the item.Although the EOQ formulation is straightforward,  factors such as transportation rates and quantity discounts factor into any real-world application..The EOQ indicates the optimal number of units to order to minimize the total cost associated with the purchase, delivery, and storage of the product..", "Stevie Ray Vaughan": "Stephen Ray Vaughan (also known as SRV; October 3, 1954 \u2013 August 27, 1990) was an American musician, best known as the guitarist and frontman of the blues rock trio Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble.Although his mainstream career spanned only seven years, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians in the history of blues music, and one of the greatest guitarists of all time.He was the younger brother of guitarist Jimmie Vaughan..Born and raised in Dallas, Vaughan began playing guitar at age seven, initially inspired by his elder brother, Jimmie Vaughan.In 1972, he dropped out of high school and moved to Austin, where he began to gain a following after playing gigs on the local club circuit.Vaughan joined forces with Tommy Shannon on bass and Chris Layton on drums as Double Trouble in 1978 and established it as part of the Austin music scene; it soon became one of the most popular acts in Texas.He performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1982, where David Bowie saw him play.Bowie contacted him for a studio gig that resulted in Vaughan playing blues guitar on the album Let's Dance (1983), before being discovered by John Hammond who interested major label Epic Records in signing Vaughan and his band to a record deal.Within months, they achieved mainstream success for the critically acclaimed debut album Texas Flood.With a series of successful network television appearances and extensive concert tours, Vaughan became the leading figure in the blues revival of the 1980s..During the majority of his life, Vaughan struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction.He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame and his marriage to Lenora \"Lenny\" Bailey.", "Coca-Cola": "Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company.In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8billion company beverage servings each day.[1] Coca-Cola ranked No.87 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[2] Based on Interbrand's \"best global brand\" study of 2020, Coca-Cola was the world's sixth most valuable brand.[3].Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, Coca-Cola was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia.In 1888, Pemberton sold the ownership rights to Asa Griggs Candler, a businessman, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the global soft-drink market throughout the 20th and 21st century.[4] The name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts (a source of caffeine).[5] The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.The secrecy around the formula has been used by Coca-Cola in its marketing as only a handful of anonymous employees know the formula.[6] The drink has inspired imitators and created a whole classification of soft drink: colas..The Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world.The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners.A typical 12-US-fluid-ounce (350ml) can contains 38 grams (1.3oz) of sugar (usually in the form of high-fructose corn syrup in North America).The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world.The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors..The Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name.", "Barry Larkin": "Barry Louis Larkin (born April 28, 1964) is an American former professional baseball player.He played shortstop for the Cincinnati Reds of  Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1986 to 2004..He briefly played in the minor leagues before making his MLB debut in 1986.He quickly won the starting shortstop role for the Reds and enjoyed a long run of strong seasons with the team.Larkin struggled with a string of injuries between 1997 and 2003, limiting his playing time in several seasons..Larkin retired after the 2004 season and worked in a front-office position for the Washington Nationals for several years until he joined ESPN as a baseball analyst.He served as a coach for the American team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic and managed the Brazilian national team for the same event in 2013..Larkin is considered one of the top players of his era, winning nine Silver Slugger awards, three Gold Glove awards, and the 1995 National League Most Valuable Player Award.He was selected to the Major League All-Star Game twelve times, and was one of the pivotal players on the 1990 Reds' World Series championship team.[1] Larkin was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in January 2012 and was inducted on July 22, 2012.[2].Born and raised in the Cincinnati suburb of Silverton, Ohio, and raised Catholic, Larkin attended Archbishop Moeller High School.[1] Larkin accepted a football scholarship to the University of Michigan to play for coach Bo Schembechler, but during his freshman year, he decided to play baseball exclusively.He was a two-time All-American and led the Wolverines to berths in two College World Series, in 1983 and 1984 (the last time until 2019).Larkin was also named Big Ten Player of the Year in 1984 and 1985.[3] Larkin's number 16 was retired by the school on May 1, 2010.[2] Baseball at the 1984 Summer Olympics saw Larkin playing for the United States team..", "Bras\u00c3\u00adlia": "Ivan Ferreira Serpa (April 6, 1923\u2013April 6, 1973) was a Brazilian painter, draftsman, printmaker, designer, and educator active in the concrete art movement.[1] Much of his work was in geometric abstractionism.He founded Grupo Frente, which included fellow artists Lygia Clark, Helio Oiticica, and Franz Weissmann, among others, and was known for mentoring many artists in Brazil.[2][3].Serpa was born in the Tijuca neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[4].From 1946 to 1948, Serpa studied printmaking with printmaker Axl Leskoschek in Rio de Janeiro.Serpa was also mentored by the art critic, M\u00e1rio Pedrosa.But in general terms, Serpa did not have much formal training in art.[3].From 1949 and 1952, Serpa taught painting, sculpture, and art theory at the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, where he often held an open studio which incorporated critical review of student work with a new pedagogy of allowing instinctual exploration of innate creativity.The teaching style also reflected new ideas about national identity, and had a focus on the modern, incorporating ideas of democracy that were taking place in the country as a whole \u2013 all in direct contrast to the more traditional, European based art school model.[3][5].This weekly event became a salon for many up and coming artists that would later be major contributors to the neo-concrete and concrete art movement in Brazil.[6].Serpa had also previously taught art therapy to psychiatric patients at the Occupational Therapy center of the National Psychiatric Hospital in Brazil.[3].Serpa's first works were created in 1951.The paintings were serialized, and often incorporated architectural elements..", "Causes of World War I": "The identification of the causes of World War I remains a debated issue.World War I began in the Balkans on July 28, 1914, and hostilities ended on November 11, 1918, leaving 17 million dead and 25 million wounded.Moreover, the Russian Civil War can in many ways be considered a continuation of World War I, as can various other conflicts in the direct aftermath of 1918..Scholars looking at the long term seek to explain why two rival sets of powers (the German Empire and Austria-Hungary against the Russian Empire, France, the British Empire and later the United States) came into conflict by 1915.They look at such factors as political, territorial and economic competition; militarism, a complex web of alliances and alignments; imperialism, the growth of nationalism; and the power vacuum created by the decline of the Ottoman Empire.Other important long-term or structural factors that are often studied include unresolved territorial disputes, the perceived breakdown of the European balance of power,[1][2] convoluted and fragmented governance, arms races and security dilemmas,[3][4] a cult of the offensive,[1][5][4] and military planning.[6].Scholars seeking short-term analysis focus on the summer of 1914 and ask whether the conflict could have been stopped, or instead whether deeper causes made it inevitable.Among the immediate causes were the decisions made by statesmen and generals during the July Crisis, which was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by the Bosnian Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip, who had been supported by a nationalist organization in Serbia.[7] The crisis escalated as the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia was joined by their allies Russia, Germany, France, and ultimately Belgium and the United Kingdom.Other factors that came into play during the diplomatic crisis leading up to the war included misperceptions of intent (such as the German belief that Britain would remain neutral), the fatalistic belief that war was inevitable, and the speed with which the crisis escalated, partly due to delays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications..The crisis followed a series of diplomatic clashes among the Great Powers (Italy, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary and Russia) over European and colonial issues in the decades before 1914 that had left tensions high.And the cause of the public clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe that had been taking place since 1867.[8].Consensus on the origins of the war remains elusive, since historians disagree on key factors and place differing emphasis on a variety of factors.", "National flag": "A national flag is a flag that represents and symbolizes a given nation.It is flown by the government of that nation, but can also be flown by its citizens.A national flag is typically designed with specific meanings for its colours and symbols, which may also be used separately from the flag as a symbol of the nation.The design of a national flag is sometimes altered after the occurrence of important historical events.The burning or destruction of a national flag is a greatly symbolic act..Historically, flags originated as military standards, used as field signs.Throughout history, various examples of such proto-flags exist: the white cloth banners of the Zhou dynasty's armies in the 11th century BC, the vexillum standards flown by the armies of the Roman Empire, the Black Standard famously carried by Muhammad which later became the flag of the Abbasid Caliphate, and the various \"Raven banners\" flown by Viking chieftains.Angelino Dulcert published a series of comprehensive Portolan charts in the 14th century AD, which famously showcased the flags of several polities depicted \u2013 although these are not uniformly \"national flags\", as some were likely the personal standards of the respective nation's rulers..The practice of flying flags indicating the country of origin outside of the context of warfare became common with the maritime flag.The current design of the flag of the Netherlands originates as a variant of the late 16th century orange-white-blue Prinsenvlag (\"Prince's Flag\"), that was used in the Dutch War of Independence (1568\u20131648), evolving in the early 17th century as the red-white-blue Statenvlag (\"States Flag\"), the naval flag of the States-General of the Dutch Republic, making the Dutch flag perhaps the oldest tricolour flag in continuous use, although standardisation of the exact colours is of a much later date.[1][2].During the age of sail in the early 17th century, the Union Jack finds its origins, when James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones (as James I).On 12 April 1606, the new flag representing this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the flag of England (a red cross on a white background, known as St George's Cross), and the flag of Scotland (a white saltire on a blue background, known as the Saltire or St Andrew's Cross), would be joined, forming the flag of Great Britain and first Union Flag[3] - but then without the red Cross of St.", "American Civil War": "365,000+ total dead[9].290,000+ total dead.The American Civil War (April 12, 1861\u2013 May 26, 1865; also known by other names) was a civil war in the United States between the Union[e] (\"the North\") and the Confederacy (\"the South\"), which had been formed by states that had seceded from the Union.The cause of the war was the dispute over whether slavery would be permitted to expand into the western territories, leading to more slave states, or be prevented from doing so, which many believed would place slavery on a course of ultimate extinction..Decades of political controversy over slavery were brought to a head by the victory in the 1860 U.S.presidential election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed slavery's expansion into the western territories.Seven southern slave states responded to Lincoln's victory by seceding from the United States and forming the Confederacy.The Confederacy seized U.S.forts and other federal assets within their borders.Four more southern states seceded after the war began and, led by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy asserted control over about a third of the U.S.population in eleven states.Four years of intense combat, mostly in the South, ensued..", "Norrie disease": "Norrie disease is a rare disease and genetic disorder that primarily affects the eyes and almost always leads to blindness.It is caused by mutations in the Norrin cystine knot growth factor (NDP) gene, which is located on the X chromosome.[1][2] In addition to the congenital ocular symptoms, the majority of patients experience a progressive hearing loss starting mostly in their 2nd decade of life, and some may have learning difficulties among other additional characteristics..Patients with Norrie disease may develop cataracts, leukocoria (where the pupils appear white when light is shone on them), along with other developmental issues in the eye, such as shrinking of the globe and the wasting away of the iris.[2] Around 30 to 50% of them will also have developmental delay or learning difficulties, psychotic-like features, incoordination of movements or behavioral abnormalities.[2] Most patients are born with normal hearing; however, the onset of hearing loss is very common in early adolescence.[3] About 15% of patients are estimated to develop all the features of the disease.[4].Due to the X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance, Norrie disease affects almost entirely males.Only in very rare cases, females have been diagnosed with Norrie disease; cases of symptomatic female carriers have been reported.[5][6] It is a very rare disorder that is not associated with any specific ethnic or racial groups, with cases reported worldwide (including cases in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australasia).[7][8][9][10] While more than 400 cases have been described, the prevalence and incidence of the disease still remains unknown.[11][12].The most prominent symptoms initially observed in Norrie disease are ocular.Initial characteristics are usually identified at birth or in early infancy, with parents often noticing abnormal eye features or that their child fails to show a response to light.[13][14][15] The first visible finding is leukocoria, a grayish-yellow pupillary reflection that originates from a mass of disorganized tissue behind the lens.This material, which possibly includes an already detached retina, may be confused with a tumor and thus is termed pseudoglioma.[2][11] However, an affected baby may have a normally sized eye globe and unremarkable iris, anterior chamber, cornea and intraocular pressure.Over the first few months of life, complete or partial retinal detachment evolves.From infancy through childhood, the patient may undergo progressive changes in the disease.[2] Disease progression often includes vitreoretinal hemorrhages, the formation of cataracts, deterioration of the iris with adhesions forming between the iris and the lens or the cornea, and shallowing of the anterior chamber which may increase intraocular pressure, causing eye pain.[2] As the situation worsens, there is corneal opacification, where the cornea becomes opaque, and band keratopathy.Intraocular pressure is lost and the globe shrinks.In the last stage of Norrie disease, the globes appear small and sunken in (phthisis bulbi) and the cornea appears to be milky.[2].", "Contract": "A contract is an agreement that specifies certain legally enforceable rights and obligations pertaining to two or more mutually agreeing parties.A contract typically involves the transfer of goods, services, money, or a promise to transfer any of those at a future date, and the activities and intentions of the parties entering into a contract may be referred to as contracting.In the event of a breach of contract, the injured party may seek judicial remedies such as damages or rescission.[1] A binding agreement between actors in international law is known as a treaty..Contract law, the field of the law of obligations concerned with contracts, is based on the principle that agreements must be honoured.[2] Like other areas of private law, contract law varies between jurisdictions.In general, contract law is exercised and governed either under common law jurisdictions, civil law jurisdictions, or mixed-law jurisdictions that combine elements of both common and civil law.Common law jurisdictions typically require contracts to include consideration in order to be valid, whereas civil and most mixed-law jurisdictions solely require a meeting of the minds between the parties..Within the overarching category of civil law jurisdictions, there are several distinct varieties of contract law with their own distinct criteria: the German tradition is characterised by the unique doctrine of abstraction, systems based on the Napoleonic Code are characterised by their systematic distinction between different types of contracts, and Roman-Dutch law is largely based on the writings of renaissance-era Dutch jurists and case law applying general principles of Roman law prior to the Netherlands' adoption of the Napoleonic Code.The UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, published in 2016, aim to provide a general harmonised framework for international contracts, independent of the divergences between national laws, as well as a statement of common contractual principles for arbitrators and judges to apply where national laws are lacking.Notably, the Principles reject the doctrine of consideration, arguing that elimination of the doctrine \"bring[s] about greater certainty and reduce litigation\" in international trade.[3] The Principles also rejected the abstraction principle on the grounds that it and similar doctrines are \"not easily compatible with modern business perceptions and practice\".[3].Contract law can be contrasted with tort law (also referred to in some jurisdictions as the law of delicts), the other major area of the law of obligations.While tort law generally deals with private duties and obligations that exist by operation of law, and provide remedies for civil wrongs committed between individuals not in a pre-existing legal relationship, contract law provides for the creation and enforcement of duties and obligations through a prior agreement between parties.The emergence of quasi-contracts, quasi-torts, and quasi-delicts renders the boundary between tort and contract law somewhat uncertain.[4].", "ASP.NET": "ASP.NET is an open-source,[2] server-side web-application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages.It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, applications and services.The name stands for Active Server Pages Network Enabled Technologies..It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology.ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language.The ASP.NET SOAP extension framework allows ASP.NET components to process SOAP messages..Microsoft briefly marketed ASP.NET Core as ASP.NET's successor, however beginning August 2022 it reverted to the old ASP.NET name.[3] This new version is a re-implementation of ASP.NET as a modular web framework, together with other frameworks like Entity Framework.The new framework uses the new open-source .NET Compiler Platform (codename \"Roslyn\") and is cross platform.ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Web Pages (a platform using only Razor pages) have merged into a unified MVC 6.[4].ASP.NET supports a number of programming models for building web applications:[5].Other ASP.NET extensions include:.On IIS6.0 and lower, pages written using different versions of the ASP framework cannot share session state without the use of third-party libraries.", "Lysergic acid diethylamide": "Lysergic acid diethylamide, commonly known as LSD (from German Lysergs\u00e4ure-diethylamid), and known colloquially as acid or lucy is a potent psychedelic drug.[12] Effects typically include intensified thoughts, emotions, and sensory perception.[13] At sufficiently high dosages LSD manifests primarily mental, visual, and auditory hallucinations.[14][15] Dilated pupils, increased blood pressure, and increased body temperature are typical.[16] Effects typically begin within half an hour and can last for up to 20 hours (although on average, experiences last 8\u201312 hours).[16][17] LSD is also capable of causing mystical experiences and ego dissolution.[15][18] It is used mainly as a recreational drug or for spiritual reasons.[16][19] LSD is both the prototypical psychedelic and one of the \"classical\" psychedelics, being the psychedelic with the greatest scientific and cultural significance.[12] LSD is synthesized as a solid compound, typically in the form of a powder or a crystalline material.This solid LSD is then dissolved in a liquid solvent, such as ethanol or distilled water, to create a solution.The liquid serves as a carrier for the LSD, allowing for accurate dosage and administration onto small pieces of blotter paper called tabs.LSD is typically either swallowed or held under the tongue.[13].LSD is pharmacologically considered to be non-addictive with a low potential for abuse.Adverse psychological reactions are possible, such as anxiety, paranoia, and delusions.[7] In rare cases, LSD can induce \"flashbacks\", known as hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, in which a person experiences apparent lasting or persistent visual hallucinations or perceptual distortions, such as visual snow and palinopsia.[20][21].LSD is structurally related to substituted tryptamines, a class of compounds that includes psilocybin, the active compound found in psychedelic mushrooms.Thus, LSD shares some mechanisms of action and psychedelic effects with psilocybin and other tryptamines.[22][23][24].The effects of LSD are thought to stem primarily from it being an agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor.While exactly how LSD exerts its effects by agonism at this receptor is not fully understood, corresponding increased glutamatergic neurotransmission and reduced default mode network activity are thought to be key mechanisms of action.[7][12][25][26][27] In addition to serotonin, LSD also binds to dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, which is thought to contribute to reports of LSD being more stimulating than compounds such as psilocybin.[28][29] In pure form, LSD is clear or white in color, has no smell, and is crystalline.[13] It breaks down with exposure to ultraviolet light.[16].LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann in 1938 from lysergic acid, a chemical derived from the hydrolysis of ergotamine, an alkaloid found in ergot, a fungus that infects grain.[16][20] LSD was the 25th of various lysergamides Hofmann synthesized from lysergic acid while trying to develop a new analeptic, hence the alternate name LSD-25.Hofmann discovered its effects in humans in 1943, after unintentionally ingesting an unknown amount, possibly absorbing it through his skin.[30][31][32] LSD was subject to exceptional interest within the field of psychiatry in the 1950s and early 1960s, with Sandoz distributing LSD to researchers under the trademark name Delysid in an attempt to find a marketable use for it.[31].", "United States Navy SEALs": "The United States Navy Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL) Teams, commonly known as Navy SEALs, are the U.S.Navy's primary special operations force and a component of the Naval Special Warfare Command.Among the SEALs' main functions are conducting small-unit special operation missions in maritime, jungle, urban, arctic, mountainous, and desert environments.SEALs are typically ordered to capture or kill high level targets, or to gather intelligence behind enemy lines.[7] SEAL team personnel are hand selected, highly trained, and possess a high degree of proficiency in direct action (DA), and special reconnaissance (SR), among other tasks like sabotage, demolition, intelligence gathering, and hydro-graphic reconnaissance, training, and advising friendly militaries or other forces.[8].Depending on the availability of platforms, threat level, and environment, different methods can be used for the insertion and extraction of SEALs into a target location.This could include nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines equipped with dry deck shelters, SDV submarines, surface vessels, surface swimming, or other vehicles..All active SEALs are members of the U.S.Navy.[12] The CIA's highly secretive and elite Special Operations Group (SOG) recruits operators from SEAL Teams,[13] with joint operations going back to the MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War.[14] This cooperation still exists today, as evidenced by military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.[15][16].Although not formally founded until 1962, the modern-day U.S.Navy SEALs trace their roots to World War II.[7] The United States Military recognized the need for the covert reconnaissance of landing beaches and coastal defenses.As a result, the joint Army, Marine Corps, and Navy Amphibious Scout and Raider School was established in 1942 at Fort Pierce, Florida.[11] The Scouts and Raiders were formed in September of that year, just nine months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, from the Observer Group, a joint U.S.Army-Marine-Navy unit..", "World population": "In world demographics, the world population is the total number of humans currently living.It was estimated by the United Nations to have exceeded eight billion in mid-November 2022.It took around 300,000 years of human prehistory and history for the human population to reach one billion and only 222 years more to reach 8billion.[3].The human population has experienced continuous growth following the Great Famine of 1315\u20131317 and the end of the Black Death in 1350, when it was nearly 370,000,000.[4] The highest global population growth rates, with increases of over 1.8% per year, occurred between 1955 and 1975, peaking at 2.1% between 1965 and 1970.[5] The growth rate declined to 1.1% between 2015 and 2020 and is projected to decline further in the 21st century.[6] The global population is still increasing, but there is significant uncertainty about its long-term trajectory due to changing fertility and mortality rates.[7] The UN Department of Economics and Social Affairs projects between 9 and 10billion people by 2050 and gives an 80% confidence interval of 10\u201312billion by the end of the 21st century,[2] with a growth rate by then of zero.Other demographers predict that the human population will begin to decline in the second half of the 21st century.[8].The total number of births globally is currently (2015\u20132020) 140 million/year, which is projected to peak during the period 2040\u20132045 at 141million/year and then decline slowly to 126million/year by 2100.[9] The total number of deaths is currently 57million/year and is projected to grow steadily to 121million/year by 2100.[10].The median age of human beings as of 2020[update] is 31 years.[11].Estimates of world population by their nature are an aspect of modernity, possible only since the Age of Discovery.Early estimates for the population of the world[12] date to the 17th century: William Petty, in 1682, estimated the world population at 320 million (current estimates ranging close to twice this number); by the late 18th century, estimates ranged close to one billion (consistent with current estimates).[13] More refined estimates, broken down by continents, were published in the first half of the 19th century, at 600 million to 1billion in the early 1800s and 800million to 1billion in the 1840s.[14].It is difficult for estimates to be better than rough approximations, as even current population estimates are fraught with uncertainties from 3% to 5%.[15].Estimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15million.[16][17] Even earlier, genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BC, according to the now largely discredited Toba catastrophe theory.By contrast, it is estimated that around 50\u201360million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD.[18].", "Memphis, Tennessee": "Memphis is a city in the U.S.state of Tennessee.It is the seat of Shelby County in the southwest part of the state; it is situated along the Mississippi River.With a population of 633,104 at the 2020 U.S.census,[6] Memphis is the second-most populous city in Tennessee after Nashville..Memphis is the fifth-most populous city in the Southeast, the nation's 28th-most populous overall, as well as the largest city bordering the Mississippi River and third largest metropolitan statistical area behind Greater St.Louis and the Twin Cities on the Mississippi River.[7] The Memphis metropolitan area includes West Tennessee and the greater Mid-South region, which includes portions of neighboring Arkansas, Mississippi and the Missouri Bootheel.One of the more historic and culturally significant cities of the Southern United States, Memphis has a wide variety of landscapes and distinct neighborhoods..The first European explorer to visit the area of present-day Memphis was Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1541.The high Chickasaw Bluffs protecting the location from the waters of the Mississippi was contested by European settlers as Memphis developed.By 1819, when modern Memphis was founded, it was part of the United States territory.John Overton, James Winchester, and Andrew Jackson founded the city.[8] Based on the wealth of cotton plantations and river traffic along the Mississippi, Memphis grew into one of the largest cities of the Antebellum South.", "Nuclear power by country": "Nuclear power plants operate in 32 countries and generate about a tenth of the world's electricity.[1].Most are in Europe, North America, East Asia and South Asia..The United States is the largest producer of nuclear power, while France has the largest share of electricity generated by nuclear power, at about 70%.[2].China has the fastest growing nuclear power programme with 16 new reactors under construction, followed by India, which has 8 under construction.[when?][3].Some countries operated nuclear reactors in the past but have no operating nuclear plants..Among them, Italy closed all of its nuclear stations by 1990 and nuclear power has since been discontinued because of the 1987 referendums..Kazakhstan is[when?] planning to reintroduce nuclear power in the future.[4] Belarus began operating one unit of its first nuclear power plant in June 2021 and was expecting to bring the second unit into operation in 2023.[5].Germany completed the shut down of its nuclear fleet on April 15, 2023 and any restart has been ruled out on technical grounds.[6] Austria (Zwentendorf Nuclear Power Plant) and the Philippines (Bataan Nuclear Power Plant) never started to use their first nuclear plants that were completely built..Sweden and Belgium originally had phase-out policies however they have now moved away from their original plans.The Philippines relaunched their nuclear programme on February 28, 2022 and may soon operate the mothballed Bataan Plant.[7][8].Due to financial, political and technical reasons, Cuba, Libya and Poland never completed the construction of their first nuclear plants, and Australia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ghana, Ireland, Kuwait, Oman, Peru and Singapore never built their planned first nuclear plants.[9][10] Some of these countries are still planning to introduce nuclear power.As of 2020, Poland was in advanced planning phase for 1.5 GW and planned to have up to 9 GW by 2040.[11].", "List of muscles of the human body": "This is a table of skeletal muscles of the human anatomy, with muscle counts and other information..A more detailed

"Seminole Wars": "Second Seminole War.The Seminole Wars (also known as the Florida Wars) were a series of three military conflicts between the United States and the Seminoles that took place in Florida between about 1816 and 1858.The Seminoles are a Native American nation which coalesced in northern Florida during the early 1700s, when the territory was still a Spanish colonial possession.Tensions grew between the Seminoles and settlers in the newly independent United States in the early 1800s, mainly because enslaved people regularly fled from Georgia into Spanish Florida, prompting slaveowners to conduct slave raids across the border.A series of cross-border skirmishes escalated into the First Seminole War in 1817, when General Andrew Jackson led an incursion into the territory over Spanish objections.Jackson's forces destroyed several Seminole and Black Seminole towns and briefly occupied Pensacola before withdrawing in 1818.The U.S.and Spain soon negotiated the transfer of the territory with the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819..The United States gained possession of Florida in 1821 and coerced the Seminoles into leaving their lands in the Florida panhandle for a large Indian reservation in the center of the peninsula per the Treaty of Moultrie Creek.About ten years later, however, the US government under President Andrew Jackson demanded that they leave Florida altogether and relocate to Indian Territory per the Indian Removal Act.A few bands reluctantly complied but most resisted violently, leading to the Second Seminole War (1835-1842), which was by far the longest and most wide-ranging of the three conflicts.Initially, less than 2000 Seminole warriors employed hit-and-run guerilla warfare tactics and knowledge of the land to evade and frustrate a combined U.S.", "Orono, Maine": "Orono (/\u02c8\u0252r\u0259no\u028a/) is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States.Located on the Penobscot and Stillwater rivers, it was first settled by American colonists in 1774.They named it in honor of Chief Joseph Orono, a sachem of the indigenous Penobscot nation who long occupied this territory..In the nineteenth century, the town became a center of the lumber industry.Sawmills on the rivers were powered by the water, and logs were floated downriver on the Penobscot for shipping and export from coastal ports..Since 1865 it has been the location of the University of Maine, established as a land-grant institution and the state's flagship educational institution.In the fall of 2018, the university enrolled 11,404 students at Orono.Not including university residents, the town's population was 11,183 at the 2020 census.[2].According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 19.60 square miles (50.76km2), of which 18.19 square miles (47.11km2)  is land and 1.41 square miles (3.65km2) is water.[1] The town is divided by the Stillwater River, a branch of the Penobscot River.It occupies part of  Marsh Island, as well as some smaller islands such as Ayers Island, which is surrounded by the Penobscot and the Stillwater rivers, and the remainder of the town is on the mainland.The Orono Dam impounds the Stillwater River at its confluence with the Penobscot River near downtown Orono.[3].This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often

powerful man-made light in the world..The Luxor was developed by Circus Circus Enterprises at a cost of $375 million.Construction began on April 21, 1992, and the resort opened on October 15, 1993, with 2,526 rooms.A renovation and expansion project, costing $300 million, took place from 1996 to 1997.The project included the addition of two 22-story hotel towers, as well as Nevada's first 3D IMAX theater.The Egyptian theme was scaled back as well, including the removal of an indoor Nile River ride..MGM acquired the Luxor in 2005.The company launched a $300 million renovation two years later, further scaling back on the Egyptian theme while adding new restaurants and clubs.", "Pilot experiment": "A pilot experiment, pilot study, pilot test or pilot project is a small-scale preliminary study conducted to evaluate feasibility, duration, cost, adverse events, and improve upon the study design prior to performance of a full-scale research project.[1][2].Pilot experiments are frequently carried out before large-scale quantitative research, in an attempt to avoid time and money being used on an inadequately designed project.A pilot study is usually carried out on members of the relevant population.[1] A pilot study is used to formulate the design of the full-scale experiment which then can be adjusted.[1][2] The pilot study is potentially a critical insight to clinical trial design,.recruitment and sample size of participants, treatment testing, and statistical analysis to improve the power of testing the hypothesis of the study.[2] Analysis from the pilot experiment can be added to the full-scale (and more expensive) experiment to improve the chances of a clear outcome.[1][2].In sociology, pilot studies can be referred to as small-scale studies that will help identify design issues before the main research is done.Although pilot experiments have a well-established tradition, their usefulness as a strategy for change has been questioned, at least in the domain of environmental management.[3] Extrapolation from a pilot study to large scale strategy may not be assumed as possible, partly due to the exceptional resources and favorable conditions that accompany a pilot study.[1].In clinical research, studies conducted in preparation for a future randomized controlled trial are known as \"pilot\" and \"feasibility\" studies, where pilot studies are a subset of feasibility studies.[1][4] A feasibility study asks whether the study should proceed, and if so, how.A pilot study asks the same questions, but also has a specific design feature: in a pilot study, a future study is conducted on a smaller scale,[1][5] which, if having produced positive results, may lead to a Phase I clinical trial.[6] The use of pilot and feasibility studies to estimate treatment effect is controversial, with ongoing methodologic discussion about appropriateness.[7].A checklist was published in 2016 to provide guidance on how to report pilot trials.[8].Main

Angeles Fire Department (LAFD or LA City Fire) provides Firefighting Services as well as Technical Rescue Services,Hazardous Materials Services and Emergency Medical Services to the city of Los Angeles, California, United States.[6] The LAFD is responsible for approximately 4 million people who live in the agency's 471 square miles (1,220km2) jurisdiction.[7] The Los Angeles Fire Department was founded in 1886 and is the third largest municipal fire department in the United States, after the New York City Fire Department and the Chicago Fire Department.The department may be unofficially referred to as the Los Angeles City Fire Department or \"LA City Fire\" to distinguish it from the Los Angeles County Fire Department which serves the county and whose name may directly confuse people, as the county seat is the city.Another possible reason is that the city and the unincorporated county are often bordering each other and thus the two appear to be serving the same area.The department is currently under the command of chief Kristin Crowley..The Los Angeles Fire Department has it origins in the year 1871.[8][9][10] In September of that year, George M.Fall, the County Clerk for Los Angeles County organized Engine Company No.1.It was a volunteer firefighting force with an Amoskeag fire engine and a hose jumper (cart).The equipment was hand-drawn to fires.In the spring of 1874, the fire company asked the Los Angeles City Council to purchase horses to pull the engine.The Council refused and the fire company disbanded.[11].Many of the former members of Engine Company No.", "Acre": "The acre (/\u02c8e\u026ak\u0259r/ AY-k\u0259r) is a unit of land area used in the British imperial and the United States customary systems.It is traditionally defined as the area of one chain by one furlong (66 by 660 feet), which is exactly equal to 10 square chains, 1\u2044640 of a square mile, 4,840 square yards, or 43,560 square feet, and approximately 4,047m2, or about 40% of a hectare.Based upon the international yard and pound agreement of 1959, an acre may be declared as exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres.The acre is sometimes abbreviated ac[1] but is usually spelled out as the word \"acre\".[2].Traditionally, in the Middle Ages, an acre was conceived of as the area of land that could be ploughed by one man using a team of 8 oxen in one day.[3].The acre is still a statutory measure in the United States.Both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but they differ by only four parts per million (see below).The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land..The acre is commonly used in many current and former Commonwealth of Nations countries by custom only.In a few, it continues as a statute measure, although since 2010 not in the UK, and not since decades ago in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.In many of those where it is not a statute measure, it is still lawful to \"use for trade\" if given as supplementary information and is not used for land registration..One acre equals 1\u2044640 (0.0015625) square mile, 4,840 square yards, 43,560 square feet,[2] or about 4,047 square metres (0.4047

communicate ideas and feelings, and how such communications are processed and understood.Language processing is considered to be a uniquely human ability that is not produced with the same grammatical understanding or systematicity in even human's closest primate relatives.[1].Throughout the 20th century the dominant model[2] for language processing in the brain was the Geschwind-Lichteim-Wernicke model, which is based primarily on the analysis of brain-damaged patients.However, due to improvements in intra-cortical electrophysiological recordings of  monkey and human brains, as well non-invasive techniques such as fMRI, PET, MEG and EEG, a dual auditory pathway[3][4] has been revealed and a two-streams model has been developed.In accordance with this model, there are two pathways that connect the auditory cortex to the frontal lobe, each pathway accounting for different linguistic roles.The auditory ventral stream pathway is responsible for sound recognition, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'what' pathway.The auditory dorsal stream in both humans and non-human primates is responsible for sound localization, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'where' pathway.In humans, this pathway (especially in the left hemisphere) is also responsible for speech production, speech repetition, lip-reading, and phonological working memory and long-term memory.In accordance with the 'from where to what' model of language evolution,[5][6] the reason the ADS is characterized with such a broad range of functions is that each indicates a different stage in language evolution..The division of the two streams first occurs in the auditory nerve where the anterior branch enters the anterior cochlear nucleus in the brainstem which gives rise to the auditory ventral stream.The posterior branch enters the dorsal and posteroventral cochlear nucleus to give rise to the auditory dorsal stream.[7]:\u200a8.Language processing can also occur in relation to signed languages or written content..", "Bugatti Veyron": "The Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 is a mid-engine sports car, designed and developed in Germany by the Volkswagen Group and Bugatti and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti.It was named after the racing driver Pierre Veyron..The original version has a top speed of 407km/h (253mph).[5][6] It was named the 2000s Car of the Decade by the BBC television programme Top Gear.The standard Veyron also won Top Gear's Best Car Driven All Year award in 2005..The Super Sport version of the Veyron is one of the fastest street-legal production cars in the world, with a top speed of 431.072km/h (267.856mph).[7] The Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse was the fastest roadster in the world, reaching an averaged top speed of 408.84km/h (254.04mph) in a test on 6 April 2013.[8][9].The Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warku\u00df, with the exterior being designed by Jozef Kaba\u0148 of Volkswagen.Much of the engineering work was conducted under the guidance of chief technical officer Wolfgang Schreiber.The Veyron includes a sound system designed and built by Burmester Audiosysteme.[10].Several special variants have been produced.In December 2010, Bugatti began offering prospective buyers the ability to customise exterior and interior colours by using the Veyron 16.4 Configurator application on the marque's official website.[11][12] The Bugatti Veyron was discontinued in late 2014, but special edition models continued to be produced until 2015..In May 1998, Volkswagen AG acquired the rights to use the Bugatti logo and the trade name Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S.To succeed the EB 110 model produced under the previous ownership, the automaker quickly released a series of concept cars whose technological advancements would culminate in the form of the Veyron 16.4..", "DVD": "The DVD (common abbreviation for Digital Video Disc or Digital Versatile Disc)[8][9] is a digital optical disc data storage format.It was invented and developed in 1995 and first released on November 1, 1996, in Japan.The medium can store any kind of digital data and has been widely used for video programs (watched using DVD players) or formerly for storing software and other computer files as well.DVDs offer significantly higher storage capacity than compact discs (CD) while having the same dimensions.A standard single-layer DVD can store up to 4.7 GB of data, a dual-layer DVD up to 8.5 GB.Variants can store up to a maximum of 17.08 GB.[10].Prerecorded DVDs are mass-produced using molding machines that physically stamp data onto the DVD.Such discs are a form of DVD-ROM because data can only be read and not written or erased.Blank recordable DVD discs (DVD-R and DVD+R) can be recorded once using a DVD recorder and then function as a DVD-ROM.Rewritable DVDs (DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM) can be recorded and erased many times..DVDs are used in DVD-Video consumer digital video

performances, retro showmanship, and for performing in a wide range of musical styles, including pop, R&B, funk, soul, reggae, disco, and rock.Mars is accompanied by his band, the Hooligans, who play a variety of instruments, such as electric guitar, bass, piano, keyboards, drums, and horns, and also serve as backup singers and dancers..Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Mars moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career.Following a brief contract with Motown Records, he first established his name in the music industry as a songwriter.In 2009, he co-founded the production team The Smeezingtons, responsible for various successful singles for Mars himself and other artists.He rose to fame as a solo artist in 2010 buoyed by the success of \"Nothin' on You\" by B.o.B and \"Billionaire\" by Travie McCoy, both of which featured his vocals.In the same year, Mars released his debut studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, which blended pop with reggae and R&B.It spawned the international number-one singles \"Just the Way You Are\", \"Grenade\", and \"The Lazy Song\".Drawing inspiration from disco, funk, rock, reggae and soul genres, his second studio album, Unorthodox

Mark Ronson's \"Uptown Funk\", which topped various music charts, spending a total of fourteen and seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, respectively.", "Greek Mythology": "Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks, and a genre of ancient Greek folklore, today absorbed alongside Roman mythology into the broader designation of classical mythology.These stories concern the ancient Greek religion's view of the origin and nature of the world; the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and mythological creatures; and the origins and significance of the ancient Greeks' cult and ritual practices.Modern scholars study the myths to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece, and to better understand the nature of myth-making itself.[1].The Greek myths were initially propagated in an oral-poetic tradition most likely by Minoan and Mycenaean singers starting in the 18th centuryBC;[2] eventually the myths of the heroes of the Trojan War and its aftermath became part of the oral tradition of Homer's epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey.Two poems by Homer's near contemporary Hesiod, the Theogony and the Works and Days, contain accounts of the genesis of the world, the succession of divine rulers, the succession of human ages, the origin of human woes, and the origin of sacrificial practices.Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns, in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle, in lyric poems, in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth centuryBC, in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age, and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias..Aside from this narrative deposit in ancient Greek literature, pictorial representations of gods, heroes, and mythic episodes featured prominently in ancient vase paintings and the decoration of votive gifts and many other artifacts.Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth centuryBC depict scenes from the Epic Cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles.In the succeeding Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.[3].Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture, arts, and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language.Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes.[4]:\u200a43.Greek mythology is known today primarily from Greek literature and representations on visual media dating from the Geometric period from c.\u2009900BC to c.\u2009800BC onward.[5]:\u200a200\u200a In fact, literary and archaeological sources integrate, sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict; however, in many cases, the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots.[6].", "Mouth & MacNeal": "The mouth is the body orifice through which many animals ingest food and vocalize.The body cavity immediately behind the mouth opening, known as the oral cavity (or cavum oris in Latin),[1] is also the first part of the alimentary canal which leads to the pharynx and the gullet.In tetrapod vertebrates, the mouth is bounded on the outside by the lips and cheeks \u2014 thus the oral cavity is also known as the buccal cavity (from Latin bucca, meaning \"cheek\")[2] \u2014 and contains the tongue on the inside.Except for some groups like birds and lissamphibians, vertebrates usually have teeth in their mouths,[3] although some fish species have pharyngeal teeth instead of oral teeth..Most bilaterian phyla, including arthropods, molluscs and chordates, have a two-opening gut tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other.Which end forms first in ontogeny is a criterion used to classify bilaterian animals into protostomes and deuterostomes..In the first multicellular animals, there was probably no mouth or gut and food particles were engulfed by the cells on the exterior surface by a process known as endocytosis.The particles became enclosed in vacuoles into which enzymes were secreted and digestion took place intracellularly.The digestive products were absorbed into the cytoplasm and diffused into other cells.This form of digestion is used nowadays by simple organisms such as Amoeba and Paramecium and also by sponges which, despite their large size, have no mouth or gut and capture their food by endocytosis.[4].However, most animals have a mouth and a gut, the lining of which is continuous with the epithelial cells on the surface of the body.A few animals which live parasitically originally had guts but have secondarily lost these structures.", "Boise State Broncos football": "The Boise State Broncos football program represents Boise State University in college football and competes in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as a member of the Mountain West Conference.The Broncos play their home games on campus at Albertsons Stadium in Boise, Idaho, and their head coach is Andy Avalos.The program is 13\u20137 in bowl games since 1999, has finished in the top 25 13 times since 2002, has the longest current streak of winning seasons in college football with 25.It also has a 3\u20130 record in the Fiesta Bowl.As of the end of the 2022 season, the Broncos' all-time winning percentage of .728 is the fifth highest in all of collegiate football.[2].Originally a junior college, Boise State first fielded a football team in 1933 under head coach Dusty Kline.[3] That team compiled a record of 1\u20132\u20131 (.375).[3][4] Kline was succeeded by Max Eiden.[4] Under Eiden, the Broncos posted a record of 11\u201317\u20131 (.397) from 1934 to 1937.[4] Eiden was succeeded by Harry Jacoby, who coached the team from 1938 to the middle of the 1941 season before being called into Army service.The remainder of the 1941 season was coached by George \"Stub\" Allison, who posted a record of 2\u20131 (.667).[4] The Broncos did not compete in intramural football from 1942 to 1945 due to having a reduced male student population during World War II.[4] Following the war, Jacoby would return to coach the Broncos for one more season in 1946, posting a final record of 14\u201315\u20132 (.484).After a year as an assistant, Lyle Smith was promoted to head football coach of Boise Junior College in 1947.Smith saw incredible success as head coach, winning his first 31 games in a row as head coach.In 1950, the team moved into a new 10,000-seat stadium.With the outbreak of the Korean War, Smith, still undefeated as a head coach, was recalled to the Navy and was only able to coach in the first three games of the 1950 season.[5][6] George Blankley assumed the head coaching duties for the remainder of 1950 and the entire 1951 season in Smith's absence and compiled a 16\u20132 (.889) record.Smith returned as head coach in 1952 and stretched his winning streak all the way to 37

Karno company, which took him to the United States.He was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios.He soon developed the Tramp persona and attracted a large fan base.He directed his own films and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations.By 1918, he was one of the world's best-known figures..", "Planned parenthood": "The Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc.(PPFA), or simply Planned Parenthood, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization[4] that provides reproductive and sexual healthcare, and sexual education in the United States and globally.It is a member of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)..PPFA has its roots in Brooklyn, New York, where Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, in 1916.Sanger founded the American Birth Control League in 1921,[5] and 14 years after her exit as its president, ABCL's successor organization became Planned Parenthood in 1942..Planned Parenthood consists of 159 medical and non-medical affiliates, which operate over 600 health clinics in the United States.[2][3] It partners with organizations in 12 countries globally.[2][3] The organization directly provides a variety of reproductive health services and sexual education, contributes to research in reproductive technology and advocates for the protection and expansion of reproductive rights.[3] Research shows that closures of Planned Parenthood clinics lead to increases in maternal mortality rates.[6][7].PPFA is the largest single provider of reproductive health services and the largest single provider of abortion in the United States.[11][12] In their 2014 Annual Report, PPFA reported seeing over 2.5million patients in over 4million clinical visits and performing a total of nearly 9.5million discrete services including 324,000 abortions.[15] Its combined annual revenue is US$1.3billion, including approximately $530million in government funding such as Medicaid reimbursements.[3][14] Throughout its history, PPFA, and its member clinics have experienced support, controversy, protests,[16] and violent attacks.[17].The origins of Planned Parenthood date to October 16, 1916, when Margaret Sanger, her sister Ethel Byrne, and Fania Mindell opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S.in the Brownsville section of the New York borough of Brooklyn.[18] They distributed birth control, birth control advice, and birth control information.All three women were arrested[19][20][21] and jailed for violating provisions of the Comstock Act, accused of distributing obscene materials at the clinic.The so-called Brownsville trials brought national attention and support to their cause.Sanger and her co-defendants were convicted on misdemeanor charges, which they appealed through two subsequent appeals courts.", "Mens rea": "In criminal law, mens rea (/\u02c8m\u025bnz \u02c8re\u026a\u0259/; Law Latin for \"guilty mind\"[1]) is the mental state of a defendant who is accused of committing a crime.In common law jurisdictions, most crimes require proof both of mens rea and actus reus (\"guilty act\") before the defendant can be found guilty..The standard common law test of criminal liability is expressed in the Latin phrase actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea,[2] i.e.\"the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty\".[3][4] As a general rule, someone who acted without mental fault is not liable in criminal law.[5][6] Exceptions are known as strict liability crimes.[7][8][9] Moreover, when a person intends a harm, but as a result of bad aim or other cause the intent is transferred from an intended victim to an unintended victim, the case is considered to be a matter of transferred intent.[10]:\u200a63\u201364\u200a[11].The types of mental states that apply to crimes vary depending on whether a jurisdiction follows criminal law under the common law tradition or, within the United States, according to the Model Penal Code.[12].In civil law, it is usually not necessary to prove a subjective mental element to establish liability for breach of contract or tort, for example.But if a tort is intentionally committed or a contract is intentionally breached, such intent may increase the scope of liability and the damages payable to the plaintiff..In some jurisdictions, the terms mens rea and actus reus have been replaced by alternative terminology.[13]:\u200a95\u200a[14]:\u200a84.Under the tradition of common law, judges would often require a \"bad state of mind\" in addition to an action or omission (actus reus) to find a criminal guilty.[15][16][17] Over time, culpable mental states (mens rea) became varied among different types of crimes.[15] Such crimes and mental states might include, for example, \"malice\" for murder, \"fraudulence\" for fraud, \"willfulness and corruption\" for perjury, and so on.[15] The crime of manslaughter, further, might not even require a \"bad mind\" but simply a \"negligent\" one.[15] Regardless of how the requirements are categorized, the Supreme Court has explained mens rea requirements for crimes are \"universal\" and essential to \"mature systems of law\", even going so far as to say that this belief undergirds notions of free will and morality.[18].Within the United States, there is no single encompassing criminal law.Criminal laws are passed and enforced by the states\u201a or the federal government, but each of these criminal \"codes\" vary and may or may not draw from the same theoretical sources.[19].The vast majority of criminal prosecutions in the United States are carried out by the several states in accordance with the laws of the state in question.", "Ulysses S. Grant": "Ulysses S.Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant;[b] April 27, 1822\u2013 July 23, 1885) was an American military officer and politician who served as the 18th president of the United States from 1869 to 1877.As commanding general, he led the Union Army to victory in the American Civil War in 1865 and thereafter briefly served as U.S.secretary of war.Later, as president, Grant was an effective civil rights executive who signed the bill that created the Justice Department and worked with Radical Republicans to protect African Americans during Reconstruction..Born and raised in Ohio, Grant attended West Point and graduated with the class of 1843, going on to serve with distinction in the Mexican\u2013American War.He resigned from the army in 1854, returning to civilian life impoverished.In 1861, shortly after the American Civil War began, Grant joined the Union Army and quickly rose to prominence after winning early Union victories in the western theater.In 1863, he led the Vicksburg campaign, gaining control of the Mississippi River, dealing a serious strategic blow to the Confederacy.President Abraham Lincoln promoted him to lieutenant general after his victory at Chattanooga.For thirteen months, Grant fought Robert E.Lee during the high-casualty Overland Campaign which ended with capture of Lee's army at Appomattox, where he formally surrendered to Grant.",

letters and numbers on them, which are used to select specific records.Some may use compact discs instead.Disc changers are similar devices for home use; they are small enough to fit on a shelf and can hold up to hundreds of discs, allowing them to be easily removed, replaced, or inserted by the user..Coin-operated music boxes and player pianos were the first forms of automated coin-operated musical devices.These devices used paper rolls, metal disks, or metal cylinders to play a musical selection on an actual instrument, or on several actual instruments, enclosed within the device..In the 1890s, these devices were joined by machines which used recordings instead of actual physical instruments.[1][2].In 1889, Louis Glass and William S.Arnold invented the nickel-in-the-slot phonograph, in San Francisco.[3] This was an Edison Class M Electric Phonograph retrofitted with a device patented under the name of 'Coin Actuated Attachment for Phonograph'.The music was heard via one of four listening tubes.[4].In 1928, Justus P.Seeburg, who was manufacturing player pianos, combined an electrostatic loudspeaker with a record player that was coin-operated.[5] This 'Audiophone' machine was wide and bulky because it had eight separate turntables mounted on a rotating Ferris wheel-like device, allowing patrons to select from eight different records..", "Drug test": "A drug test (also often toxicology screen or tox screen) is a technical analysis of a biological specimen, for example urine, hair, blood, breath, sweat, or oral fluid/saliva\u2014to determine the presence or absence of specified parent drugs or their metabolites.Major applications of drug testing include detection of the presence of performance enhancing steroids in sport, employers and parole/probation officers screening for drugs prohibited by law (such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin) and police officers testing for the presence and concentration of alcohol (ethanol) in the blood commonly referred to as BAC (blood alcohol content).BAC tests are typically administered via a breathalyzer while urinalysis is used for the vast majority of drug testing in sports and the workplace.Numerous other methods with varying degrees of accuracy, sensitivity (detection threshold/cutoff), and detection periods exist..A drug test may also refer to a test that provides quantitative chemical analysis of an illegal drug, typically intended to help with responsible drug use.[1].The detection windows depend upon multiple factors: drug class, amount and frequency of use, metabolic rate, body mass, age, overall health, and urine pH.For ease of use, the detection times of metabolites have been incorporated into each parent drug.For example, heroin and cocaine can only be detected for a few hours after use, but their metabolites can be detected for several days in urine.The chart depicts the longer detection times of the metabolites.In the case of hair testing, the metabolytes are permanently embedded into hair, and the detection time is determined by the length of the hair sample used in the analysis.The standard length of head hair used in the test is 1.5\", which corresponds to about 3 months.Body/pubic hair grows slower, and the same  1.5\" would result in a longer detection time.[2].", "Space exploration": "Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space.[1] While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight.Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science..While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality.Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.[2].The early era of space exploration was driven by a \"Space Race\" between the Soviet Union and the United States.A driving force of the start of space exploration was during the Cold War.After the ability to create nuclear weapons, the narrative of defense/offense left land and the power to control the air became the focus.Both the Soviet and the U.S.were fighting to prove their superiority in technology through exploring the unknown: space.In fact, the reason NASA was made was due to the response of Sputnik I.[3] The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period.The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971..After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS)..", "Calvin Coolidge": "Calvin Coolidge (born John Calvin Coolidge Jr.;[1] /\u02c8ku\u02d0l\u026ad\u0292/; July 4, 1872\u2013 January 5, 1933) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929..Born in Vermont, Coolidge was a Republican lawyer from New England who climbed the ladder of Massachusetts politics, becoming the state's 48th governor.His response to the Boston police strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight as a man of decisive action.The next year, Coolidge was elected the country's 29th vice president and succeeded the presidency upon the sudden death of President Warren G.Harding in 1923.Elected in his own right in 1924, Coolidge gained a reputation as a small-government conservative with a taciturn personality and dry sense of humor that earned him the nickname \"Silent Cal\".Though his widespread popularity enabled him to run for a second full term, Coolidge chose not to run again in 1928, remarking that ten years as president would be \"longer than any other man has had it\u2013 too long!\"[b].Throughout his gubernatorial career, Coolidge ran on the record of fiscal conservatism, strong support for women's suffrage, and a vague opposition to Prohibition.[2] During his presidency, he restored public confidence in the White House after the many scandals of the Harding administration.He signed into law the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, which granted U.S.citizenship to all Native Americans, and oversaw a period of rapid and expansive economic growth known as the \"Roaring Twenties\", leaving office with considerable popularity.[3] He was known for his hands-off governing approach and pro-business stances; as biographer Claude Fuess wrote: \"He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class, could interpret their longings and express their opinions.That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength.\"[4].Scholars have ranked Coolidge in the lower half of U.S.", "Espresso": "Espresso (/\u025b\u02c8spr\u025bso\u028a/ \u24d8, Italian: [e\u02c8spr\u025bsso]) is one of the most popular coffee-brewing methods, of Italian origin.[1][2] The French also made a significant contribution to the invention of the first coffee makers, predecessors of today's espresso machines, and generally to the caf\u00e9 culture.Espresso can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under pressure through finely-ground coffee beans.Espresso is the most common way of making coffee in southern Europe, especially in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and Greece, but it is also popular in the rest of the world..Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, with a viscosity similar to that of warm honey.This is due to the higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and the crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).[3] As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated..Espresso contains more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, but as its usual serving size of 25\u201330 ml (1 US oz) is much smaller than other coffee drinks, the overall caffeine content of a single serving of espresso is generally lower than that of other coffees.[4] While the exact caffeine content of any coffee drink will vary, a typical 30 millilitres (1 US fluid ounce) serving of espresso contains approximately 65 milligrams of caffeine, but a typical 240 millilitres (8 US fluid ounces) serving of drip coffee contains between 150 and 200mg of caffeine.[5][6][7].The three dispersed phases in espresso are what make this beverage unique.The first dispersed phase is an emulsion of oil droplets.The second phase is suspended solids, while the third is the layer of gas bubbles or foam.The dispersion of very small oil droplets is perceived in the mouth as creamy.This characteristic of espresso contributes to what is known as the body of the beverage.These oil droplets preserve some of the aromatic compounds that are lost to the air in other coffee forms, enhancing the strong flavor of espresso.[8].", "Brian Kelly (American football coach)": "Brian Keith Kelly (born October 25, 1961) is an American college football coach.He is the head football coach at Louisiana State University (LSU), a position he has held since the 2022 season.Kelly served as the head football coach at Grand Valley State University from 1991 to 2003, Central Michigan University from 2004 to 2006, the University of Cincinnati from 2006 to 2009, and the University of Notre Dame from 2010 to 2021.He led the Grand Valley State Lakers to consecutive NCAA Division II Football Championships in 2002 and 2003.Kelly's 2012 Notre Dame team reached the 2013 BCS National Championship Game, while his 2018 and 2020 teams made appearances in the College Football Playoff..Kelly was born in Everett, Massachusetts, and was raised in a Catholic Irish-American family in Chelsea, Massachusetts.[3] He attended St.John's Preparatory School in Danvers, Massachusetts.His father was a Boston politician.[4] He was a four-year club football player at Assumption College as a linebacker.[5] After graduating from Assumption in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in political science he served as linebackers coach, defensive coordinator, and softball coach from 1983 to 1986.[6][7].Kelly joined the Grand Valley State University staff in 1987 as a graduate assistant and defensive backs coach for Tom Beck and became the defensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator in 1989.[8][9][10] Kelly took over as head coach in 1991.[9] In his final three seasons the Lakers went 41\u20132, at one point winning 32 consecutive games.[11] The Lakers went 14\u20130 in 2002 en route to their first national title and went 14\u20131 in 2003 when they claimed their second national championship.[12][13] Kelly was named the AFCA Division II Coach of the Year after each of these championship years.[14].In his 13 years as head coach at Grand Valley State, the Lakers won five conference titles and made six Division II Playoff appearances.[15].The 2001 team set 77 NCAA, GLIAC, and school records, including the all-time Division II scoring record, averaging 58.4 points per game.[16].Kelly's record in 13 years at Grand Valley State was 118\u201335\u20132.[17].", "Sidney Crosby": "Sidney Patrick Crosby OC ONS (born August 7, 1987) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre and captain of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL).Nicknamed \"Sid the Kid\" and dubbed \"The Next One\", he was selected first overall by the Penguins in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft.Born and raised in Halifax, Crosby was considered one of the most lauded prospects in ice hockey history and is widely regarded as one of the greatest ice hockey players of all time.[2][3].During his two-year major junior career with the Rimouski Oc\u00e9anic, he earned many awards and led his club to the 2005 Memorial Cup final.Oc\u00e9anic and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League retired Crosby's jersey number 87 in 2019.Crosby debuted in the NHL during the 2005\u201306 season, recording 102 points and finishing as runner-up for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL Rookie of the Year.At 18 years and 253 days, he is the youngest player to date to reach 100 points in an NHL season.By his second season, he led the NHL with 120 points to capture the Art Ross Trophy, becoming the youngest player and the only teenager to win a scoring title in any major North American sports league.That same season, Crosby won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player (MVP) and the Lester B.Pearson Award for most outstanding player as judged by his peers.He started the 2007\u201308 season with the team's captaincy and subsequently led them to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated by the Detroit Red Wings in six games.The Penguins returned to the Finals against Detroit the following year and won in seven games; Crosby became the youngest captain in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup..", "My two cents": "\"My two cents\" (\"my 2\u00a2\") and its longer version \"put my two cents in\" is an American and Australian idiomatic expression,[1] taken from the original English idiom \"to put in my two-penny worth\"..The earliest reference to an analogue of \"two cents/pence\" appears in the lesson of the widow's mite from both the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Luke.In the biblical episode, several wealthy temple patrons donate large sums of money, while a poor widow places just two small coins into the offering.She finds greater favour with Jesus than the wealthy patrons however, as the two coins constitute her whole wealth, as opposed to a tiny fraction from the rich merchants of theirs..A possible origin may be from boxing in Nottingham during the 1900s.Jack Jetlamey, a well-known gambler despite the little money he had, was always willing to bet on Jack Johnson, a new hopeful boxer.Jetlamey was known to say \"two, two, two my two cents in for Johnson\", making the whole audience laugh at every match.[2].Other likely origins are that \"my two pennies worth\" is derived from the much older 16th-century English expression, \"a penny for your thoughts\", possibly a sarcastic response to receiving more opinion than was wanted \"I said a penny for your thoughts, but I got two pennies' worth\".There is also some belief that the idiom may have its origins in the early cost of postage in England, the \"twopenny post\", where two pennies was the normal charge of sending a letter containing one's words and thoughts or feelings to someone.[3][4].The expression is used to preface a tentative statement of one\u2019s opinion.By deprecating the opinion to follow\u2014suggesting its value is only two cents, a very small amount\u2014the user of the phrase, showing politeness and humility, hopes to lessen the impact of a possibly contentious statement..The expression is also sometimes used to preface uncontentious opinions.", "Chinese Civil War": "1927\u20131936:.Chinese Communist Party.Fujian People's Government (1933\u20131934).1927\u20131936:.Republic of China.1945\u20131949: Chinese Communist Party.1945\u20131949:.Republic of China.The Chinese Civil War was fought between the Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China and forces of the Chinese Communist Party, with armed conflict continuing intermittently from 1 August 1927 until 7 December 1949, and ending with Communist control of mainland China..The war is generally divided into two phases with an interlude: from August 1927 to 1937, the KMT\u2013CCP Alliance collapsed during the Northern Expedition, and the Nationalists controlled most of China.From 1937 to 1945, hostilities were mostly put on hold as the Second United Front fought the Japanese invasion of China with eventual help from the Allies of World War II, but even then co-operation between the KMT and CPC was minimal and armed clashes between them were common.Exacerbating the divisions within  China further was that a puppet government, sponsored by Japan and nominally led by Wang Jingwei, was set up to nominally govern the parts of China under Japanese occupation..", "112th United States Congress": "[1]The 112th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, from January 3, 2011, until January 3, 2013.It convened in Washington, D.C., on January 3, 2011, and ended on January 3, 2013, 17 days before the end of the presidential term to which Barack Obama was elected in 2008.Senators elected to regular terms in 2006 completed those terms in this Congress.This Congress included the last House of Representatives elected from congressional districts that were apportioned based on the 2000 census.[2][3].In the 2010 midterm elections, the Republican Party won the majority in the House of Representatives.While the Democrats kept their Senate majority, it was reduced from the previous Congress.[4].This was the first Congress in which the House and Senate were controlled by different parties since the 107th Congress (2001\u20132003), and the first Congress to begin that way since the 99th Congress (1985\u20131987).[citation needed] It was also the first Congress since the 36th Congress, over 150 years, in which the Republican Party held the House but not the Senate.In this Congress, the House of Representatives had the largest number of Republican members, 242, since the 80th Congress (1947\u20131949).[5] This was the only Congress between the 79th (1945\u20131947) and the 117th (2021\u20132023) that did not include a member of the Kennedy family..As of 2022, this is the most recent Congress in which Democrats held a Senate seat in Nebraska or a House seat in Arkansas, the last in which Republicans held both Senate seats in Maine, and the last in which Democrats did not hold all seats in Connecticut..A failure to pass a 2011 federal budget nearly led to a shutdown of non-essential government services on April 9, 2011, with the furlough of 800,000 government employees appearing imminent.[10] President Obama met Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner in the days preceding the deadline but was unable to come to an agreement to pass a budget.[citation needed] A one-week budget was proposed to avoid a government shutdown and allow more time for negotiations; however, proposals from both parties could not be accommodated.[citation needed] Obama said he would veto a proposed Republican budget over Republican social spending cuts.[citation needed] This was also backed by Senate Democrats who objected to such cuts as that of Planned Parenthood.[11][12][13] However, an agreement was reached between the two parties for a one-week budget to allow for more time to negotiate after Republicans dropped their stance on the Planned Parenthood issue.[12] The two parties ultimately agreed on a 2011 federal budget the following week.[citation needed].There were many reactions to the possible shutdown with some saying the economy could be hurt during a fragile recovery[14] and others saying the lack of an unnecessary bureaucracy would not be noticed.[15] There was also criticism that while senators and representatives would continue to get paid others such as the police and military personnel would either not be paid for their work or have their payments deferred.[16].On August 2, 2011, the United States public debt was projected to reach its statutory maximum.", "Wealth in the United States": "Affluence refers to an individual's or household's economical and financial advantage in comparison to others.[1] It may be assessed through either income or wealth..In absolute terms affluence is a relatively widespread phenomenon in the United States, with over 30% of households having an income exceeding $100,000 per year and over 30% of households having a net worth exceeding $250,000, as of 2019.[2][3] However, when looked at in relative terms, wealth is highly concentrated: the bottom 50% of Americans only share 2% of total household wealth while the top 1% hold 35% of that wealth..In the United States, as of 2019, the median household income is $60,030 per year and the median household net worth is $97,300, while the mean household income is $89,930 per year and the mean household net worth is $692,100.[2][3].While income is often seen as a type of wealth in colloquial language use, wealth and income are two substantially different measures of economic prosperity.Wealth is the total value of net possessions of an individual or household, while income is the total inflow of monetary assets over a given time period.Hence the change in wealth over that time period is equal to the income minus the expenditures in that period.Income is a so-called \"flow\" variable, while wealth is a so-called \"stock\" variable..Affluence in the United States has been attributed in many cases to inherited wealth amounting to \"a substantial head start\":[6][7] in September 2012, the Institute for Policy Studies found that over 60 percent of the Forbes richest 400 Americans had grown up with substantial privilege.[8].Income is commonly used to measure affluence, although this is a relative indicator: a middle class person with a personal income of $77,500 annually and a billionaire may both be referred to as affluent, depending on reference groups.An average American with a median income of $32,000[9] ($39,000 for those employed full-time between the ages of 25 and 64)[10] when used as a reference group would justify the personal income in the tenth percentile of $77,500 being described as affluent,[9] but if this earner were compared to an executive of a Fortune 500 company, then the description would not apply.[11][12] Accordingly, marketing firms and investment houses classify those with household incomes exceeding $250,000 as mass affluent, while the threshold upper class is most commonly defined as the top 1% with household incomes commonly exceeding $525,000 annually..According to the U.S.Census Bureau, 42% of U.S.", "Rhizotomy": "A selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR), also known as a rhizotomy, dorsal rhizotomy, or a selective posterior rhizotomy, is a neurosurgical procedure that selectively cut problematic nerve roots of the spinal cord.[3][note 1] This procedure has been well-established in the literature as a surgical intervention and is used to relieve negative symptoms of neuromuscular conditions such as spastic diplegia and other forms of spastic cerebral palsy.[4] The specific sensory nerves inducing spasticity are identified using electromyographic (EMG) stimulation and graded on a scale of 1 (mild) to 4 (severe spasticity).Abnormal nerve responses (usually graded a 3 or 4) are isolated and cut, thereby reducing symptoms of spasticity.[3].Spasticity is defined as a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone in response to a stretch.[5]  This upper motor neuron condition results from a lack of descending input from the brain that would normally release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), which serves to dampen neuronal excitability in the nervous system.[6]  Spasticity is thought to be caused by an excessive increase of excitatory signals from sensory nerves without proper inhibition by GABA.[7]  Two common conditions associated with this lack of descending input are cerebral palsy and acquired brain injury.[6].Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR), less often referred to as selective posterior rhizotomy (SPR), is the most widely used form of rhizotomy, and is today a primary treatment for spastic diplegia, best done in the youngest years before bone and joint deformities from the pull of spasticity take place.Still, it can be performed safely and effectively on adults as well..SDR is a permanent procedure that addresses the spasticity at its neuromuscular root: i.e., in the central nervous system that contains the misfiring nerves that cause the spasticity of those particular muscles in the first place.After SDR, the person's spasticity is usually eliminated, revealing the \"real\" strength (or lack thereof) of the muscles underneath.SDR's result is fundamentally unlike orthopedic surgical procedures, where spasticity is left untreated..Because there is always temporary weakness after SDR, patients should work hard to strengthen the weak muscles with physical therapy and learn habits of movement and daily tasks in a body without spasticity..SDR is usually performed on the pediatric spastic cerebral palsy population between the ages of 2 and 6.This is the age range where orthopedic deformities from spasticity have not yet occurred or are minimal.It is also variously claimed by clinicians that another advantage of doing the surgery so young is that it is inherently easier for these young children to restrengthen their muscles and to re-learn how to walk, often having the effect that later in life, they do not even remember the period when they lived with the spasticity at all.", "Migrant worker": "A migrant worker is a person who migrates within a home country or outside it to pursue work.Migrant workers usually do not have the intention to stay permanently in the country or region in which they work.[1].Migrant workers who work outside their home country are also called foreign workers.They may also be called expatriates or guest workers, especially when they have been sent for or invited to work in the host country before leaving the home country..The International Labour Organization estimated in 2019 that there were 169 million international migrants worldwide.[2] Some countries have millions of migrant workers.Some migrant workers are undocumented immigrants or slaves..An estimated 14 million foreign workers live in the United States, which draws most of its immigrants from Mexico, including 4 or 5 million undocumented workers.It is estimated that around 5 million foreign workers live in Northwestern Europe, half-a-million in Japan, and 5 million in Saudi Arabia.A comparable number of dependents are accompanying international workers.[3].There are approximately 14 million non-permanent workers in the United States.Today it is estimated that there are about 10.7 million undocumented migrant workers in the United States, many of which come from Mexico and other countries in Central America.These workers often travel to the United States to look for occupational opportunities and to provide economic stability for their families.[4]  These workers risk their lives to cross the border - facing extreme heat and the risk of being caught by border control to find jobs in the United States, often facing language barriers, cultural shock, stigma, and discrimination upon reaching the United States.", "Teardrop tattoo": "The teardrop tattoo or tear tattoo is a symbolic tattoo of a tear that is placed underneath the eye.The teardrop is one of the most widely recognised prison tattoos[1] and has various meanings..It can signify that the wearer has spent time in prison,[2][3] or more specifically that the wearer was raped while incarcerated and tattooed by the rapist as a \"property\" mark and for humiliation, since facial tattoos cannot be concealed.[4][5][6][7].The tattoo is sometimes worn by the female companions of prisoners in solidarity with their loved ones.[8] Amy Winehouse had a teardrop drawn on her face in eyeliner after her husband Blake entered the Pentonville prison hospital following a suspected drug overdose.[9].It can acknowledge the loss of a friend or family member: Basketball player Amar'e Stoudemire has had a teardrop tattoo since 2012 honouring his older brother Hazell Jr., who died in a car accident.[10].In West Coast gang culture (USA), the tattoo may signify that the wearer has killed someone[11][12]  and in some of those circles, the tattoo's meaning can change: an empty outline meaning the wearer attempted murder..Sometimes the exact meaning of the tattoo is known only by the wearer:[12][13].Portuguese footballer Ricardo Quaresma has never explained his teardrop tattoos.[14].Main pageContentsCurrent

is a north\u2013south U.S.Highway that runs 1,239 miles (1,994km) in the central United States.The highway's northern terminus is located at the Canadian border near Noyes, Minnesota, at a now-closed border crossing.From this point, the highway once continued farther north as Manitoba Highway 75.Its southern terminus is located at Interstate 30 (I-30) and I-45 in Dallas, Texas, where US 75 is known as North Central Expressway.[1].US75 was previously a cross-country route, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico at Galveston, Texas, but the entire segment south of Dallas has been decommissioned in favor of I-45; a cutoff section of town-to-town surface road having become Texas State Highway 75..The first freeway in Texas was a several-mile stretch of US75 (now I-45)\u2014The Gulf Freeway\u2014opened to Houston traffic on October 1, 1948.The stretch of US75 between I-30 and the Oklahoma state line has exits numbered consecutively from 1 to 75 (with occasional A and B designations), excluding 9-19.All other Texas freeways that have exit numbers are coordinated with mile markers..", "Lower Ninth Ward": "The Lower Ninth Ward is a neighborhood in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana.As the name implies, it is part of the 9th Ward of New Orleans.The Lower Ninth Ward is often thought of as the entire area within New Orleans downriver of the Industrial Canal; however, the City Planning Commission divides this area into the Lower Ninth Ward and Holy Cross neighborhoods..The term \"Lower\" refers to its location farther towards the mouth of the Mississippi River, downriver, \"down\" or \"below\" the rest of the city.The 9th Ward, like all wards of New Orleans, is a voting district.The 9th Ward was added as a voting district in 1852.[1] The Lower 9th Ward is composed of Ward 9 Districts 1, 2, 4, and 7 which make up the Holy Cross Area and Ward 9 Districts 3, 5, 6, and 8.Higher voting district numbers in the 9th Ward (8\u201327) are on the upriver side of the Industrial Canal.[2] The area came to international attention for its devastation in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005..Excluding the industrial and swamp areas north of the Florida Canal, the neighborhood of the Lower 9th Ward is about 1.25mi (2.01km) from east to west and 2mi (3.2km) from north to south.Three major avenues cross the developed portion of the neighborhood, each with bridges over the Industrial Canal.Closest to the River is St.Claude Avenue; about midway through the neighborhood is Claiborne Avenue; Florida Avenue crosses at the northern edge of the historically populated portion of the Lower 9th.Most major businesses serving the neighborhood are located on St.", "Moon": "The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite.It orbits at an average distance of 384400km (238900mi), about 30 times the planet's diameter.The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet.This results in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month.The Moon's gravitational pull\u2013 and to a lesser extent the Sun's\u2013 are the main drivers of the tides..The Moon is in geophysical terms a planetary-mass object or satellite planet.It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474km (2,159mi) about as wide as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons.The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field.It formed 4.51billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia..The lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains, impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like streaks and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria (\"seas\"), which are plains of cooled magma.These maria formed when large impacts on the far side of the Moon heated up low lying layers of its crust on the near side..The Moon is, beside when passing through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the Sun, but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its orbit, producing the lunar phases.[19] The Moon is the brightest celestial object in Earth's night sky.", "Ronald Reagan": "Ronald Wilson Reagan (/\u02c8re\u026a\u0261\u0259n/ RAY-g\u0259n; February 6, 1911\u2013 June 5, 2004) was an American politician and actor who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989.A member of the Republican Party, his presidency constituted the Reagan era, and he is considered one of the most prominent conservative figures in American history..Reagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and began to work as a sports broadcaster in Iowa.In 1937, he moved to California, and became a well-known film actor there.From 1947 to 1952, Reagan served as the president of the Screen Actors Guild.During the 1950s, he worked in television and spoke for General Electric.From 1959 to 1960, he again served as the Screen Actors Guild's president.In 1964, \"A Time for Choosing\" gave Reagan attention as a new conservative figure.He was elected governor of California in 1966.During his governorship, he raised taxes, turned the state budget deficit into a surplus, and cracked down harshly on university protests.After challenging and losing to incumbent president Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican presidential primaries, Reagan won the Republican nomination and then a landslide victory over incumbent Democratic president Jimmy Carter in the 1980 United States presidential election..In his first term, Reagan implemented \"Reaganomics\", which involved economic deregulation and cuts in both taxes and government spending during a period of stagflation.", "Tanakh": "The Hebrew Bible or Tanakh[a] (/t\u0251\u02d0\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0x/;[1] Hebrew: \u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b8\u05f4\u05da\u05b0\u200e T\u0101n\u0101\u1e35), also known in Hebrew as Miqra (/mi\u02d0\u02c8kr\u0251\u02d0/; Hebrew: \u05de\u05b4\u05e7\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u200e M\u012bqr\u0101\u02be\u200d), is the canonical collection of Hebrew scriptures, including the Torah, the Nevi'im, and the Ketuvim.Different branches of Judaism and Samaritanism have maintained different versions of the canon, including the 3rd-century BCE Septuagint text used in Second Temple Judaism, the Syriac Peshitta, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and most recently the 10th-century medieval Masoretic Text compiled by the Masoretes, currently used in Rabbinic Judaism.[2] The terms \"Hebrew Bible\" or \"Hebrew Canon\" are frequently confused with the Masoretic Text; however, this is a medieval version and one of several texts considered authoritative by different types of Judaism throughout history.[2] The current edition of the Masoretic Text is mostly in Biblical Hebrew, with a few passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel and Ezra, and the verse Jeremiah 10:11).[3].The authoritative form of the modern Hebrew Bible used in Rabbinic Judaism is the Masoretic Text (7th to 10th century CE), which consists of 24 books, divided into chapters and pesuqim (verses).The Hebrew Bible developed during the Second Temple Period, as the Jews decided which religious texts were of divine origin; the Masoretic Text, compiled by the Jewish scribes and scholars of the Early Middle Ages, comprises the Hebrew and Aramaic 24 books that they considered authoritative.[2].The Hellenized Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria produced a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible called \"the Septuagint\", that included books later identified as the Apocrypha, while the Samaritans produced their own edition of the Torah, the Samaritan Pentateuch; according to the Dutch\u2013Israeli biblical scholar and linguist Emanuel Tov, professor of Bible Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, both of these ancient editions of the Hebrew Bible differ significantly from the medieval Masoretic Text.[2].In addition to the Masoretic Text, modern biblical scholars seeking to understand the history of the Hebrew Bible use a range of sources.[4] These include the Septuagint, the Syriac language Peshitta translation, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls collection, and quotations from rabbinic manuscripts.These sources may be older than the Masoretic Text in some cases and often differ from it.[5] These differences have given rise to the theory that yet another text, an Urtext of the Hebrew Bible, once existed and is the source of the versions extant today.[6] However, such an Urtext has never been found, and which of the three commonly known versions (Septuagint, Masoretic Text, Samaritan Pentateuch) is closest to the Urtext is debated.[7].There are many similarities between the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament.The Protestant Old Testament has the same books as the Hebrew Bible, but the books are arranged in different orders.The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches include the Deuterocanonical books, which are not included in the Hebrew Bible.[8].Tanakh is an acronym, made from the first Hebrew letter of each of the Masoretic Text's three traditional divisions: Torah (literally 'Instruction' or 'Law'),[9] Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings)\u2014hence TaNaKh..The three-part division reflected in the acronym Tanakh is well attested in the rabbinic literature.[10] During that period, however, Tanakh was not used.", "Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R": "The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R is a 636cc class motorcycle in the Ninja sport bike series from the Japanese manufacturer Kawasaki.[1].It was introduced in 1995, and has been constantly updated throughout the years in response to new products from Honda, Suzuki, and Yamaha.The ZX series is what was known as the Ninja line of Kawasaki motorcycles in the 1980s and still carries the name today..Kawasaki introduced the ZX-6R in 1995 with very similar looks and features like the 1994 introduced ZX-9R, including the ram-air intake that had been developed by Kawasaki since the 1990 ZX-11 (ZZ-R1100).[2]  The first ZX-6R had a dry weight of 401.2lb (182.0kg), wet weight of 454lb (206kg), and was capable of accelerating 0 to 60mph (0 to 97km/h) in 3.6seconds..There was a major revamp of the ZX-6R in 1998 with the Launch of the G series.The G series saw no increase in displacement but power went from 100BHP to 108BHP thanks to the newly designed airbox.[citation needed] The fairing was revamped, but it retained a similar design for the headlight, air intakes and windscreen.In 2000, the first J series replaced the G, increasing power to 112BHP by increasing the compression ratio from 11.8:1 to 12.8:1.[citation needed] The J series sported a couple of modernisations including a 180 section rear tire, second headlight, uprated generator and stick coils (coil on plug) replacing the traditional coil with HT lead..With strong competition from Honda's CBR600F4i, Suzuki's GSX-R600, and Yamaha's YZF-R6, Kawasaki decided on an unusual move for the late 2002 models.They increased the capacity of the traditional 600cc (37cuin) motor to 636 cubic centimetres (38.8cuin) with the ZX-6R A1P.This version used the J series bodywork with the only notable differences being the \"636\" stickers on the fairing.For riders who needed bikes for displacement-restricted racing, Kawasaki also made available a limited production 599cc (36.6cuin) version, the Ninja ZX-6RR, but the 636cc (38.8cuin) ZX-6R would be their main mass production middleweight sport bike..In 2003, there were a number of changes to the ZX-6R, or ZX636 as it is often referred.", "List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots": "Assassination attempts and plots on the president of the United States have been numerous, ranging from the early 19th century to the 2010s.On January 30, 1835, Andrew Jackson was the first president to experience an assassination attempt when Richard Lawrence twice tried to shoot the seventh president in the East Portico of the Capitol after Jackson left a funeral held in the House of Representatives Chamber.The attempt failed when both of Lawrence's pistols allegedly misfired.[1].Four sitting presidents have been killed: Abraham Lincoln (1865, by John Wilkes Booth), James A.Garfield (1881, by Charles J.Guiteau), William McKinley (1901, by Leon Czolgosz), and John F.Kennedy (1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald).Additionally, two presidents have been injured in attempted assassinations: former president Theodore Roosevelt (1912, by John Flammang Schrank) and Ronald Reagan (1981, by John Hinckley Jr.).In all of these cases, the attacker's weapon was a firearm.This article lists assassination attempts on former presidents and presidents-elect, but not on those who had not yet been elected president..Many assassination attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, were motivated by a desire to change the policy of the American government.[2] Not all such attacks, however, had political reasons.Many other attackers had questionable mental stability, and a few were judged legally insane.", "Where the Red Fern Grows": "Where the Red Fern Grows is a 1961 children's novel by Wilson Rawls about a boy who buys and trains two Redbone Coonhounds for hunting.[1] It's a work of autobiographical fiction based on Rawls' own childhood in the Ozarks..A middle-aged man named Billy Colman rescues a redbone hound under attack by neighborhood dogs.He takes it home with him so that its wounds can heal.In light of this event, he has a flashback to when he was ten living in the Ozark Mountains..Young Billy wants nothing more than a pair of hounds for coon hunting.After seeing a magazine ad for coon hounds, he spends the next two years working odd jobs to earn the $50 he needs to buy two.They're delivered to Tahlequah, over 20 miles away.He decides to walk the distance.As he returns with the dogs, he sees a heart carved on a tree with the names \"Dan + Ann\" inside it and decides to name them Old Dan and Little Ann.With his grandfather's help, he teaches them to be very loyal to each other and him..The first night of hunting season, Billy promises Old Dan and Little Ann that if they tree a raccoon, he will do the rest.They do so in a huge sycamore tree, which he believes is far too large to chop down.", "Oklahoma": "Oklahoma (/\u02cco\u028akl\u0259\u02c8ho\u028am\u0259/ \u24d8;[6] Choctaw: Oklahumma, pronounced [oklah\u00f3mma];[7] Cherokee: \u13a3\u13a7\u13b3\u13b0\u13b9, Okalahoma, pronounced [\u00f2g\u00e0l\u00e0h\u01d2\u02d0m\u00e3\u0301])[8] is a state in the South Central region of the United States,[9] bordered by the state of Texas to the south and west, Kansas to the north, Missouri to the northeast, Arkansas to the east, New Mexico to the west, and Colorado to the northwest.Partially in the western extreme of the Upland South, it is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States.Its residents are known as Oklahomans and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City..The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla, 'people' and humma, which translates as 'red'.[10] Oklahoma is also known informally by its nickname, \"The Sooner State\", in reference to the Sooners, settlers who staked their claims in the Unassigned Lands before the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 authorized the Land Rush of 1889..The land now known as Oklahoma has been inhabited since at least the last ice age.The Southern Plains villagers and the Mississippian people inhabited the area between roughly 800 and 1500.The Southern Plains Panhandle culture developed in the Oklahoma Panhandle in western Oklahoma while the Caddoan Mississippian culture inhabited the eastern parts of the state and included the major settlement of Spiro Mounds.The area was also inhabited by the Wichita people, Tonkawa people, and Caddo people.Between 1300 and 1500, the Plains Apache migrated into the Southern Great Plains (now western Oklahoma).During the 1700s, the Comanche people, Kiowa people, Osage people, and Quapaw people migrated into the region..The first European contact with the region was the Spanish explorer Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado in 1541.However, the land was claimed by the Kingdom of France's Louisiana colony and included in the Louisiana Purchase to the United States in 1803.", "Redwall": "Redwall is a series of children's fantasy novels by British writer Brian Jacques, published from 1986 to 2011.[1][2] It is also the title of the first book of the series, published in 1986, as well as the name of the abbey featured in the book, and is the name of an animated TV series based on three of the novels (Redwall, Mattimeo, and Martin the Warrior), which first aired in 1999.The books are primarily aimed at adolescents.There have been 22 novels and two picture books published.The twenty-second, and final, novel, The Rogue Crew, was posthumously released on 3 May 2011, almost three months after Jacques' death on 5 February.[3].The series chronicles the adventures of the anthropomorphic animals inhabiting Redwall Abbey and the surrounding countryside of Mossflower Wood, including mice, moles, hares, badgers, and other woodland species.Frequently the peace-loving creatures of Mossflower are called upon to become warriors to defend themselves from marauding bands of \"vermin\" such as rats, weasels, and foxes..The novels in the series are set in many periods in the fictional history of Redwall and Mossflower; the chronological order of the stories is not the same as the order in which they were written, some taking place before the construction of Redwall Abbey itself or in far-flung locations beyond Mossflower.Some of the books focus on characters who, in other volumes, are legendary historical figures, such as The Legend of Luke.Because of the widely spaced storylines, very few characters are mentioned in more than one or two novels.One notable exception is Martin the Warrior, one of the founders of Redwall Abbey, whose adventures are chronicled in several of the novels and who is frequently mentioned as an icon of heroism who inspires later Redwall denizens, occasionally appearing to them as a spiritual vision..Despite the changing historical setting and absence of recurring characters, familiar character archetypes recur throughout the books, often characters in tribe-specific leadership roles, such the Badger Lords, the Skipper of Otters, or the shrew tribe leader \"Log-a-Log\".Other recurring elements include \"Dibbuns\" (the Redwall name for infant woodlanders) and detailed descriptions of food..", "Therm": "The therm (symbol, thm) is a non-SI unit of heat energy equal to 100,000 British thermal units (BTU),[1] and approximately 105megajoules, 29kilowatt-hours, 25200kilocalories and 25.2thermies.One therm is the energy content of approximately 100 cubic feet (2.83 cubic metres) of natural gas at standard temperature and pressure.However, the BTU is not standardised worldwide, with slightly different values in the EU, UK, and USA, meaning that the energy content of the therm also varies by territory..Natural gas meters measure volume and not energy content, and given that the energy density varies with the mix of hydrocarbons in the natural gas, a 'therm factor' is used by natural gas companies to convert the volume of gas used to its heat equivalent, usually being expressed in units of 'therms per CCF' (CCF is an abbreviation for 100 cubic feet).Higher than average concentration of ethane, propane or butane will increase the therm factor and the inclusion of non-flammable impurities, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen will reduce it.The Wobbe Index of a fuel gas is also sometimes used to quantify the amount of heat per unit volume burnt..A decatherm or dekatherm[5] (dth or Dth) is 10 therms, which is 1,000,000British thermal units or 1.055 GJ.[6][7] It is a combination of the prefix  for 10 (deca, often with the US spelling \"deka\") and the energy unit therm.There is some ambiguity, as \"decatherm\" uses the prefix \"d\" to mean 10, where in metric the prefix \"d\" means \"deci\" or one-tenth, and the prefix \"da\" means \"deca\", or 10, though decatherm may use a capital \"D\".The energy content of 1,000 cubic feet (28m3) natural gas measured at standard conditions is approximately equal to one dekatherm..This unit of energy is used primarily to measure natural gas.Natural gas is a mixture of gases containing approximately 80% methane (CH4) and its heating value varies from about or 10.1 to 11.4 kilowatt-hours per cubic metre (975 to 1,100Btu/cuft), depending on the mix of different gases in the gas stream.The volume of natural gas with heating value of one dekatherm is about 910 to 1,026 cubic feet (25.8 to 29.1m3).", "Bruce Jenner": "Caitlyn Marie Jenner (born William Bruce Jenner; October 28, 1949; known as Bruce Jenner until 2015) is an American media personality and former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete.[1].Jenner played college football for the Graceland Yellowjackets before incurring a knee injury that required surgery.Convinced by Olympic decathlete Jack Parker's coach, L.D.Weldon, to try the decathlon, Jenner had a six-year decathlon career, culminating in winning the men's decathlon event at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal,[2][3] setting a third successive world record and gaining fame as \"an all-American hero\".[4] Jenner established a career in television, film, writing, auto racing, business, and as a Playgirl cover model.[5].Jenner has six children with three successive wives\u2013Chrystie Crownover, Linda Thompson, and Kris Jenner\u2013and from 2007 to 2021 appeared on the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians with Kris, their daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, as well as Kris's other children from her previous marriage, Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob Kardashian..Jenner publicly came out as a trans woman in April 2015, announcing her new name in July of that year.[6] From 2015 to 2016, she starred in the reality television series I Am Cait, which focused on her gender transition.At the time of her coming out, she had been called the most famous trans woman in the world.[7][8] Jenner is a transgender rights activist,[9][10][11] although her views on transgender issues have been criticized by many other LGBTQ+ activists.[12][13].A member of the Republican Party, Jenner ran as a replacement candidate in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election.[14][15][16] The recall failed, and she only received one percent of the vote, finishing in 13th place among the candidates running to replace governor Gavin Newsom.[17] Six months after the election, Jenner was hired by Fox News as an on-air contributor.[18].Caitlyn Marie Jenner was born on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York, as William Bruce Jenner, and was known as Bruce until June 2015.[19] Her parents are Esther Ruth (n\u00e9e McGuire) and William Hugh Jenner, who was an arborist originally from New Brunswick, Canada.[20][21] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, and Welsh descent.[22] Her younger brother, Burt, was killed in a car accident in Canton, Connecticut, on November 30, 1976, shortly after Jenner's success at the Olympic Games.[23][24] As a child, Jenner was diagnosed with dyslexia.[25].Jenner attended Sleepy Hollow High School in Sleepy Hollow, New York, for her freshman and sophomore years[26][27] and Newtown High School in Newtown, Connecticut, for her junior and senior years, graduating in 1968.[28] Jenner earned a football scholarship and attended Graceland College (now Graceland University) in Lamoni, Iowa, but was forced to stop playing football because of a knee injury.[29] Recognizing Jenner's potential, Graceland track coach L.D.Weldon encouraged Jenner to switch to the decathlon.[30] Jenner debuted as a decathlete in 1970 in the Drake Relays decathlon in Des Moines, Iowa, finishing in fifth place.[31] Jenner graduated from Graceland College in 1973 with a degree in physical education.[32].At the 1972 U.S.Olympic Trials at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, Jenner was eleventh after the first day in the men's decathlon,[33] and climbed to fifth behind Steve Gough and Andrew Pettes with one event remaining on the Fourth of July.[34] Needing to make up a 19-second gap on Gough in the 1500 meters, Jenner qualified for the Olympic team by finishing first, 22 seconds ahead of the others.", "Escherichia coli": "Escherichia coli (/\u02cc\u025b\u0283\u0259\u02c8r\u026aki\u0259 \u02c8ko\u028ala\u026a/ ESH-\u0259-RIK-ee-\u0259 KOH-ly)[1][2] is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms.[3][4] Most E.coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes such as EPEC, and ETEC are pathogenic and can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for food contamination incidents that prompt product recalls.[5][6] Most strains are part of the normal microbiota of the gut and are harmless or even beneficial to humans (although these strains tend to be less studied than the pathogenic ones).[7] For example, some strains of E.coli benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2[8] or by preventing the colonization of the intestine by pathogenic bacteria.These mutually beneficial relationships between E.coli and humans are a type of mutualistic biological relationship \u2014 where both the humans and the E.coli are benefitting each other.[9][10] E.coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter.The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for three days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.[11].E.coli and other facultative anaerobes constitute about 0.1% of gut microbiota,[12] and fecal\u2013oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease.Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination.[13][14] A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E.coli which can survive for many days and grow outside a host.[15].", "Area code 217": "Area codes 217 and 447 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for much of the central part of the U.S.state of Illinois.The numbering plan area (NPA) includes the state capital, Springfield, and Champaign, Urbana, Decatur, Taylorville, Lincoln, Danville,  Effingham, Quincy, Rantoul, and Jacksonville.217 was one of the original North American area codes created in 1947 and 447 was added to the same area in 2021 to form an all-services overlay..In the original configuration of the first nationwide telephone numbering plan, the numbering plan area 217 included most of Metro East, the Illinois side of the St.Louis metropolitan area.In 1951, a slight boundary shift reassigned most of the southern portion of Metro East to area code 618, leaving the northern portion in 217.The only other significant change in boundaries was after September 1956,[1] when its northern portion (Peoria, Bloomington-Normal) was combined with part of the region of area code 815 to form a new numbering plan area with area code 309.[2].In 2006, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved an all-services overlay for the numbering plan area, adding new area code 447 in 2021.[3][4] As of March 27, 2021, new central office codes are available for activation by service providers.A permissive dialing period was in effect from August 29, 2020, to February 27, 2021, when ten-digit dialing for local calls became mandatory..Smaller municipalities in the numbering plan area are:.39\u00b052\u203200\u2033N 88\u00b057\u203200\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff39.8666667\u00b0N 88.95\u00b0W\ufeff / 39.8666667; -88.95.", "Ozone depletion": "Ozone depletion consists of two related events observed since the late 1970s: a steady lowering of about four percent in the total amount of ozone in Earth's atmosphere, and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone (the ozone layer) around Earth's polar regions.[1] The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole.There are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events in addition to these stratospheric events..The main causes of ozone depletion and the ozone hole are manufactured chemicals, especially manufactured halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCFCs, halons), referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS).[2] These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by turbulent mixing after being emitted from the surface, mixing much faster than the molecules can settle.[3] Once in the stratosphere, they release atoms from the halogen group through photodissociation, which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2).[4] Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halocarbons increased..Ozone depletion and the ozone hole have generated worldwide concern over increased cancer risks and other negative effects.The ozone layer prevents harmful wavelengths of ultraviolet (UVB) light from passing through the Earth's atmosphere.These wavelengths cause skin cancer, sunburn, permanent blindness, and cataracts,[5] which were projected to increase dramatically as a result of thinning ozone, as well as harming plants and animals.These concerns led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which bans the production of CFCs, halons, and other ozone-depleting chemicals.[6] Currently,[when?] scientists plan to develop new refrigerants to replace older ones.[7].The ban came into effect in 1989.Ozone levels stabilized by the mid-1990s and began to recover in the 2000s, as the shifting of the jet stream in the southern hemisphere towards the south pole has stopped and might even be reversing.[8] Recovery is projected to continue over the next century, and the ozone hole was expected to reach pre-1980 levels by around 2075.[9] In 2019, NASA reported that the ozone hole was the smallest ever since it was first discovered in 1982.[10][11].The Montreal Protocol is considered the most successful international environmental agreement to date.[12][13] Following the bans on ozone-depleting chemicals, the UN projects that under the current regulations the ozone layer will completely regenerate by 2045, thirty years earlier than previously predicted.[14].Three forms (or allotropes) of oxygen are involved in the ozone-oxygen cycle: oxygen atoms (O or atomic oxygen), oxygen gas (O2 or diatomic oxygen), and ozone gas (O3 or triatomic oxygen).[15] Ozone is formed in the stratosphere when oxygen gas molecules photodissociate after absorbing UVC photons.This converts a single O2 into two atomic oxygen radicals.", "Preamble to the United States Constitution": "The Preamble to the United States Constitution, beginning with the words We the People, is a brief introductory statement of the US Constitution's fundamental purposes and guiding principles.Courts have referred to it as reliable evidence of the Founding Fathers' intentions regarding the Constitution's meaning and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve..The preamble was mainly written by Gouverneur Morris, a Pennsylvania delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention held at Independence Hall in Philadelphia..We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence,[note 1] promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America..The Preamble was placed in the Constitution during the last days of the Constitutional Convention by the Committee on Style, which wrote its final draft, with Gouverneur Morris leading the effort.It was not proposed or discussed on the floor of the convention beforehand.The initial wording of the preamble did not refer to the people of the United States; rather, it referred to people of the various states, which was the norm..In earlier documents, including the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, the Articles of Confederation, and the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognizing American independence, the word \"people\" was not used, and the phrase the United States was followed immediately by a listing of the states, from north to south.[1]  The change was made out of necessity, as the Constitution provided that, whenever the popularly elected ratifying conventions of nine states gave their approval, it would go into effect for those nine, irrespective of whether any of the remaining states ratified.[2].The Preamble serves solely as an introduction and does not assign powers to the federal government,[3] nor does it provide specific limitations on government action.Due to the Preamble's limited nature, no court has ever used it as a decisive factor in case adjudication,[4] except as regards frivolous litigation.[5].The courts have shown interest in any clues they can find in the Preamble regarding the Constitution's meaning.[6] Courts have developed several techniques for interpreting the meaning of statutes and these are also used to interpret the Constitution.[7] As a result, the courts have said that interpretive techniques that focus on the exact text of a document[8] should be used in interpreting the meaning of the Constitution.Balanced against these techniques are those that focus more attention on broader efforts to discern the meaning of the document from more than just the wording;[9] the Preamble is also useful for these efforts to identify the \"spirit\" of the Constitution..", "Shot put": "The shot put is a track and field event involving \"putting\" (throwing) a heavy spherical ball\u2014the shot\u2014as far as possible.For men, the sport has been a part of the modern Olympics since their revival (1896), and women's competition began in 1948..Homer mentions competitions of rock throwing by soldiers during the siege of Troy but there is no record of any dead weights being thrown in Greek competitions.The first evidence for stone- or weight-throwing events were in the Scottish Highlands, and date back to approximately the first century.[1] In the 16th century King Henry VIII was noted for his prowess in court competitions of weight and hammer throwing.[2].The first events resembling the modern shot put likely occurred in the Middle Ages when soldiers held competitions in which they hurled cannonballs.Shot put competitions were first recorded in early 19th century Scotland, and were a part of the British Amateur Championships beginning in 1866.[3].Competitors take their throw from inside a marked circle 2.135 metres (7ft 0in) in diameter, with a \"toe board\" or \"stop board\" 10 centimetres (4in) high at the front of the circle.The distance thrown is measured from the inside of the circumference of the circle to the nearest mark made on the ground by the falling shot, with distances rounded down to the nearest centimetre under IAAF and WMA rules..The following rules (indoor and outdoor) must be adhered to for a legal throw:.Foul throws occur when an athlete:.At any time if the shot loses contact with the neck then it is technically an illegal put..The following are either obsolete or non-existent, but commonly believed rules within professional competition:[citation needed].", "Member states of the United Nations": "The member states of the United Nations comprise 193 sovereign states.The United Nations (UN) is the world's largest intergovernmental organization.All members have equal representation in the UN General Assembly.[3].The United Nations charter defines the rules for admission of member states.Membership is open to all peace-loving states which accept certain terms of the charter and are able to carry them out.New members must be recommended by the United Nations Security Council.In addition to the member states, the UN also invites non-member states to be observer states at the UN General Assembly..The criteria for admission of new members to the UN are established in Chapter II, Article 4 of the UN Charter:[4].A recommendation for admission from the Security Council requires affirmative votes from at least nine of the council's fifteen members, with none of the five permanent members using their veto power.The Security Council's recommendation must then be approved in the General Assembly by a two-thirds majority vote.[5].In principle, only sovereign states can become UN members,[citation needed] and currently, all UN members are sovereign states.Although five members were not sovereign when they joined the UN, they all subsequently became fully independent between 1946 and 1991.", "Eiffel Tower": "The Eiffel Tower (/\u02c8a\u026af\u0259l/ EYE-f\u0259l; French: Tour Eiffel [tu\u0281 \u025bf\u025bl] \u24d8) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889..Locally nicknamed \"La dame de fer\" (French for \"Iron Lady\"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair.Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3]  The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022.[4] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:[5] 6.91million people ascended it in 2015.It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site (\"Paris, Banks of the Seine\") in 1991.[6].The tower is 330 metres (1,083ft) tall,[7] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris.Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410ft) on each side.During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930.It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height.Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17ft).Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct..The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels.", "Ken Jennings": "Kenneth Wayne Jennings III[1] (born May 23, 1974) is an American game show host, author, and former game show contestant.He is the highest-earning American game show contestant, having won money on five different game shows, including $4,522,700 on the U.S.game show Jeopardy!.Since 2021, Jennings and Mayim Bialik have alternated as hosts of that show, as well as Celebrity Jeopardy!.[2][3] In 2023, Jennings received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Game Show for hosting Jeopardy!.[4].Jennings holds the record for the longest winning streak on Jeopardy! with 74 consecutive wins.He also holds the record for the highest average correct responses per game in Jeopardy! history (for those contestants with at least 300 correct responses) with 35.9 during his original run (no other contestant has exceeded 30)[5] and 33.1 overall, including tournaments and special events.[6] In 2004, Jennings won 74 consecutive Jeopardy! games before he was defeated by challenger Nancy Zerg in his 75th appearance.Jennings' total earnings on Jeopardy! are $4,522,700, consisting of: $2,520,700 over his 74 wins; a $2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance; a $500,000 second-place prize in the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions (2005); a $300,000 second-place prize in Jeopardy!'s IBM Challenge (2011), when he lost to the Watson computer but became the first person to beat third-place finisher Brad Rutter; a $100,000 second-place prize in the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades (2014); a $100,000 second-place prize (his share of his team's $300,000 prize) in the Jeopardy! All-Star Games (2019); and a $1,000,000 first-place prize in Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time (2020)..During his first run of Jeopardy! appearances, Jennings earned the record for the highest American game show winnings.His total was surpassed by Rutter, who defeated Jennings in the finals of the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions, adding $2 million to Rutter's existing Jeopardy! winnings.Jennings regained the record after appearances on several other game shows, culminating with his results on an October 2008 appearance on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, though Rutter retained the record for highest Jeopardy! winnings and once again passed Jennings' total after his victory in the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades tournament.In 2020, he once again faced off with and won against Rutter, as well as James Holzhauer, in a special primetime series, Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time.[7].After his success on Jeopardy!, Jennings wrote about his experience and explored American trivia history and culture in his book Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs, published in 2006..", "Canadian Football League": "The Canadian Football League (CFL; French: Ligue canadienne de football\u2014LCF) is a professional sports league in Canada.The CFL is the highest level of competition in Canadian football.The league consists of nine teams, each located in a city in Canada.They are divided into two divisions: four teams in the East Division and five teams in the West Division..As of 2023, it features a 21-week regular season in which each team plays 18 games with three bye weeks.This season traditionally runs from mid-June to early November.Following the regular season, six teams compete in the league's three-week playoffs, which culminate in the Grey Cup championship game in late November.The Grey Cup is one of Canada's largest annual sports and television events.[3].The CFL was officially named on January 19, 1958,[4] upon the merger between the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union or \"Big Four\" (founded in 1907) and the Western Interprovincial Football Union (founded in 1936).[5].Rugby football began to be played in Canada in the 1860s, and many of the first Canadian football teams played under the auspices of the Canadian Rugby Football Union (CRFU), founded in 1884.[6] The CRFU was reorganized as the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) in 1891, and served as an umbrella organization for several provincial and regional unions.The Grey Cup was donated by Governor General the Earl Grey in 1909 to the team winning the Senior Amateur Football Championship of Canada.By that time, the sport as played in Canada had diverged markedly from its rugby origins with the introduction of the Burnside rules, and started to become more similar to the American game..", "Antibody": "An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig),[1] is a large, Y-shaped protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses.The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called an antigen.[2][3] Each tip of the \"Y\" of an antibody contains a paratope (analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision.Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize it directly (for example, by blocking a part of a virus that is essential for its invasion)..To allow the immune system to recognize millions of different antigens, the antigen-binding sites at both tips of the antibody come in an equally wide variety..In contrast, the remainder of the antibody is relatively constant.In mammals, antibodies occur in a few variants, which define the antibody's class or isotype: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM..The constant region at the trunk of the antibody includes sites involved in interactions with other components of the immune system.The class hence determines the function triggered by an antibody after binding to an antigen, in addition to some structural features..Antibodies from different classes also differ in where they are released in the body and at what stage of an immune response..Together with B and T cells, antibodies comprise the most important part of the adaptive immune system..They occur in two forms: one that is attached to a B cell, and the other, a soluble form, that is unattached and found in extracellular fluids such as blood plasma..Initially, all antibodies are of the first form, attached to the surface of a B cell \u2013 these are then referred to as B-cell receptors (BCR)..", "Zodiac killer": "The Zodiac Killer[n 2] is the pseudonym of an unidentified serial killer[1] who operated in Northern California in the late 1960s.[n 1] The case has been described as the most famous unsolved murder case in American history.[2] It became a fixture of popular culture and has inspired numerous amateur detectives to attempt to solve it..The Zodiac murdered five known victims in the San Francisco Bay Area between December 1968 and October 1969, operating in rural, urban and suburban settings.He targeted young couples and a lone male cab driver.His known attacks took place in Benicia, Vallejo, unincorporated Napa County, and the city of San Francisco proper.Two of his wounded victims survived.The Zodiac claimed to have murdered 37 victims.He has been linked to several other cold cases, some in Southern California or outside the state..The Zodiac coined this name in a series of taunting letters and cards that he mailed to regional newspapers, in which he threatened killing sprees and bombings if they were not printed.Some of the letters included cryptograms, or ciphers, in which the killer claimed that he was collecting his victims as slaves for the afterlife.Of the four ciphers he produced, two remain unsolved, and one was cracked only in 2020.While many theories regarding the identity of the killer have been suggested, the only suspect authorities ever publicly named was Arthur Leigh Allen,[3] a former elementary school teacher and convicted sex offender who died in 1992..Although the Zodiac ceased written communications around 1974, the unusual nature of the case led to international interest that has been sustained throughout the years.[4] The San Francisco Police Department marked the case \"inactive\" in April 2004, but re-opened it at some point prior to March 2007.[5][6] The case also remains open in the city of Vallejo, as well as in Napa and Solano counties.[7] The California Department of Justice has maintained an open case file on the Zodiac murders since 1969.[8].", "Jennings, Louisiana": "Jennings is a city in, and the parish seat of, Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana, United States,[3] near Lake Charles.The population was 10,383 at the 2010 census, a small decline from the 2000 tabulation.[4].Jennings is the principal city of the Jennings Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Jefferson Davis Parish.It is also part of the larger Lake Charles-Jennings Combined Statistical Area.It is also part of the large, 22-parish Acadiana region of the state, with a large Francophone population, many descended from early Acadian settlers..For whom the town was named, Jennings McComb was an Irish contractor for the Southern Pacific Railroad.He built the Jennings depot on a divide peculiar to the southwest Louisiana.This became the center of new development based on the railroad.The first settler was recorded as A.D.McFarlain, who came in 1881 from St.Mary Parish and opened a store.", "Nanotechnology": "Nanotechnology was defined by the National Nanotechnology Initiative as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers (nm).At this scale, commonly known as the nanoscale, surface area and quantum mechanical effects become important in describing properties of matter.The definition of nanotechnology is inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with these special properties.It is therefore common to see the plural form \"nanotechnologies\" as well as \"nanoscale technologies\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size.[1] An earlier description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology.[2].Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage,[3][4] engineering,[5] microfabrication,[6] and molecular engineering.[7] The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly,[8] from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale..Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology.Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products.On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials,[9] and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios.These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted..The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by physicist Richard Feynman in his talk There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms..The term \"nano-technology\" was first used by Norio Taniguchi in 1974, though it was not widely known.Inspired by Feynman's concepts, K.", "Eastern Bloc": "The Eastern Bloc, also known as the Communist Bloc, the Socialist Bloc, and the Soviet Bloc, was the coalition of communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America under the power of the Soviet Union that existed during the Cold War (1947\u20131991).These states followed the ideology of Marxism\u2013Leninism, in opposition to the capitalist Western Bloc.The Eastern Bloc was often called the \"Second World\", whereas the term \"First World\" referred to the Western Bloc and \"Third World\" referred to the non-aligned countries that were mainly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America but notably also included former pre-1948 Soviet ally Yugoslavia, which was located in Europe..In Western Europe, the term Eastern Bloc generally referred to the USSR and Central and Eastern European countries in the Comecon (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania[a]).In Asia, the Eastern Bloc comprised Mongolia, Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchea, North Korea, South Yemen, Syria and China.[b][c] In the Americas, the countries aligned with the Soviet Union included Cuba from 1961 and for limited periods Nicaragua and Grenada.[1].The term Eastern Bloc was often used interchangeably with the term Second World.This broadest usage of the term would include not only Maoist China and Cambodia, but also short-lived Soviet satellites such as the Second East Turkestan Republic (1944\u20131949), the People's Republic of Azerbaijan (1945\u20131946) and the Republic of Mahabad (1946), as well as the Marxist\u2013Leninist states straddling the Second and Third Worlds before the end of the Cold War: the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (from 1967), the People's Republic of the Congo (from 1969), the People's Republic of Benin, the People's Republic of Angola and People's Republic of Mozambique from 1975, the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada from 1979 to 1983, the Derg/People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia from 1974, and the Somali Democratic Republic from 1969 until the Ogaden War in 1977.[2][3][4][5] Although not Marxist-Leninist, leadership of Ba'athist Syria officially regarded the country as part of the Socialist Bloc and established a close economic, military alliance with Soviet Union.[6][7].Many states were accused by the Western Bloc of being in the Eastern Bloc when they were actually part of the Non-Aligned Movement.The most limited definition of the Eastern Bloc would only include the Warsaw Pact states and the Mongolian People's Republic as former satellite states most dominated by the Soviet Union.Cuba's defiance of complete Soviet control was noteworthy enough that Cuba was sometimes excluded as a satellite state altogether, as it sometimes intervened in other Third World countries even when the Soviet Union opposed this.[1].Post-1991 usage of the term \"Eastern Bloc\" may be more limited in referring to the states forming the Warsaw Pact (1955\u20131991) and Mongolia (1924\u20131991), which are no longer communist states.[8][9] Sometimes they are more generally referred to as \"the countries of Eastern Europe under communism\",[10] excluding Mongolia, but including Yugoslavia and Albania which had both split with the Soviet Union by the 1960s.[11].Even though Yugoslavia was a socialist country, it was not a member of the COMECON or the Warsaw Pact.", "New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2009": "The 2009 New Jersey gubernatorial election took place on November 3, 2009.[2] Incumbent Democratic Governor Jon Corzine ran for a second term against Republican Chris Christie, Independent Christopher Daggett, and nine others, in addition to several write-in candidates.Christie won the election, with about 48.5 percent of the vote, to 44.9 percent for Corzine and 5.8 percent for Daggett.[3] He assumed office on January 19, 2010.This was the first election to fill the newly created office of lieutenant governor, with the candidates for governor choosing their running mates.Kim Guadagno, Christie's running mate, became New Jersey's first lieutenant governor following her inauguration..Christie won the largest margin for a non-incumbent Republican since 1969.He was the first Republican to carry Middlesex and Gloucester counties in a gubernatorial election since 1985.[4] The 2009 election was the only time since 1961 when Bergen County did not support the winner of the state's gubernatorial election.Chris Daggett's 5.8% of the vote was the best for a third party in a New Jersey gubernatorial election since 1913.This is the second and most recent time that a sitting governor of New Jersey lost a general election..Although Corzine was unpopular among independents and Republicans, he polled much more highly among registered Democrats.His three opponents were former Glen Ridge mayor Carl Bergmanson, who ran on a platform of fiscal discipline, governmental reform, and removing the tolls on the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and the Atlantic City Expressway; perennial candidate Jeff Boss; and businessman and former Congressional candidate Roger Bacon.A Quinnipiac poll conducted shortly before the primary and released on May 20, 2009, indicated that 65% of Democratic primary voters would vote for Corzine, with the other three candidates each receiving 4%\u20135%.Also, 62% of Democrats approved of him while 24% did not.[8].", "Health care in the United States": "Healthcare in the United States is largely provided by private sector healthcare facilities, and paid for by a combination of public programs, private insurance, and out-of-pocket payments.The U.S.is the only developed country without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of its population lacks health insurance.[1][2][3][4].The United States spends more on healthcare than any other country, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP.[1] However, this expenditure does not necessarily translate into better overall health outcomes compared to other developed nations.[5] Coverage varies widely across the population, with certain groups, such as the elderly and low-income individuals, receiving more comprehensive care through government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare..The U.S.healthcare system has been the subject of significant political debate and reform efforts, particularly in the areas of healthcare costs, insurance coverage, and the quality of care.Legislation such as the Affordable Care Act of 2010 has sought to address some of these issues, though challenges remain..Uninsured rates have fluctuated over time, and disparities in access to care exist based on factors such as income, race, and geographical location.[6][7][8][9] The private insurance model predominates, and employer-sponsored insurance is a common way for individuals to obtain coverage.[1][10][11] The complex nature of the system, as well as its high costs, has led to ongoing discussions about the future of healthcare in the United States..At the same time, the United States is a global leader in medical innovation, measured either in terms of revenue or the number of new drugs and devices introduced.[12][13] The Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity concluded that the United States dominates science & technology, which \"was on full display during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the U.S.government [delivered] coronavirus vaccines far faster than anyone had ever done before,\" but lags behind in fiscal sustainability, with \"[government] spending [...] growing at an unsustainable rate.\"[14].The healthcare system in the United States can be traced back to the Colonial Era.[15] Community-oriented care was typical, with families and neighbors providing assistance to the sick.[16][17].During the 19th century, the practice of medicine began to professionalize.", "Body water": "In physiology, body water is the water content of an animal body that is contained in the tissues, the blood, the bones and elsewhere.The percentages of body water contained in various fluid compartments add up to total body water (TBW).This water makes up a significant fraction of the human body, both by weight and by volume.Ensuring the right amount of body water is part of fluid balance, an aspect of homeostasis..By weight, the average adult human is approximately 60% water, and the average child is approximately 65% water.[1][2] There can be considerable variation in body water percentage based on a number of factors like age, health, water intake, weight, and sex.In a large study of adults of all ages and both sexes, the adult human body averaged ~65% water.However, this varied substantially by age, sex, and adiposity (amount of fat in body composition).The figure for water fraction by weight in this sample was found to be 58 \u00b18% water for males and 48 \u00b16% for females.[3] The body water constitutes as much as 75% of the body weight of a newborn infant, whereas some obese people are as little as 45% water by weight.[4] This is due to how fat tissue does not retain water as well as lean tissue.These statistical averages will vary with factors such as type of population, age of people sampled, number of people sampled, and methodology.So there is not, and cannot be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure..Most animal body water is contained in various body fluids.These include intracellular fluid; extracellular fluid; plasma; interstitial fluid; and transcellular fluid.[5]  Water is also contained inside organs, in gastrointestinal, cerebrospinal, peritoneal, and ocular fluids.", "Self-esteem": "Self-esteem is confidence in one's own worth, abilities, or morals.Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself (for example, \"I am loved\", \"I am worthy\") as well as emotional states, such as triumph, despair, pride, and shame.[1] Smith and Mackie define it by saying \"The self-concept is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it (see self).\"[2].The construct of self-esteem has been shown to be a desirable one in psychology, as it is associated with a variety of positive outcomes, such as academic achievement,[3][4] relationship satisfaction,[5] happiness,[6] and lower rates of criminal behavior.The benefits of high self-esteem are thought to include improved mental and physical health, and less anti-social behavior [7] while drawbacks of low self-esteem have been found to be anxiety, loneliness, and increased vulnerability to substance abuse.[8].Self-esteem can apply to a specific attribute or globally.Psychologists usually regard self-esteem as an enduring personality characteristic (trait self-esteem), though normal, short-term variations (state self-esteem) also exist.Synonyms or near-synonyms of self-esteem include: self-worth,[9] self-regard,[10] self-respect,[11][12] and self-integrity..The concept of self-esteem has its origins in the 18th century, first expressed in the writings of the Scottish enlightenment thinker David Hume.Hume posits that it is important to value and think well of oneself because it serves a motivational function that enables people to explore their full potential.[13][14].The identification of self-esteem as a distinct psychological construct has its origins in the work of philosopher and psychologist, William James.James identified multiple dimensions of the self, with two levels of hierarchy: processes of knowing (called the \"I-self\") and the resulting knowledge about the self (the \"Me-self\").The observation about the self and storage of those observations by the I-self creates three types of knowledge, which collectively account for the Me-self, according to James.", "Masonic Lodge": "A Masonic lodge, often termed a private lodge or constituent lodge, is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry.It is also commonly used as a term for a building in which such a unit meets.Every new lodge must be warranted or chartered by a Grand Lodge, but is subject to its direction only in enforcing the published constitution of the jurisdiction.By exception the three surviving lodges that formed the world's first known grand lodge in London (now merged into the United Grand Lodge of England) have the unique privilege to operate as time immemorial, i.e., without such warrant; only one other lodge operates without a warrant \u2013 the Grand Stewards' Lodge in London, although it is not also entitled to the \"time immemorial\" title.[note 1] A Freemason is generally entitled to visit any lodge in any jurisdiction (i.e., under any Grand Lodge) in amity with his own.In some jurisdictions this privilege is restricted to Master Masons (that is, Freemasons who have attained the Order's third degree).He is first usually required to check, and certify, the regularity of the relationship of the Lodge \u2013 and be able to satisfy that Lodge of his regularity of membership.Freemasons gather together as a Lodge to work the three basic Degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason..Technically, Freemasons meet as a lodge, not in a lodge.In this context, the word \"lodge\" refers to a local chapter of Freemasons, meeting as a body.However, the term is often misused to refer to the buildings or rooms that Masons meet in.Masonic premises are also sometimes referred to as temples (\"of Philosophy and the Arts\").In many countries Masonic centre or Masonic hall has now replaced these terms to avoid arousing prejudice and suspicion, or confusion with a religious building.", "Pilkington": "Pilkington is a glass-manufacturing company which is based in Lathom, Lancashire, United Kingdom.It includes several legal entities in the UK, and is a subsidiary of Japanese company Nippon Sheet Glass (NSG)..Prior to its acquisition by NSG in 2006, it was an independent company listed on the London Stock Exchange and for a time was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index..The company was founded in 1826 as a partnership between members of the Pilkington and Greenall families, based in St Helens, Lancashire (now Merseyside), England.[1] The venture used the trading name of St Helens Crown Glass Company.[2] On the departure from the partnership of the last Greenall in 1845, the firm became known as Pilkington Brothers.[3] In 1894, the business was incorporated under the Companies Act 1862 as Pilkington Brothers Limited.[4].Pilkington was floated as a public company on the London Stock Exchange in 1970.[5] It was for many years the biggest employer in the northwest industrial town.The distinctive blue-glass head office tower block on Alexandra Business Park, off Prescot Road, used as the firm's world HQ, and completed in 1964, still dominates the town's skyline..Between 1953 and 1957, Pilkington employees Alastair Pilkington (no family relation) and Kenneth Bickerstaff invented the float glass process, a revolutionary method of high-quality flat glass production by floating molten glass over a bath of molten tin, avoiding the costly need to grind and polish plate glass to make it clear.[2] Pilkington then allowed the Float Process to be used under licence by numerous manufacturers around the world..Pilkington, with its subsidiary Triplex Safety Glass, in which it gradually acquired a controlling interest, also became a major world supplier of toughened and laminated safety glass to the automotive, aerospace and building industries.[2].During the 1960s and 1970s, Pilkington used the flow of Float royalties to invest in float glass plants in several countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada and Sweden, and also to acquire major existing flat and safety glass producers and plants in the United States (Libbey Owens Ford), Germany and France..A Monopolies Commission report in 1967, concluded that Pilkington and Triplex operations were efficient and entrepreneurial and, despite their high share of the UK glass trade, operated in a manner suited to consumers' best interests.[2].A rank-and-file strike in 1970, sparked off by an error in wage packets, brought 8,000 workers out for nearly two months.The General and Municipal Workers Union and Trades Union Congress leadership failed to provide any support, as they were too closely bound to management and government circles, with the result that strike leaders were blacklisted.", "Quotation": "A quotation is the repetition of a sentence, phrase, or passage from speech or text that someone has said or written.[1] In oral speech, it is the representation of an utterance (i.e.of something that a speaker actually said) that is introduced by a quotative marker, such as a verb of saying.For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\".Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special prosody in addition to quotative markers.In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.[2] Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by citation to their original source; such statements are marked with (punctuated with) quotation marks..Quotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view.They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay..A quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a painting, scenes from a movie or sections from a musical composition..Quotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or author, to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.[3] Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.[4][5].Famous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.Of these, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations, The Yale Book of Quotations and The Macmillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.", "1877": "1877 (MDCCCLXXVII) was a common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendarand a common year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar, the 1877th year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 877th  year of the 2ndmillennium, the 77th  year of the

which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning.The fruit is a drupe (stonefruit) which is about 5mm (0.20in) in diameter (fresh and fully mature), dark red, and contains a stone which encloses a single pepper seed.Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit), or white pepper (ripe fruit seeds).[2].Black pepper is native to the Malabar Coast[3][4] of India, and the Malabar pepper is extensively cultivated there and in other tropical regions..Ground, dried, and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a traditional medicine.Black pepper is the world's most traded spice,[5] and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world.Its spiciness is due to the chemical compound piperine, which is a different kind of spicy from the capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers.It is ubiquitous in the Western world as a seasoning, and is often paired with salt and available on dining tables in shakers or mills..The word pepper derives from Old English pipor, Latin piper, and Greek: \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9.[6] The Greek likely derives from Dravidian pippali, meaning \"long pepper\".[7] Sanskrit pippali shares the same meaning.[6].In the 16th century, people began using pepper to also mean the New World chili pepper (genus Capsicum), which is not closely related.[6]:\u200a2b.Processed peppercorns come in a variety of colours, any one of which may be used in food preparation, especially common peppercorn sauce.[8].Black pepper is produced from the still-green, unripe drupe of the pepper plant.[2] The drupes are cooked briefly in hot water, both to clean them and to prepare them for drying.[9] The heat ruptures cell walls in the pepper, speeding the work of browning enzymes during drying.[9] The drupes dry in the sun or by machine for several days, during which the pepper skin around the seed shrinks and darkens into a thin, wrinkled black layer.", "Fire hydrant": "A fire hydrant, fireplug, or firecock (archaic)[1] is a connection point by which firefighters can tap into a water supply.It is a component of active fire protection.Underground fire hydrants have been used in Europe and Asia since at least the 18th century.Above-ground pillar-type hydrants are a 19th-century invention..The user attaches a hose to the fire hydrant, then opens a valve on the hydrant to provide a powerful flow of water, on the order of 350 kilopascals (51psi); this pressure varies according to region and depends on various factors (including the size and location of the attached water main).This user can attach this hose to a fire engine, which can use a powerful pump to boost the water pressure and possibly split it into multiple streams.One may connect the hose with a threaded connection, instantaneous \"quick connector\" or a Storz connector..A user should take care not to open or close a fire hydrant too quickly, as this can cause a water hammer, which can damage nearby pipes and equipment.The water inside a charged hose line causes it to be very heavy and high water pressure causes it to be stiff and unable to make a tight turn while pressurized.When a fire hydrant is unobstructed, this is not a problem, as there is enough room to adequately position the hose..Most fire hydrant valves are not designed to throttle the water flow; they are designed to be operated full-on or full-off.The valving arrangement of most dry-barrel hydrants is for the drain valve to be open at anything other than full operation.", "President of South Africa": "The president of South Africa is the head of state and head of government of the Republic of South Africa.The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the South African National Defence Force.Between 1961 and 1994, the office of head of state was the state presidency..The president is elected by the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, and is usually the leader of the largest party, which has been the African National Congress since the first multiracial election was held on 27 April 1994.The Constitution limits the president's time in office to two five-year terms.[2] The first president to be elected under the new constitution was Nelson Mandela.The incumbent is Cyril Ramaphosa, who was elected by the National Assembly on 15 February 2018 following the resignation of Jacob Zuma..Under the interim constitution (valid from 1994\u201396), there was a Government of National Unity, in which a member of Parliament (MP) from the largest opposition party was entitled to a position as deputy president.Along with Thabo Mbeki, the last apartheid president, F.W.de Klerk also served as deputy president, in his capacity as the leader of the National Party which was the second-largest party in the new Parliament.But De Klerk later resigned and went into opposition with his party.A voluntary coalition government continues to exist under the new constitution (adopted in 1996), although there have been no appointments of opposition politicians to the post of deputy president since..", "Special education": "Special education (known as special-needs education, aided education, good education, alternative provision, exceptional student education, special ed., SDC, or SPED) is the practice of educating students in a way that accommodates their individual differences, disabilities, and special needs.This involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures, adapted equipment and materials, and accessible settings.These interventions are designed to help individuals with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school and in their community, which may not be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education..Special education aims to provide accommodated education for disabled students such as learning disabilities, learning difficulties (such as dyslexia), communication disorders, emotional and behavioral disorders, physical disabilities (such as osteogenesis imperfecta, cerebral palsy, lissencephaly, Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, and muscular dystrophy), developmental disabilities (such as autism spectrum disorder, Pervasive developmental disorder, and intellectual disabilities) and other disabilities.[1] Disabled students are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching, the use of technology, a specifically adapted teaching area, a resource room, or a separate classroom..Some scholars[who?] of education may categorize gifted education under the umbrella of \"special education\", but this pedagogical approach is different from special education because of the students' capabilities.Intellectual giftedness is a difference in learning and can also benefit from specialized teaching techniques or different educational programs, but the term \"special education\" is generally used to specifically indicate instruction of disabled students..Whereas special education is designed specifically for students with learning disabilities, remedial education can be designed for any students, with or without special needs; the defining trait is simply that they have reached a point of unpreparedness, regardless of why.For example, if a person's education was disrupted, for example, by internal displacement during civil disorder or a war..In most developed countries, educators modify teaching methods and environments so that the maximum number of students are served in general education environments.[2][3][4][5][6] Integration can reduce social stigmas and improve academic achievement for many students.[7].The opposite of special education is general education, also known as mainstream education.General education is the standard curriculum presented without special teaching methods or supports.Sometimes special education classrooms and general special education classrooms mix.", "George Soros": "George Soros[a] HonFBA (born Gy\u00f6rgy Schwartz on August 12, 1930)[1][2] is a Hungarian-American[b] billionaire investor and philanthropist.[7][8] As of October2023[update], he had a net worth of US$6.7 billion,[9][10] having donated more than $32 billion to the Open Society Foundations,[11] of which $15 billion has already been distributed, representing 64% of his original fortune.Forbes called Soros the \"most generous giver\" (in terms of percentage of net worth).[12] He is a resident of New York.[13].Born in Budapest to a non-observant Jewish family, Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary and moved to the United Kingdom in 1947.He studied at the London School of Economics and was awarded a BSc in philosophy in 1951, and then a Master of Science degree, also in philosophy, in 1954.[14][15][16].Soros started his career working in British and American merchant banks, before setting up his first hedge fund, Double Eagle, in 1969.Profits from this fund provided the seed money for Soros Fund Management, his second hedge fund, in 1970.Double Eagle was renamed Quantum Fund and was the principal firm Soros advised.At its founding, Quantum Fund had $12 million in assets under management, and as of 2011[update] it had $25 billion, the majority of Soros's overall net worth.[17].Soros is known as \"The Man Who Broke the Bank of England\" as a result of his short sale of US$10 billion worth of pounds sterling, which made him a profit of $1billion, during the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis.[18] Based on his early studies of philosophy, Soros formulated the General Theory of Reflexivity for capital markets, to provide insights into asset bubbles and fundamental/market value of securities, as well as value discrepancies used for shorting and swapping stocks.[19].Soros supports progressive and liberal political causes, to which he dispenses donations through the Open Society Foundations.[20] Between 1979 and 2011, he donated more than $11billion to various philanthropic causes;[21][22] by 2017, his donations \"on civil initiatives to reduce poverty and increase transparency, and on scholarships and universities around the world\" totaled $12 billion.[23] He influenced the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s,[24] and provided one of Europe's largest higher education endowments to the Central European University in his Hungarian hometown.[25].Soros's extensive funding of political causes has made him a \"bugaboo of European nationalists\".[26] In 2018, The New York Times reported that \"conspiracy theories about him have gone mainstream, to nearly every corner of the Republican Party\".[27] Numerous far-right theorists have promoted false claims that characterize Soros as a dangerous \"puppet master\" behind alleged global plots.[27][28][29] Criticisms of Soros, who is of Jewish descent, have often been called antisemitic.[30][31][32].Gy\u00f6rgy Schwartz was born on 12 August 1930 in Budapest in the Kingdom of Hungary to a prosperous non-observant Jewish family, who, like many upper-middle class Hungarian Jews at the time, were uncomfortable with their roots.", "Invention of the telephone": "The invention of the telephone was the culmination of work done by more than one individual, and led to an array of lawsuits relating to the patent claims of several individuals and numerous companies..The concept of the telephone dates back to the string telephone or lover's telephone that has been known for centuries, comprising two diaphragms connected by a taut string or wire.Sound waves are carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other.The classic example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, paper cups or similar items.The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the voice sounds for reproduction at a distance.One precursor to the development of the electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices.Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.[1].In 1840, American Charles Grafton Page passed an electric current through a coil of wire placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet.He observed that connecting and disconnecting the current caused a ringing sound in the magnet.He called this effect \"galvanic music\".[2].Innocenzo Manzetti considered the idea of a telephone as early as 1844, and may have made one in 1864, as an enhancement to an automaton built by him in 1849..Charles Bourseul was a French telegraph engineer who proposed (but did not build) the first design of a \"make-and-break\" telephone in 1854.", "Master of Fine Arts": "A Master of Fine Arts (MFA or M.F.A.)[1][2][3][4].is a terminal degree in fine arts, including visual arts, creative writing, graphic design, photography, filmmaking, dance, theatre, other performing arts and in some cases, theatre management[5][6][7] or arts administration.[8].It is a graduate degree that typically requires two to three years of postgraduate study after a bachelor's degree, though the term of study varies by country or university.Coursework is primarily of an applied or performing nature, with the program often culminating in a thesis exhibition or performance.The first university to admit students to the degree of Master of Fine Arts was the University of Iowa in 1940.[9].A candidate for an MFA typically holds a bachelor's degree prior to admission, but many institutions do not require that the candidate's undergraduate major conform with their proposed path of study in the MFA program.Admissions requirements often consist of a sample portfolio of artworks or a performance audition.[10][11][12][13].The Master of Fine Arts differs from the Master of Arts in that the MFA, while still an academic program, centers-on professional artistic practice in the particular field, whereas programs leading to the MA usually center on the scholarly, academic, or critical study of the field.Additionally, in the United States, an MFA is typically recognized as a terminal degree for practitioners of visual art, design, dance, photography, theatre, film/video, new media, and creative writing\u2014meaning that it is considered the highest degree in its field, qualifying an individual to become a professor at the university level in these disciplines..Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate.HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent

cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively.The bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.Japan surrendered to the Allies on 15 August, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan and invasion of Japanese-occupied Manchuria.The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on 2 September, effectively ending the war..In the final year of World War II, the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of the Japanese mainland.This undertaking was preceded by a conventional bombing and firebombing campaign that devastated 64 Japanese cities.The war in the European theatre concluded when Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific War.By July 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs: \"Little Boy\", an enriched uranium gun-type fission weapon, and \"Fat Man\", a plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon.The 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces was trained and equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, and deployed to Tinian in the Mariana Islands.The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945, the alternative being \"prompt and utter destruction\".The Japanese government ignored the ultimatum..", "Mahatma Gandhi": "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869\u2013 30 January 1948)  was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule.He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.The honorific Mah\u0101tm\u0101 (from Sanskrit'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world..Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891.After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit.He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years.It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights.In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination..Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule.Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor.He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest.Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400km (250mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942.", "Joan Crawford": "Joan Crawford (born Lucille Fay LeSueur; March 23, 190?[Note 1]\u2013 May 10, 1977) was an American actress.She started her career as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting on Broadway.Crawford was signed to a motion picture contract by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925.Initially frustrated by the size and quality of her parts, Crawford launched a publicity campaign and built an image as a nationally known flapper by the end of the 1920s.By the 1930s, Crawford's fame rivaled MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo.Crawford often played hardworking young women who find romance and financial success.These \"rags-to-riches\" stories were well received by Depression-era audiences and were popular with women.Crawford became one of Hollywood's most prominent movie stars and one of the highest paid women in the United States, but her films began losing money.By the end of the 1930s, she was labeled \"box office poison\"..After an absence of nearly two years from the screen, Crawford staged a comeback by starring in Mildred Pierce (1945), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.In 1955, she became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company, through her marriage to company president Alfred Steele.After his death in 1959, Crawford was elected to fill his vacancy on the board of directors but was forcibly retired in 1973.", "Tonneau": "A tonneau (US: /t\u028c\u02c8no\u028a/ or UK: /\u02c8t\u0252no\u028a/) is an area of a car or truck open at the top.It can be for passengers or cargo..A tonneau cover in current automotive terminology is a hard or soft cover that spans the back of a pickup truck to protect the load from weather elements, thieves or to improve aerodynamics.Tonneau covers come in many styles that fold, retract, or tilt open, and can be locked shut.Common materials used include steel, aluminium, canvas, PVC, fibreglass, and carbon fibre..Tonneau covers are also used to cover and protect open areas of boats.Many of these covers are made of waterproofed canvas and are held in place by snaps..The older, original tonneau covers were used to protect unoccupied passenger seats in convertibles and roadsters, and the cargo bed of a pickup truck or coup\u00e9 utility.Hard tonneau covers open by a hinging or folding mechanism while segmented or soft covers open by rolling up or folding.Among them, hard folding covers are more popular to truck owners as they offer better protection, and waterproofness.[1].Truck and car tonneau covers keep items out of the sun and out of the sight of potential thieves.[2].A tonneau was originally an open rear passenger compartment, rounded like a barrel,[3] on an automobile and, by extension, a body style incorporating such a compartment.", "Twitter": "X,[b] formerly called Twitter,[c] is an online social media and social networking service operated by the American company X Corp., the successor of Twitter, Inc.On X, registered users can post text, images and videos.[13] Users can also \"like\", repost, quote repost, comment on posts, direct message, video and audio call, bookmark, join lists and communities, and join public Spaces with other registered users.Approved contributors can also leave Community Notes to add context to posts by other registered users.Posting information to the site is often referred to as tweeting, retweeting and quote tweeting.Although the service was renamed to \"X\", its primary website address remains twitter.com as of November 2023[update], with the x.com domain name redirecting to that address..Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams.It was launched in July of that year.Its parent company, Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California and had more than 25 offices around the world.[14] By 2012[update], more than 100 million users produced 340 million tweets a day,[15] and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day.[16][17][15] In 2013, it was one of the world's ten most-visited websites.[citation needed] By the start of 2019[update], Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users.[18] In practice, the vast majority of tweets are produced by a minority of users.[19][20] In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were not genuine people.[21] As of October 2023, Twitter is the 5th most-visited website in the world with 23.6% of its traffic coming from the United States followed by Japan at 15.94% and the United Kingdom at 5.57% according to data provided by Similarweb.[22][23].In October 2022, billionaire Elon Musk acquired Twitter for US$44 billion, gaining control of the platform and becoming CEO.[24][25][26][27] Since the acquisition, the platform has been criticized for the spread of misinformation and disinformation,[28][29][30] facilitating an increase in hate speech,[31][32][33] promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories[34][35] and transphobia.[36][37].Linda Yaccarino succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as Chairman and CTO.[10][38][39] In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to X and that the bird logo would be retired.[40][41] In October 2023, the company estimated its value at about $19 billion, down about 55% from the purchase price one year earlier.[42] Fidelity at about the same time estimated the value to be down 65% from its purchase price.[43].Twitter's origins lie in a \"daylong brainstorming session\" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo.Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.[44][45] The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[46] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes.", "The Hangover": "The Hangover is a 2009 American comedy film directed by Todd Phillips and written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore.It is the first installment in The Hangover trilogy.The film stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Heather Graham, Justin Bartha, Ken Jeong, and Jeffrey Tambor.It tells the story of Phil Wenneck (Cooper), Stu Price (Helms), Alan Garner (Galifianakis), and Doug Billings (Bartha), who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party to celebrate Doug's impending marriage.However, Phil, Stu, and Alan wake up with Doug missing and no memory of the previous night's events, and must find the groom before the wedding can take place..Lucas and Moore wrote the script after executive producer Chris Bender's friend disappeared and had a large bill after being sent to a strip club.After Lucas and Moore sold it to the studio for $2million, Phillips and Jeremy Garelick rewrote the script to include a tiger as well as a subplot involving a baby and a police cruiser, and also including boxer Mike Tyson.Filming took place in Nevada for 15 days, and during filming, the three main actors (Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis) formed a real friendship..The Hangover was released on June 5, 2009,[4] and was a critical and commercial success.The film became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2009, with a worldwide gross of over $467million.The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, and received multiple other accolades.It became the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever in the United States, surpassing a record previously held by Beverly Hills Cop for almost 25 years.[5].", "Meiosis": "Meiosis (/ma\u026a\u02c8o\u028as\u026as/ \u24d8; from Ancient Greek  \u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (me\u00ed\u014dsis)'lessening', since it is a reductional division)[1][2] is a special type of cell division of germ cells in sexually-reproducing organisms that produces the gametes, such as sperm or egg cells.It involves two rounds of division that ultimately result in four cells with only one copy of each chromosome (haploid).Additionally, prior to the division, genetic material from the paternal and maternal copies of each chromosome is crossed over, creating new combinations of code on each chromosome.[3] Later on, during fertilisation, the haploid cells produced by meiosis from a male and a female will fuse to create a cell with two copies of each chromosome again, the zygote..Errors in meiosis resulting in aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes) are the leading known cause of miscarriage and the most frequent genetic cause of developmental disabilities.[4].In meiosis, DNA replication is followed by two rounds of cell division to produce four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the original parent cell.[3] The two meiotic divisions are known as meiosis I and meiosis II.Before meiosis begins, during S phase of the cell cycle, the DNA of each chromosome is replicated so that it consists of two identical sister chromatids, which remain held together through sister chromatid cohesion.This S-phase can be referred to as \"premeiotic S-phase\" or \"meiotic S-phase\".Immediately following DNA replication, meiotic cells enter a prolonged G2-like stage known as meiotic prophase.During this time, homologous chromosomes pair with each other and undergo genetic recombination, a programmed process in which DNA may be cut and then repaired, which allows them to exchange some of their genetic information.A subset of recombination events results in crossovers, which create physical links known as chiasmata (singular: chiasma, for the Greek letter Chi (\u03a7)) between the homologous chromosomes.In most organisms, these links can help direct each pair of homologous chromosomes to segregate away from each other during meiosis I, resulting in two haploid cells that have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell..During meiosis II, the cohesion between sister chromatids is released and they segregate from one another, as during mitosis.", "Boxing": "Boxing (also known as \"western boxing\" or \"pugilism\") is a combat sport and a martial art[1] in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring..Although the term boxing is commonly attributed to Western boxing, in which only fists are involved, it has developed in different ways in different geographical areas and cultures of the World.In global terms, \"boxing\" today is also a set of combat sports focused on striking, in which two opponents face each other in a fight using at least their fists, and possibly involving other actions such as kicks, elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules.Some of these variants are the bare knuckle boxing, kickboxing, muay-thai, lethwei, savate, and sanda.[2][3] Boxing techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts, military systems, and other combat sports..Humans have engaged in hand-to-hand combat since the earliest days of human history.The origins of boxing as a sport remain uncertain[4], but some sources suggest it has prehistoric roots in what is now Ethiopia, emerging as early as the sixth millennium BC.It is believed that when the Egyptians invaded Nubia, they adopted boxing from the local populace, subsequently popularizing it in Egypt.From there, the sport of boxing spread to various regions, including Greece, eastward to Mesopotamia, and northward to Rome.[5].The earliest visual evidence of any type of boxing is from Egypt and Sumer both from the third millennia[6] and can be seen in Sumerian carvings from the third and second millennia BC.[7][8][9][10] The earliest evidence of boxing rules dates back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC.[7] Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules..Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games\u2014it also has its world championships.Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called \"rounds\"..A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualifies an opponent, or the opponent resigns.", "Agreement (linguistics)": "In linguistics, agreement or concord (abbreviated agr) occurs when a word changes form depending on the other words to which it relates.[1] It is an instance of inflection, and usually involves making the value of some grammatical category (such as gender or person) \"agree\" between varied words or parts of the sentence..For example, in Standard English, one may say I am or he is, but not \"I is\" or \"he am\".This is because English grammar requires that the verb and its subject agree in person.The pronouns I and he are first and third person respectively, as are the verb forms am and is.The verb form must be selected so that it has the same person as the subject in contrast to notional agreement, which is based on meaning.[2][3].Agreement generally involves matching the value of some grammatical category between different constituents of a sentence (or sometimes between sentences, as in some cases where a pronoun is required to agree with its antecedent or referent).Some categories that commonly trigger grammatical agreement are noted below..Agreement based on grammatical person is found mostly between verb and subject.An example from English (I am vs.he is) has been given in the introduction to this article..Agreement between pronoun (or corresponding possessive adjective) and antecedent also requires the selection of the correct person.For example, if the antecedent is the first person noun phrase Mary and I, then a first person pronoun (we/us/our) is required; however, most noun phrases (the dog, my cats, Jack and Jill, etc.) are third person, and are replaced by a third person pronoun (he/she/it/they etc.)..", "List of places on land with elevations below sea level": "This is a list of places on land below mean sea level..Places artificially created such as tunnels, mines, basements, and dug holes, or places under water, or existing temporarily as a result of ebbing of sea tide etc., are not included.Places where seawater and rainwater is pumped away are included.Fully natural places below sea level require a dry

and contemporary women's fiction.Six of her novels have become made-for-TV movies and her Cedar Cove series of novels was adapted into a television series of the same name.[1] Macomber was the inaugural winner of the fan-voted Quill Award for romance in 2005[2] and has been awarded both a RITA Award and a lifetime achievement award by the Romance Writers of America.[3].She also works as executive producer on the television adaptations of her books..Macomber is dyslexic and has only a high school education.Determined to be a writer,[4] she sat in her kitchen in front of a rented typewriter to develop her first few manuscripts, while raising four children.[5] After five years and many rejections from publishers, she turned to freelance magazine work.[4].Macomber attended a romance writer's conference, where one of her manuscripts was selected to be publicly critiqued by an editor from Harlequin.The editor tore apart her novel and recommended that she throw it away.Undaunted, Macomber spent $10 to mail the same novel, Heartsong, to Harlequin's rival, Silhouette Books.Silhouette bought the book, which became the first romance novel to be reviewed by Publishers Weekly.[4].Starlight was the first of her novels to be published, as part of the Silhouette Special Edition romance line.[6] Macomber continued to write romances for Silhouette, and later Harlequin.In 1988, Harlequin asked Macomber to write a series of interconnected stories, which became known as the Navy series.Before long, she was releasing two or three titles per year.", "Catonsville, Maryland": "Catonsville (/\u02c8ke\u026at\u0259nz\u02ccv\u026al/) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Baltimore County, Maryland.The population was 44,701 at the 2020 US Census.The community is a streetcar suburb of Baltimore along the city's western border.The town is known for its proximity to the Patapsco River and Patapsco Valley State Park, making it a regional mountain biking hub.The town is also notable as a local hotbed of music, earning it the official nickname of \"Music City, Maryland.\"[4] Catonsville contains the majority of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), a major public research university with close to 14,000 students..Before European colonists settled in present-day Catonsville, the area was occupied by the Piscataway tribe[5] or the Susquehannocks.[6].Rolling Road was used to transport tobacco south from plantations to the Patapsco River on horse-drawn wagons..In 1787, the Ellicott family built the Frederick Turnpike to transport goods from their flour mill, Ellicott Mills, to the Baltimore harbor.Charles Carroll, the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence at the time, owned the land around the then newly built road.He instructed his son-in-law, Richard Caton, to develop the area along the road.Caton and his wife, Mary Carroll Caton, lived in Castle Thunder, constructed on the Frederick Turnpike in 1787.[7].Caton gave his name to the community and called it \"Catonville,\" although the name was changed to \"Catonsville\" in the 1830s.", "Lawyer": "A lawyer is a person who practices law.The role of a lawyer varies greatly across different legal jurisdictions.A lawyer can be classified as an advocate, government lawyer, attorney, barrister, canon lawyer, civil law notary, counsel, counselor, solicitor, legal executive, or public servant \u2014 with each role having different functions and privileges.[1] Working as a lawyer generally involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific problems.Some lawyers also work primarily in advancing the interests of the law and legal profession.[2][3].Different legal jurisdictions have different requirements in the determination of who is recognized as a lawyer.As a result, the meaning of the term \"lawyer\" may vary from place to place..Some jurisdictions have two types of lawyers, barrister and solicitors, while others fuse the two.A barrister (also known as an advocate or counselor in some jurisdictions) is a lawyer who typically specializes in arguing before courts, particularly in higher courts.A solicitor (or attorney) is a lawyer who is trained to prepare cases and give advice on legal subjects.Depending on jurisdiction, solicitors can also represent people in lower courts but do not ordinarily have rights of audience in higher courts.Both solicitors and barristers are trained in law.However, in jurisdictions where there is a split profession, only barristers are admitted as members of a bar association..", "Vector Marketing": "Vector Marketing is a direct selling subsidiary company and the domestic sales arm of Cutco Corporation, an Olean, New York\u2013based cutlery manufacturer.The company was founded in 1981 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania..The company sells via individual sales representatives who sell Cutco cutlery via one-on-one demonstrations, typically through home visits.The company has been the subject of criticism and lawsuits for its business practices, and has been accused of being a multi-level marketing company.Salespeople are generally young and recruited from high school or college; Vector's recruitment tactics have been described as deceptive, and they have faced numerous lawsuits over their pay structure and treatment of its salespeople, who are mostly independent contractors instead of employees.Vector claims they are a single-level direct selling marketing company, not a multi-level marketing company or a pyramid scheme as its detractors claim..Vector Marketing Corporation was founded in 1981 by Don Freda in Glenolden, Pennsylvania, as an independent seller of Cutco Cutlery products manufactured by the Alcas Corporation.[1][2] It quickly became one of the top sellers of Cutco products, and in 1985, it was acquired by Alcas, which was struggling with sales following their split from former parent company Alcoa in 1983.[2][1].In 2009, Alcas changed its name to Cutco Corporation, with Vector its domestic sales subsidiary.[3].In 2019, Vector Marketing reported $273.8million in sales.[4].Vector Marketing is a direct selling company that has built its sales force through advertising via newspapers, word-of-mouth, posted advertisements, letters and various media on the internet.[5][6][7][8] The Los Angeles Times claims that Vector meets the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) definition of a multi-level marketing company because they sell their product through person-to-person sales, but Vector argues that they employ single-level marketing and don't meet the FTC definition of \"businesses that involve selling products to family and friends and recruiting other people to do the same\"[9] because higher-level employees don't profit from the revenue of people they recruit.[10][11] While the company has paid millions of dollars in lawsuits alleging deceptive recruiting practices, since it does actually sell a product, it is not a pyramid scheme.[11].The company recruits sales representatives from high schools and college campuses in the United States and Canada, sometimes through misrepresentation of affiliation with the school.[12][13] Sales representatives are employed as independent contractors to sell Cutco products (mainly kitchen knives) to customers, typically their friends and family members, via one-on-one demonstrations.[13][14].Some of Vector's former independent contractors have accused Vector Marketing of deceptive business practices.[15][16] The firm frequently advertises in newspapers and on fliers posted on bulletin boards at college campuses, but the advertisements are often vague without explaining the nature of the job.[17] The LA Times advised caution to potential employees, who are often young and never had a job before.", "Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993": "The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) is a United States labor law requiring covered employers to provide employees with job-protected, unpaid leave for qualified medical and family reasons.[1] The FMLA was a major part of President Bill Clinton's first-term domestic agenda, and he signed it into law on February 5, 1993.The FMLA is administered by the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor..The FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to care for a new child, care for a seriously ill family member, or recover from a serious illness.The FMLA covers both public- and private-sector employees, but certain categories of employees, including elected officials and highly compensated employees, are excluded from the law or face certain limitations.In order to be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work for an employer with at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius.Several states have passed laws providing additional family and medical leave protections for workers..Prior to the 1992 presidential election, a family medical leave act had been vetoed twice by President George H.W.Bush.[2] After Bill Clinton won the 1992 election, a law protecting family medical leave became one of his major first-term domestic priorities.Rapid growth in the workforce, including a large number of women joining, suggested a necessary federal regulation that would support the working class who desired to raise a family and/or required time off for illness-related situations.[3] President Clinton signed the bill into law on February 5, 1993 (codified under Pub.L.Tooltip Public Law (United States)103\u20133, 29U.S.C.\u00a72601, and 29CFR 825) with the enforcement of the bill to start six months later on August 5, 1993..The United States Congress passed the Act with the understanding that \u201cit is important for the development of children and the family unit that fathers and mothers be able to participate in early childrearing \u2026 [and] the lack of employment policies to accommodate working parents can force individuals to choose between job security and parenting\u201d.[4] It also stressed the Act was intended to provide leave protection for individuals \u201cin a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers\u201d.[5].", "Vietnam War": "North Vietnamese and Viet Cong/PRG victory.Total military dead/missing:\u22481,100,000Total military wounded:\u2248604,200(excluding GRUNK/Khmer Rouge and Pathet Lao).Tet Offensive and aftermath.Post-Paris Peace Accords (1973\u20131974).Lists of allied operations.The Vietnam War (also known by other names) was a conflict in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955[A 1] to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was a major conflict of the Cold War.While the war was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam, the north was supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist states, while the south was supported by the United States and other anti-communist allies, making the war a proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union.It lasted almost 20 years, with direct U.S.military involvement ending in 1973.The conflict also spilled over into neighboring states, exacerbating the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War, which ended with all three countries officially becoming communist states by 1976..After the fall of French Indochina with the 1954 Geneva Conference on 21 July, the country gained independence from France but was divided into two parts: the Viet Minh took control of North Vietnam, while the U.S.", "Pothole": "A pothole is a depression in a road surface, usually asphalt pavement, where traffic has removed broken pieces of the pavement.It is usually the result of water in the underlying soil structure and traffic passing over the affected area.Water first weakens the underlying soil; traffic then fatigues and breaks the poorly supported asphalt surface in the affected area.Continued traffic action ejects both asphalt and the underlying soil material to create a hole in the pavement.[1].According to the US Army Corps of Engineers's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, pothole formation requires two factors to be present at the same time: water and traffic.Water weakens the soil beneath the pavement while traffic applies the loads that stress the pavement past the breaking point.Potholes form progressively from fatigue of the road surface which can lead to a precursor failure pattern known as crocodile (or alligator) cracking.[2] Eventually, chunks of pavement between the fatigue cracks gradually work loose, and may then be plucked or forced out of the surface by continued wheel loads to create a pothole.[3].In areas subject to freezing and thawing, frost heaving can damage a pavement and create openings for water to enter.In the spring, thaw of pavements accelerates this process when the thawing of upper portions of the soil structure in a pavement cannot drain past still-frozen lower layers, thus saturating the supporting soil and weakening it.[3].Potholes can grow to several feet in width, though they usually only develop to depths of a few inches.If they become large enough, damage to tires, wheels, and vehicle suspensions is liable to occur.Serious road accidents can occur as a direct result, especially on those roads where vehicle speeds are greater.[3].", "Renal cell carcinoma": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine.RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 90\u201395% of cases.[1] RCC occurrence shows a male predominance over women with a ratio of 1.5:1.RCC most commonly occurs between 6th and 7th decade of life.[2].Initial treatment is most commonly either partial or complete removal of the affected kidney(s).[3] Where the cancer has not metastasised (spread to other organs) or burrowed deeper into the tissues of the kidney, the five-year survival rate is 65\u201390%,[4] but this is lowered considerably when the cancer has spread..The body is remarkably good at hiding the symptoms and as a result people with RCC often have advanced disease by the time it is discovered.[5] The initial symptoms of RCC often include blood in the urine (occurring in 40% of affected persons at the time they first seek medical attention), flank pain (40%), a mass in the abdomen or flank (25%), weight loss (33%), fever (20%), high blood pressure (20%), night sweats and generally feeling unwell.[1] When RCC metastasises, it most commonly spreads to the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, adrenal glands, brain or bones.[6] Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have improved the outlook for metastatic RCC.[7][8].RCC is also associated with a number of paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) which are conditions caused by either the hormones produced by the tumour or by the body's attack on the tumour and are present in about 20% of those with RCC.[1] These syndromes most commonly affect tissues which have not been invaded by the cancer.[1] The most common PNSs seen in people with RCC are: high blood calcium levels, high red blood cell count, high platelet count and secondary amyloidosis.[6].Historically, medical practitioners expected a person to present with three findings.This classic triad[9] is 1: haematuria, which is when there is blood present in the urine, 2: flank pain, which is pain on the side of the body between the hip and ribs, and 3: an abdominal mass, similar to bloating but larger.It is now known that this classic triad of symptoms only occurs in 10\u201315% of cases, and is usually indicative that the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is in an advanced stage.[9] Today, RCC is often asymptomatic (meaning few to no symptoms) and is generally detected incidentally when a person is being examined for other ailments.[10].Other signs and symptom may include haematuria;[9] loin pain;[9] abdominal mass;[10] malaise, which is a general feeling of unwellness;[10] weight loss and/or loss of appetite;[11] anaemia resulting from depression of erythropoietin;[9] erythrocytosis (increased production of red blood cells) due to increased erythropoietin secretion;[9] varicocele, which is seen in males as an enlargement of the pampiniform plexus of veins draining the testis (more often the left testis)[10] hypertension (high blood pressure) resulting from secretion of renin by the tumour;[12] hypercalcemia, which is elevation of calcium levels in the blood;[13] sleep disturbance or night sweats;[11] recurrent fevers;[11] and chronic fatigue.[14].The greatest risk factors for RCC are lifestyle-related; smoking, obesity and hypertension (high blood pressure) have been estimated to account for up to 50% of cases.[15].Occupational exposure to some chemicals such as asbestos, cadmium, lead, chlorinated solvents, petrochemicals and PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has been examined by multiple studies with inconclusive results.[16][17][18].", "Est\u00c3\u00a9e Lauder Companies": "Maximilian I (22 March 1459 \u2013 12 January 1519) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1508 until his death..Maximilian was an ambitious leader who was active in many fields and lived in a time of great upheaval between the Medieval and Early Modern worlds, Maximilian's reputation in historiography is many-sided, often contradictory: the last knight or the first modern foot soldier and \"first cannoneer of his nation\";[1][2] the first Renaissance prince (understood either as a Machiavellian politician[3] or omnicompetent, universal genius[4]) or a dilettante;[5] a far-sighted state builder and reformer, or an unrealistic schemer whose posthumous successes were based on luck,[6] or a clear-headed, prudent statesman.[7] While Austrian researchers often emphasize his role as the founder of the early modern supremacy of the House of Habsburg or founder of the nation,[8] debates on Maximilian's political activities in Germany as well as international scholarship on his reign as Holy Roman Emperor often centre on the Imperial Reform.In the Burgundian Low Countries (and the modern Netherlands and Belgium), in scholarly circles as well as popular imagination, his depictions vary as well: a foreign tyrant who imposed wars, taxes, high-handed methods of ruling and suspicious personal agenda, and then \"abandoned\" the Low Countries after gaining the imperial throne, or a saviour and builder of the early modern state.Jelle Haemers calls the relationship between the Low Countries and Maximilian \"a troubled marriage\".[9][10].In his lifetime, as the first ruler who exploited the propaganda potential of the printing press,[11] he attempted to control his own depictions, although various projects (called Gedechtnus) that he commissioned (and authored in part by him in some cases) were only finished after his death.Various authors refer to the emperor's image-building programs as \"unprecedented\".[12][13][14] Historian Thomas Brady Jr.remarks that Maximilian's humanists, artists, and printers \"created for him a virtual royal self of hitherto unimagined quality and intensity.They half-captured and half-invented a rich past, which progressed from ancient Rome through the line of Charlemagne to the glory of the house of Habsburg and culminated in Maximilian's own high presidency of the Christian brotherhood of warrior-kings.\"[15].Additionally, as his legends have many spontaneous sources, the Gedechtnus projects themselves are just one of the many tributaries of the early modern Maximiliana stream.Today, according to Elaine C.Tennant, it is impossible to determine the degree modern attention and reception to Maximilian (what Tennant dubs \"the Maximilian industry\") are influenced by the self-advertising program the emperor set in motion 500 years ago.[16] According to historian Thomas Martin Lindsay, the scholars and artists in service of the emperor could not expect much financial rewards or prestigious offices, but just like the peasantry, they genuinely loved the emperor for his romanticism, amazing intellectual versatility and other qualities.Thus, he \"lives in the folk-song of Germany like no other ruler does.\"[17] Maximilian Kr\u00fcger remarks that, although the most known of all Habsburgs, and a ruler so markedly different from all who came before him and his contemporaries, Maximilian's reputation is fading outside of the scientific ivory tower, due to general problems within German education and a culture self-defined as post-heroic and post-national.[18].Maximilian is the subject of several legends and anecdotes, which themselves would later produce inspirations for artworks..", "Peritoneum": "The peritoneum is the serous membrane forming the lining of the abdominal cavity or coelom in amniotes and some invertebrates, such as annelids.It covers most of the intra-abdominal (or coelomic) organs, and is composed of a layer of mesothelium supported by a thin layer of connective tissue.This peritoneal lining of the cavity supports many of the abdominal organs and serves as a conduit for their blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves..The abdominal cavity (the space bounded by the vertebrae, abdominal muscles, diaphragm, and pelvic floor) is different from the intraperitoneal space (located within the abdominal cavity but wrapped in peritoneum).The structures within the intraperitoneal space are called \"intraperitoneal\" (e.g., the stomach and intestines), the structures in the abdominal cavity that are located behind the intraperitoneal space are called \"retroperitoneal\" (e.g., the kidneys), and those structures below the intraperitoneal space are called \"subperitoneal\" or \"infraperitoneal\" (e.g., the bladder)..The peritoneum is one continuous sheet, forming two layers and a potential space between them: the peritoneal cavity..The outer layer, the parietal peritoneum, is attached to the abdominal wall and the pelvic walls.[1] The tunica vaginalis, the serous membrane covering the male testis, is derived from the vaginal process, an outpouching of the parietal peritoneum..The inner layer, the visceral peritoneum, is wrapped around the visceral organs, located inside the intraperitoneal space for protection.It is thinner than the parietal peritoneum.The mesentery is a double layer of visceral peritoneum that attaches to the gastrointestinal tract.There are often blood vessels, nerves, and other structures between these layers.The space between these two layers is technically outside of the peritoneal sac, and thus not in the peritoneal cavity..", "Solid-state drive": "A solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, and functions as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage.[1] It is also sometimes called a semiconductor storage device, a solid-state device, or a solid-state disk,[2] even though SSDs lack the physical spinning disks and movable read\u2013write heads used in hard disk drives (HDDs) and floppy disks.[3] SSD also has rich internal parallelism for data processing.[4].In comparison to hard disk drives and similar electromechanical media which use moving parts, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run silently, and have higher input/output rates and lower latency.[5] SSDs store data in semiconductor cells.As of 2019,[update] cells can contain between 1 and 4 bits of data.SSD storage devices vary in their properties according to the number of bits stored in each cell, with single-bit cells (\"Single Level Cells\" or \"SLC\") being generally the most reliable, durable, fast, and expensive type, compared with 2- and 3-bit cells (\"Multi-Level Cells/MLC\" and \"Triple-Level Cells/TLC\"), and finally, quad-bit cells (\"QLC\") being used for consumer devices that do not require such extreme properties and are the cheapest per gigabyte (GB) of the four.In addition, 3D XPoint memory (sold by Intel under the Optane brand) stores data by changing the electrical resistance of cells instead of storing electrical charges in cells, and SSDs made from RAM can be used for high speed, when data persistence after power loss is not required, or may use battery power to retain data when its usual power source is unavailable.[6] Hybrid drives or solid-state hybrid drives (SSHDs), such as Intel's Hystor[7] and Apple's Fusion Drive, combine features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit using both flash memory and spinning magnetic disks in order to improve the performance of frequently-accessed data.[8][9][10] Bcache achieves a similar effect purely in software, using combinations of dedicated regular SSDs and HDDs..SSDs based on NAND flash will slowly leak charge over time if left for long periods without power.This causes worn-out drives (that have exceeded their endurance rating) to start losing data typically after one year (if stored at 30\u00b0C) to two years (at 25\u00b0C) in storage; for new drives it takes longer.[11] Therefore, SSDs are not suitable for archival storage.3D XPoint is a possible exception to this rule; it is a relatively new technology with unknown long-term data-retention characteristics..SSDs can use traditional HDD interfaces and form factors, or newer interfaces and form factors that exploit specific advantages of the flash memory in SSDs.Traditional interfaces (e.g.SATA and SAS) and standard HDD form factors allow such SSDs to be used as drop-in replacements for HDDs in computers and other devices.Newer form factors such as mSATA, M.2, U.2, NF1/M.3/NGSFF,[12][13] XFM Express (Crossover Flash Memory, form factor XT2)[14] and EDSFF (formerly known as Ruler SSD)[15][16] and higher speed interfaces such as NVM Express (NVMe) over PCI Express (PCIe) can further increase performance over HDD performance.[6] SSDs have a limited lifetime number of writes, and also slow down as they reach their full storage capacity..", "Caviar": "Caviar (also known as caviare, originally from Persian: \u062e\u0627\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u0631, romanized:kh\u00e2vy\u00e2r, lit.\u2009'egg-bearing') is a food consisting of salt-cured roe of the family Acipenseridae.Caviar is considered a delicacy and is eaten as a garnish or spread.[1] Traditionally, the term caviar refers only to roe from wild sturgeon in the Caspian Sea and Black Sea[2] (beluga, ossetra and sevruga caviars).The term caviar can also describe the roe of other species of sturgeon or other fish such as paddlefish, salmon, steelhead, trout, lumpfish, whitefish,[3] or carp.[4].The roe can be \"fresh\" (non-pasteurized) or pasteurized, which reduces its culinary and economic value.[5].According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, roe from any fish not belonging to the Acipenseriformes order (including Acipenseridae, or sturgeon sensu stricto, and Polyodontidae or paddlefish) are not caviar, but \"substitutes of caviar\".[6] This position is also adopted by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,[7] the World Wide Fund for Nature,[8] the United States Customs Service,[9] and France.[10].The term caviar is sometimes used to describe dishes that are perceived to resemble caviar, such as \"eggplant caviar\" (made from eggplant) and \"Texas caviar\" (made from black-eyed peas)..Caviar and sturgeon from the Sea of Azov began reaching the tables of aristocratic and noble Greeks in the 10th century, after the commencement of large-scale trading between the Byzantine Empire and Kyivan Rus'.[11].The main types of caviar from sturgeon species native to the Caspian Sea are Beluga, Sterlet, Kaluga hybrid, Ossetra, Siberian sturgeon and Sevruga.American White Sturgeon caviar is abundant and native to California and the U.S.Pacific Northwest.The rarest and costliest is from beluga sturgeon that swim in the Caspian Sea, which is bordered by Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan.Wild caviar production was suspended in Russia between 2008 and 2011 to allow wild stocks to replenish.", "SEC Network": "SEC Network (SECN) is an American multinational sports network owned by ESPN Inc., a joint venture between The Walt Disney Company (which operates the network, through its 80% controlling ownership interest) and Hearst Communications (which holds the remaining 20% interest).The channel is dedicated to coverage of collegiate sports sanctioned by the Southeastern Conference (SEC) including live and recorded event telecasts, news, analysis programs, and other content focusing on the conference's member schools.[1][2]  The network is estimated to have 70 million subscribers, more than any other dedicated sports network.[3].The network's coverage serves as the successor to an eponymous syndication package (later renamed SEC TV), which was produced by its syndication arm ESPN Regional Television.[1] SEC Network is operated out of ESPN facilities in Charlotte, North Carolina, shared with ESPN Events, some operations for the ACC Network, and formerly ESPNU.While Charlotte is not an SEC market itself, it is in close proximity to universities that are members of the conference and shares a television market with the northern part of South Carolina, which is part of the South Carolina Gamecocks' television market.[4][5].The network's digital platform, SEC Network+ (SECN+), streams on ESPN.com and the ESPN app for SEC Network subscribers, and carries SEC events not broadcast on television.SECN+ broadcasts are simulcast on ESPN+..On May 2, 2013, SEC Commissioner Michael Slive and ESPN president John Skipper formally announced that as part of a long-term, 20-year agreement lasting through 2034, ESPN would launch SEC Network, a network devoted to the conference and an accompanying digital platform, in August 2014.The network would aim to provide \"unparalleled content from one of the most competitive conferences in the country with the highest quality, most innovative production partner in the sports industry\", and joins the Big Ten Network and Pac-12 Network as cable television networks devoted entirely to a single college athletics conference.[4][5].During the announcement of the SEC's football schedule for the 2014 season, Michael Slive officially announced that SEC Network would launch on August 14, 2014.Its first live regular season football games aired on August 28, 2014, between Texas A&M and South Carolina,[2] and Temple and Vanderbilt.[6].SEC Network officially launched on August 14, 2014, at 6:00p.m.ET with the premiere of its news program SEC Now, which featured live broadcasts from each SEC school, highlights from football training camps, and live look-ins of an exhibition women's soccer game between the Arkansas Razorbacks and Creighton Bluejays (which was broadcast in its entirety via WatchESPN as the first live event produced by SEC Network).[7][8][9].", "1990s": "The 1990s (pronounced \"nineteen-nineties\", shortened to \"the '90s\" and often referred to as simply \"the Nineties\") was a decade that began on January 1, 1990, and ended on December 31, 1999..Known as the \"post-Cold War decade\", the 1990s are culturally imagined by many as the period from the Revolutions of 1989 until the war on terror of the 2000s.[1] The dissolution of the Soviet Union marked the end of Russia's status as a superpower, the establishment of new independent soviet states, the end of a multipolar world, and the rise of anti-Western sentiment.Russia was in economic and political chaos due to neoliberal shock therapy reforms under President Boris Yeltsin until Vladimir Putin came to power in the next decade while China was still recovering from a politically and economically turbulent period under Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin.[2] This allowed for the United States to emerge as the world's sole superpower during this decade after the Cold War..The decade saw greater attention to multiculturalism as well as the advance of alternative media.In the built environment, the McMansion version of postmodern architecture remained strong throughout the decade.Public education about safe sex curbed the spread of the HIV virus in developed countries.Generation X young people often bonded over musical tastes.Humor in television and film was often marked by ironic self-reference mixed with popular culture references.Alternative music movements like grunge, Eurodance, and hip-hop, became popular with young adults worldwide, aided by the rise in popularity of tiered pricing satellite and cable television, and the internet.New music genres such as drum and bass, post-rock, happy hardcore, denpa, and trance emerged in the 1990s.The computer game industry began to boom again, the rivalry of music and film markets.Video game popularity exploded due to the development of CD-ROM supported 3DCG on platforms such as Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, and PCs..", "Gray Wolf": "See Subspecies of Canis lupus.The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl.: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America.More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog and dingo, though gray wolves, as popularly understood, only comprise naturally-occurring wild subspecies.The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail.The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them.The wolf's fur is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white..Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour, including individual or group howling.It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring.Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack.Wolves are also territorial, and fights over territory are among the principal causes of mortality.The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs.", "Roman Empire": "The Roman Empire[a] was the post-Republican state of ancient Rome and is generally understood to mean the period and territory ruled by the Romans following Octavian's assumption of sole rule under the Principate in 31 BC.It included territory in Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, and was ruled by emperors.The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 conventionally marks the end of classical antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages..Rome had expanded its rule to most of the Mediterranean and beyond, but became severely destabilized in civil wars and political conflicts which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt.In 27 BC the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching power (imperium) and the new title of Augustus, marking his accession as the first Roman emperor of a monarchy with Rome as its sole capital.The vast Roman territories were organized in senatorial and imperial provinces..The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (lit.\u2009'Roman Peace').Rome reached its greatest territorial expanse under Trajan (AD 98\u2013117); a period of increasing trouble and decline began under Commodus (180\u2013192).In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a crisis that threatened its existence, as the Gallic and Palmyrene Empires broke away from the Roman state, and a series of short-lived emperors led the Empire.It was reunified under Aurelian (r.\u2009270\u2013275).Diocletian set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West in 286; Christians rose to power in the 4th century following the Edict of Milan.The imperial seat moved from Rome to Byzantium in 330, renamed Constantinople after Constantine the Great.", "Education in the United States": "In the United States, education is provided in public and private schools and by individuals through homeschooling.State governments set overall educational standards, often mandate standardized tests for K\u201312 public school systems and supervise, usually through a board of regents, state colleges, and universities.The bulk of the $1.3 trillion in funding comes from state and local governments, with federal funding accounting for about $260 billion in 2021[9] compared to around $200 billion in past years.[2].Private schools are free to determine their own curriculum and staffing policies, with voluntary accreditation available through independent regional accreditation authorities, although some state regulation can apply..In 2013, about 87% of school-age children (those below higher education) attended state-funded public schools, about 10% attended tuition and foundation-funded private schools,[10] and roughly 3% were home-schooled.[11].By state law, education is compulsory over an age range starting between five and eight and ending somewhere between ages sixteen and eighteen, depending on the state.[12] This requirement can be satisfied in public or state-certified private schools, or an approved home school program.Compulsory education is divided into three levels: elementary school, middle or junior high school, and high school..Numerous publicly and privately administered colleges and universities offer a wide variety in post-secondary education.Post-secondary education is divided into college, as the first tertiary degree, and graduate school.Higher education includes public research universities, private liberal arts colleges, historically black colleges and universities, community colleges, for-profit colleges, and many other kinds and combinations of institutions.College enrollment rates in the United States have increased over the long term.[13] At the same time, student loan debt has also risen to $1.5trillion..The large majority of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25, and the most prestigious \u2013 the Harvard University,[14][15][16][17] and the country placed first in the annual U.S.", "Paul Bragg": "Paul Chappuis Bragg (February 6, 1895 \u2013 December 7, 1976) was an American alternative health food advocate and fitness enthusiast.[1] Bragg's mentor was Bernarr Macfadden.[1] He wrote on subjects such as detoxification, dieting, fasting, longevity, orthopathy and physical culture.Medical experts criticized Bragg as a food faddist and promoter of quackery.[2].Bragg claimed to have been born in 1881 in either Fairfax County, Virginia or Pinkle, Virginia,[3][4] but genealogical research indicates he was born on February 6, 1895, in Batesville, Indiana, where his father was editor, publisher, and printer of the \"Batesville Democratic Herald\" newspaper..Bragg grew up in Washington, D.C., with his parents, Robert Elton Bragg (1866\u20131944), who had procured a U.S.Civil Service position there,[5] and Caroline (Chappuis) Bragg (1859-1934).He had two brothers, James Elton Bragg and John Harrison Bragg.His father was employed by the U.S.Printing Office.[6] However, in the 1972 Edition of the Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar System booklet, at page 12, and in later editions, Bragg claimed both that his father was \"a splendid farmer\" and that \"I am the oldest of 16 children\"..There is no evidence of a sister  named \"Louise\" that Bragg claimed to have tutored to good health in his \"Miracle of Fasting\" publications, Paul Bragg and his two brothers did have a half brother named \"Rufus Albert Chappuis\" (1880\u20131948), from an earlier marriage of their mother, Caroline.[7].At age 16, it is alleged that Bragg had tuberculosis which was cured at Auguste Rollier's sun sanatorium.[8].At some point, Bragg enlisted with the Washington, D.C., National Guard for \"three Years\", as is shown on his 1917 Draft Registration, which he filed with the Indianapolis, Indiana draft board that year.[9].Although Bragg had claimed participation in both the 1908 (London) and 1912 (Stockholm) Olympics as a member of the United States wrestling team, the \"Encyclopedia of American Wrestling\" (Pub.", "Sonic boom": "A sonic boom is a sound associated with shock waves created when an object travels through the air faster than the speed of sound.Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy, sounding similar to an explosion or a thunderclap to the human ear..The crack of a supersonic bullet passing overhead or the crack of a bullwhip are examples of a sonic boom in miniature.[2].Sonic booms due to large supersonic aircraft can be particularly loud and startling, tend to awaken people, and may cause minor damage to some structures.This led to the prohibition of routine supersonic flight overland.Although they cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle, the nuisance due to the sonic booms may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a feasible option.[3][4].A sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the sound barrier and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the supersonic object.Rather, the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is traveling at supersonic speeds and affects only observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object.As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the observer, they will briefly experience the \"boom\"..When an aircraft passes through the air, it creates a series of pressure waves in front of the aircraft and behind it, similar to the bow and stern waves created by a boat.These waves travel at the speed of sound and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other's way quickly enough.Eventually, they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as Mach 1, and is approximately 1,192km/h (741mph) at sea level and 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F)..", "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno": "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno is an American late-night talk show hosted by Jay Leno that first aired from May 25, 1992, to May 29, 2009.It resumed production on March 1, 2010 and ended on February 6, 2014..The fourth incarnation of the Tonight Show franchise debuted on May 25, 1992, three days after Johnny Carson's retirement as host of the program.The program originated from NBC Studios in Burbank, California, and was broadcast Monday through Friday at 11:35p.m.in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (10:35p.m.Central/Mountain time).Unlike Carson or his predecessor Jack Paar, Leno only once used a guest host, preferring to host the series in person..The series, which followed the same basic format as that of its predecessors (an opening monologue followed by comedy routines, interviews and performances), ran until May 29, 2009, after which Leno was succeeded by Conan O'Brien.[3] NBC signed Leno to a new deal for a nightly talk show in the 10:00pm ET timeslot.The primetime series, titled The Jay Leno Show, debuted on September 14, 2009,[4] following a similar format to the Leno incarnation of Tonight.[5][6][7].Neither O'Brien's version of the program, which premiered June 1, 2009 nor The Jay Leno Show generated the ratings NBC had expected.The network decided to move a condensed 30-minute version of Leno's show to O'Brien's time slot, and O'Brien's Tonight Show a half-hour later.This decision met with opposition from O'Brien, whose stint on The Tonight Show ended January 22, 2010, after which he began his own talk show, Conan, on TBS.", "Radio-frequency identification": "Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.An RFID system consists of a tiny radio transponder, a radio receiver and transmitter.When triggered by an electromagnetic interrogation pulse from a nearby RFID reader device, the tag transmits digital data, usually an identifying inventory number, back to the reader.This number can be used to track inventory goods.[1].Passive tags are powered by energy from the RFID reader's interrogating radio waves.Active tags are powered by a battery and thus can be read at a greater range from the RFID reader, up to hundreds of meters..Unlike a barcode, the tag does not need to be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object.RFID is one method of automatic identification and data capture (AIDC).[2].RFID tags are used in many industries.For example, an RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line, RFID-tagged pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses, and implanting RFID microchips in livestock and pets enables positive identification of animals.[3][4] Tags can also be used in shops to expedite checkout, and to prevent theft by customers and employees.[5].Since RFID tags can be attached to physical money, clothing, and possessions, or implanted in animals and people, the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised serious privacy concerns.[6] These concerns resulted in standard specifications development addressing privacy and security issues..In 2014, the world RFID market was worth US$8.89 billion, up from US$7.77 billion in 2013 and US$6.96 billion in 2012.", "Id, ego and super-ego": "In psychoanalytic theory, the id, ego and super-ego are three distinct, interacting agents in the psychic apparatus, defined in Sigmund Freud's structural model of the psyche.The three agents are theoretical constructs that Freud employed to describe the basic structure of mental life as it was encountered in psychoanalytic practice.Freud himself used the German terms das Es, Ich, and \u00dcber-Ich, which literally translate as \"the it\", \"I\", and \"over-I\".The Latin terms id, ego and super-ego were chosen by his original translators and have remained in use..In the ego psychology model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual desires; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic agent that mediates between the instinctual desires of the id and the critical super-ego;[1] Freud compared the ego (in its relation to the id) to a man on horseback: the rider must harness and direct the superior energy of his mount, and at times allow for a practicable satisfaction of its urges.The ego is thus \"in the habit of transforming the id's will into action, as if it were its own.\"[2].Freud introduced the structural model (id, ego, super-ego) in the essay Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920) in response to the unstructured ambiguity and conflicting uses of the term \"the unconscious mind\".He elaborated, refined, and formalised that model in the essay The Ego and the Id (1923).[3].The terms \"id\", \"ego\", and \"super-ego\" are not Freud's own; they are latinisations by his translator James Strachey.Freud himself wrote of \"das Es\",[4] \"das Ich\",[5]  and \"das \u00dcber-Ich\"[6]\u2014respectively, \"the It\", \"the I\", and \"the Over-I\".Thus, to the German reader, Freud's original terms are to some degree self-explanatory.The term \"das Es\" was originally used by Georg Groddeck, a physician whose unconventional ideas were of interest to Freud (Groddeck's translators render the term in English as \"the It\").[7] The word ego is taken directly from Latin, where it is the nominative of the first person singular personal pronoun and is translated as \"I myself\" to express emphasis..", "Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps": "The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) is one of the three primary commissioning sources for officers in the United States Air Force and United States Space Force, the other two being the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) and Air Force Officer Training School (OTS).[1] A subordinate command of the Air University within the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), AFROTC is aligned under the Jeanne M.Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development at Maxwell AFB, Alabama.The Holm Center, formerly known as the Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS), retains direct responsibility for both AFROTC and OTS..AFROTC is the largest and oldest source of commissioned officers for the U.S.Air Force.[2] AFROTC's stated mission is to produce quality leaders for the U.S.Air Force.AFROTC units are located on 145 college and university campuses with 1100+ additional institutions of higher learning participating in cross-town agreements that allow their students to attend AFROTC classes at a nearby \"host\" college or university.[2] According to AFROTC HQ, in 2006, AFROTC commissioned 2,083 USAF Second Lieutenants, with AFROTC enrollment ranging from 23,605 in 1985 to 10,231 in 1993, and around 13,000 enrolled today..AFROTC units at colleges and universities are called \"detachments,\" and are headed by an active duty USAF officer in the rank of colonel or lieutenant colonel who functions as both the Detachment Commander for USAF purposes and with the nominal title of professor of aerospace studies (PAS) within the institution's academic community.Most colleges and universities will designate the AFROTC detachment as the Department of Aerospace Studies.Depending on the detachment size, the PAS is typically assisted by one to four assistant professors of aerospace studies (APAS), also all active-duty USAF officers.Most APAS hold the rank of captain; however, some are also first lieutenants or majors.Approximately three USAF non-commissioned officers and one senior non-commissioned officer will typically provide military administrative support and are often augmented by one to two civilian staff support employees of the academic institution.", "Paper density": "Paper density is a paper product's mass per unit volume.The density can be calculated by dividing the grammage of paper (in grams per square metre or \"gsm\") by its caliper (usually in micrometres, occasionally in mils).[1].The \"ISO 534:2011, Paper and board \u2014 Determination of thickness, density and specific volume\" indicates that the paper density is expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3).[2].This material-related article

for the Las Vegas Aces of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).Widely regarded as one of the greatest WNBA players of all time,[2][3] she was selected as the first overall pick in the 2008 WNBA draft by the Los Angeles Sparks.[4] She spent 13 seasons on the Sparks and two seasons with the Chicago Sky, winning a championship with each team..A versatile player, Parker mainly plays the forward and center positions.In high school, Parker won the 2003 and 2004 Gatorade National Girls Basketball Player of the Year awards, becoming just the second junior and the only woman to receive the award twice.As a college player for Tennessee, she led the team to two consecutive national championships (2007, 2008), was named the Final Four's most outstanding player in both occasions and was a two-time consensus national player of the year.As a redshirt freshman, she became the first woman to dunk in an NCAA tournament game and the first woman to dunk twice in a college game.[5] After being selected in the WNBA Draft, Parker signed long-term endorsement deals with Adidas and Gatorade.[6][7].In 2016, Parker led the Sparks to win their first WNBA Finals title since 2002 and won the WNBA Finals MVP Award.In 2021, she helped the Sky win their first title.Parker has won two WNBA Most Valuable Player Awards (2008, 2013), a WNBA All-Star Game MVP Award (2013), two Olympic gold medals (2008, 2012), and the WNBA Rookie of the Year Award (2008).She has been selected to six All-WNBA teams and five All-Star teams, and was the first player to win the Rookie of the Year and the MVP awards in the same season.[8] Parker became the second player to dunk in a WNBA game on June 22, 2008.[9][10].Since 2018, Parker has been an analyst and commentator for Turner Sports, providing coverage for NBA games on TNT and NBA TV and for the NCAA men's basketball tournament.[11].Parker was born on April 19, 1986, in St.", "Food guide pyramid": "A food pyramid is a representation of the optimal number of servings to be eaten each day from each of the basic food groups.[2] The first pyramid was published in Sweden in 1974.[3][4][5] The 1992 pyramid introduced by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was called the \"Food Guide Pyramid\" or \"Eating Right Pyramid\".It was updated in 2005 to \"MyPyramid\", and then it was replaced by \"MyPlate\" in 2011.[6][7].Amid high food prices in 1972, Sweden's National Board of Health and Welfare developed the idea of \"basic foods\" that were both cheap and nutritious, and \"supplemental foods\" that added nutrition missing from the basic foods.Anna-Britt Agns\u00e4ter, chief of the test kitchen for Kooperativa F\u00f6rbundet (a cooperative Swedish retail chain), held a lecture the next year on how to illustrate these food groups.Attendee Fjalar Clemes suggested a triangle displaying basic foods at the base.Agns\u00e4ter developed the idea into the first food pyramid, which was introduced to the public in 1974 in KF's Vi magazine.[3][4][5] The pyramid was divided into basic foods at the base, including milk, cheese, margarine, bread, cereals and potato; a large section of supplemental vegetables and fruit; and an apex of supplemental meat, fish and egg.The pyramid competed with the National Board's \"dietary circle\", which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices, and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten.While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid, KF continued to promote it..Food pyramids were developed in other Scandinavian countries, as well as West Germany, Japan and Sri Lanka.The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992..The World Health Organization, in conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, published guidelines that can be effectively represented in a food pyramid relating to objectives in order to prevent obesity, improper nutrition, chronic diseases and dental caries based on meta-analysis [8][9] though they represent it as a table rather than as a \"pyramid\".The structure is similar in some respects to the USDA food pyramid, but there are clear distinctions between types of fats, and a more dramatic distinction where carbohydrates are categorized on the basis of free sugars versus sugars in their natural form.", "Hans Christian Andersen": "Hans Christian Andersen (/\u02c8\u00e6nd\u0259rs\u0259n/ AN-d\u0259r-s\u0259n, Danish: [\u02c8h\u00e6n\u02c0s \u02c8k\u02b0\u0281estj\u00e6n \u02c8\u0251n\u0250sn\u0329] \u24d8; 2 April 1805\u2013 4 August 1875) was a Danish author.Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, he is best remembered for his literary fairy tales..Andersen's fairy tales, consisting of 156 stories across nine volumes,[1] have been translated into more than 125 languages.[2] They have become culturally embedded in the West's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers as well.[3]  His most famous fairy tales include \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", \"The Little Mermaid\", \"The Nightingale\", \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\", \"The Red Shoes\", \"The Princess and the Pea\", \"The Snow Queen\", \"The Ugly Duckling\", \"The Little Match Girl\", and \"Thumbelina\".His stories have inspired ballets, plays, and animated and live-action films.[4].Hans Christian Andersen was born in Odense, Denmark on 2 April 1805.He had a stepsister named Karen.[5] His father, also named Hans, considered himself related to nobility (his paternal grandmother had told his father that their family had belonged to a higher social class,[6] but investigations have disproved these stories).[6][7] Although it has been challenged,[6] a persistent speculation suggests that Andersen was an illegitimate son of King Christian VIII.Danish historian Jens J\u00f8rgensen supported this idea in his book H.C.Andersen, en sand myte [a true myth].[8].Hans Christian Andersen was baptised on 15 April 1805 in Saint Hans Church (St John's Church) in Odense, Denmark.His certificate of birth was not drafted until November 1823, according to which six Godparents were present at the baptising ceremony: Madam Sille Marie Breineberg, Maiden Friederiche Pommer, shoemaker Peder Waltersdorff, journeyman carpenter Anders J\u00f8rgensen, hospital porter Nicolas Gomard, and royal hatter Jens Henrichsen Dorch..Andersen's father, who had received an elementary school education, introduced his son to literature, reading to him the Arabian Nights.[9] Andersen's mother, Anne Marie Andersdatter, was an illiterate washerwoman.Following her husband's death in 1816, she remarried in 1818.[9] Andersen was sent to a local school for poor children where he received a basic education and had to support himself, working as an apprentice to a weaver and, later, to a tailor.", "Eye contact": "Eye contact occurs when two people or animals look at each other's eyes at the same time.[1] In people, eye contact is a form of nonverbal communication and can have a large influence on social behavior.Coined in the early to mid-1960s, the term came from the West to often define the act as a meaningful and important sign of confidence and respect.[2] The customs, meaning, and significance of eye contact can vary greatly between societies, neurotypes, and religions..The study of eye contact is sometimes known as oculesics.[3].Eye contact and facial expressions provide important social and emotional information.People, perhaps without consciously doing so, search other's eyes and faces for positive or negative mood signs.In some contexts, the meeting of eyes arouses strong emotions..Eye contact provides some of the strongest emotions during a social conversation.This primarily is because it provides details on emotions and intentions.In a group, if eye contact is not inclusive of a certain individual, it can make that individual feel left out of the group; while on the other hand, prolonged eye contact can tell someone you are interested in what they have to say.[4].Eye contact is also an important element in flirting, where it may serve to establish and gauge the other's interest in some situations.Mutual eye contact that signals attraction initially begins as a brief glance and progresses into a repeated volleying of eye contact.[5].In the process of civil inattention, strangers in close proximity, such as a crowd, avoid eye contact in order to help maintain their privacy.[citation needed].", "Bed bug": "Bed bugs are parasitic insects from the genus Cimex, who are micropredators that feed on blood, usually at night.[7] Their bites can result in a number of health impacts including skin rashes, psychological effects, and allergic symptoms.[5] Bed bug bites may lead to skin changes ranging from small areas of redness to prominent blisters.[1][2] Symptoms may take between minutes to days to appear and itchiness is generally present.[2] Some individuals may feel tired or have a fever.[2] Typically, uncovered areas of the body are affected.[2] Their bites are not known to transmit any infectious disease.[5][7][8] Complications may rarely include areas of dead skin or vasculitis.[2].Bed bug bites are caused primarily by two species of insects: Cimex lectularius (the common bed bug) and Cimex hemipterus, found primarily in the tropics.[3] Their size ranges between 1 and 7mm.[7] They spread by crawling between nearby locations or by being carried within personal items.[2] Infestation is rarely due to a lack of hygiene but is more common in high-density areas.[2][9] Diagnosis involves both finding the bugs and the occurrence of compatible symptoms.[5] Bed bugs spend much of their time in dark, hidden locations like mattress seams, or cracks in a wall.[2].Treatment is directed towards the symptoms.[2] Eliminating bed bugs from the home is often difficult, partly because bed bugs can survive up to approximately 300 days without feeding.[6][8] Repeated treatments of a home may be required.[2] These treatments may include heating the room to 50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F) for more than 90 minutes, frequent vacuuming, washing clothing at high temperatures, and the use of various pesticides.[2].Fossils found in Egypt show bed bugs have been known as human parasites for at least 3,500 years.[10] Despite being nearly eradicated in developed countries after WW2, infestations have increased since the 1990s and bed bugs are now relatively common in all regions of the globe.[7][3][4][6] The exact causes of this increase are unclear; theories include increased human travel, more frequent exchange of second-hand furnishings, a greater focus on control of other pests, and increasing resistance to pesticides.[4].Bed bugs infest dwellings and bite people, causing irritation and sometimes other issues.There is no evidence that bed bugs transmit infectious diseases[5][7] even though they appear physically capable of carrying pathogens and this possibility has been investigated.[3][5].The most common skin findings associated with bed bug bites are itching, flat and bumpy, reddish lesions.[8] Each lesion is about 2\u20135mm (0.08\u20130.2in) but may be as large as 2cm (0.8in) in diameter and there may or may not be a central spot (punctum).[8] Bites are usually present on areas of exposed skin, especially exposed areas not covered by sheets or blankets, such as arms, legs, feet, face or neck.[8] Individual responses to bites vary, ranging from no visible effect (in about 20\u201370%),[3][5] to small flat (macular) spots, to the formation of prominent blisters (wheals and bullae) along with intense itching that may last several days.[5] Vesicles and nodules may also form.The lesions due to bites may become secondarily infected due to scratching but systemic effects from bed bug bites are very rare.[8] A central spot of bleeding may also occur due to the release of blood thinning substances in the bug's saliva.[4].Symptoms may not appear until some days after the bites have occurred.[5] Reactions often become brisker after multiple bites due to possible sensitization to the salivary proteins of the bed bug.[3] Numerous bites may lead to a red rash or hives.[5].Bedbug bites may cause other symptoms and health issues.Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis from the injection of serum and other non-specific proteins have been documented, though rarely.[5][11] As each bite takes a tiny amount of blood, chronic or severe infestation may lead to anemia.[5] Scratching bites may lead to bacterial skin infection.[5][12] Systemic poisoning may occur if the bites are numerous.[13] The bite itself may be painful thus resulting in poor sleep and worse work performance.[5].Bed bugs can feed on warm-blooded animals other than humans, such as pets.", "Book of Isaiah": "The Book of Isaiah (Hebrew: \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e2\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5 [\u02c8s\u025b.f\u025br j\u0259.\u0283a\u0295.\u02c8ja\u02d0.hu]) is the first of the Latter Prophets in the Hebrew Bible and the first of the Major Prophets in the Christian Old Testament.[1] It is identified by a superscription as the words of the 8th-century BCE prophet Isaiah ben Amoz, but there is evidence that much of it was composed during the Babylonian captivity and later.[2] Johann Christoph D\u00f6derlein suggested in 1775 that the book contained the works of two prophets separated by more than a century,[3] and Bernhard Duhm originated the view, held as a consensus through most of the 20th century, that the book comprises three separate collections of oracles:[4][5] Proto-Isaiah (chapters 1\u201339), containing the words of the 8th-century BCE prophet Isaiah; Deutero-Isaiah (chapters 40\u201355), the work of an anonymous 6th-century BCE author writing during the Exile; and Trito-Isaiah (chapters 56\u201366), composed after the return from Exile.[6] Isaiah 1\u201333 promises judgment and restoration for Judah, Jerusalem and the nations, and chapters 34\u201366 presume that judgment has been pronounced and restoration follows soon.[7] While few scholars today attribute the entire book, or even most of it, to one person,[4] the book's essential unity has become a focus in more recent research.[8].The book can be read as an extended meditation on the destiny of Jerusalem into and after the Exile.[9].The Deutero-Isaian part of the book describes how God will make Jerusalem the centre of his worldwide rule through a royal saviour (a messiah) who will destroy the oppressor (Babylon); this messiah is the Persian king Cyrus the Great, who is merely the agent who brings about Yahweh's kingship.[10] Isaiah speaks out against corrupt leaders and for the disadvantaged, and roots righteousness in God's holiness rather than in Israel's covenant.[11].Isaiah was one of the most popular works among Jews in the Second Temple period (c.515 BCE \u2013 70 CE).[12] In Christian circles, it was held in such high regard as to be called \"the Fifth Gospel\",[13] and its influence extends beyond Christianity to English literature and to Western culture in general, from the libretto of Handel's Messiah to a host of such everyday phrases as \"swords into ploughshares\" and \"voice in the wilderness\".[14].General scholarly consensus through most of the 20th century saw three separate collections of oracles in the book of Isaiah.[4] A typical outline based on this understanding of the book sees its underlying structure in terms of the identification of historical figures who might have been their authors:[15].While one part of the general consensus still holds, this perception of Isaiah as made up of three rather distinct sections underwent a radical challenge in the last quarter of the 20th century.[17] The newer approach looks at the book in terms of its literary and formal characteristics, rather than authors, and sees in it a two-part structure divided between chapters 33 and 34:[18].Seeing Isaiah as a two-part book (chapters 1\u201333 and 34\u201366) with an overarching theme leads to a summary of its contents like the following:[10].The older understanding of this book as three fairly discrete sections attributable to identifiable authors leads to a more atomised picture of its contents, as in this example:.While it is widely accepted that the book of Isaiah is rooted in a historic prophet called Isaiah, who lived in the Kingdom of Judah during the 8th century BCE, it is also widely accepted that this prophet did not write the entire book of Isaiah.[9][22].The composition history of Isaiah reflects a major difference in the way authorship was regarded in ancient Israel and in modern societies; the ancients did not regard it as inappropriate to supplement an existing work while remaining anonymous.[26] While the authors are anonymous, it is plausible that all of them were priests, and the book may thus reflect Priestly concerns, in opposition to the increasingly successful reform movement of the Deuteronomists.[27].The historic Isaiah ben Amoz lived in the Kingdom of Judah during the reigns of four kings from the mid to late 8th-century BCE.[22][29] During this period, Assyria was expanding westward from its origins in modern-day northern Iraq towards the Mediterranean, destroying first Aram (modern Syria) in 734\u2013732 BCE, then the Kingdom of Israel in 722\u2013721, and finally subjugating Judah in 701.[30] Proto-Isaiah is divided between verse and prose passages, and a currently popular theory is that the verse passages represent the prophecies of the original 8th-century Isaiah, while the prose sections are \"sermons\" on his texts composed at the court of Josiah a hundred years later, at the end of the 7th century.[31].", "Oregon State University": "Oregon State University (OSU) is a public land-grant research university based in Corvallis, Oregon.OSU offers more than 200 undergraduate-degree programs along with a variety of graduate and doctoral degrees.It has the seventh-largest engineering college in the nation for 2023.[11] Undergraduate enrollment for all colleges combined averages over 32,000 while an additional 5,000 students are engaged in post-graduate coursework through the university.[12] In 2023, over 37,000 students were enrolled at OSU - making it the largest university in the state.Out-of-state students typically make up over one-quarter of the student body.Since its founding, over 272,000 students have graduated from OSU.[13] It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\".[14].Chartered as a land-grant university initially, OSU became one of the four inaugural members of the Sea Grant in 1971.[15] Memberships in the Space Grant and Sun Grant research consortia were awarded in 1991 and 2003, making it one of only three schools in the nation to obtain land, sun, sea and space grant memberships.[16] OSU received a record high $449.9 million in research funding for the 2022 fiscal year and has ranked as the state's top earner in research funding for over 50 years.[17] OSU is also one of the top five doctoral university destinations in the nation for Fulbright Scholars (2022\u20132023).[18].The university's roots date to 1856, when it was founded as a primary and preparatory community school known as Corvallis Academy.The school's first teacher and principal was John Wesley Johnson, a famous figure in Oregon higher education.Johnson received his secondary education in Corvallis and his undergraduate from Pacific University before working at the new academy.He later attended Yale University and became an instrumental figure in the development and administration of several other early Oregon colleges.[19] Within a decade of its inception, college-level coursework was added to the academy's curriculum, making it the first public college in the region and a magnet for Oregon's young adults seeking a profession.[20] The university adopted eight name variations during the 1800s and three more in the 1900s.Like many of today's land-grant colleges and universities, name changes were common during this period and helped schools better align with some of the largest available grants in agricultural research.[21][22][23].Corvallis area Freemasons played a leading role in developing the early school.", "Female ejaculation": "Female ejaculation is characterized as an expulsion of fluid from the Skene's gland at the lower end of the urethra during or before an orgasm.It is also known colloquially as squirting (or gushing), although research indicates that female ejaculation and squirting are different phenomena,  squirting being attributed to a sudden expulsion of liquid that partly comes from the bladder and contains urine.[1][2].Female ejaculation is physiologically distinct from coital incontinence, with which it is sometimes confused.[3][4].There have been few studies on female ejaculation.[5] A failure to adopt common definitions and research methodology by the scientific community has been the primary contributor to this lack of experimental data.[6] Research has suffered from highly selected participants, narrow case studies, or very small sample sizes, and consequently has yet to produce significant results.Much of the research into the composition of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is, or contains, urine.[5][7] It is common for any secretion that exits the vagina, and for fluid that exits the urethra, during sexual activity to be referred to as female ejaculate, which has led to significant confusion in the literature.[7].Whether the fluid is secreted by the Skene's gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals, and are related to doubts over the existence of the G-spot,[8][9][7] there is substantial evidence that the Skene's gland is the source of female ejaculation.[1][7] The function of female ejaculation, however, remains unclear.[7].In questionnaire surveys, 35\u201350% of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm.[10][11][12] Other studies find anywhere from 10 to 69%, depending on the definitions and methods used.[13][14] For instance Kratochv\u00edl (1994) surveyed 200 women and found that 6% reported ejaculating, an additional 13% had some experience and about 60% reported release of fluid without actual gushing.[15] Reports on the volume of fluid expelled vary considerably, starting from amounts that would be imperceptible to a woman, to mean values of 1\u20135 ml.[16].The suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women's health writer Rebecca Chalker as \"one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology\".[17] Female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical, medical, and biological literature throughout recorded history.The reasons for the interest in female ejaculation have been questioned by feminist writers.[18].In the 16th century, the Dutch physician Laevinius Lemnius, referred to how a woman \"draws forth the man's seed and casts her own with it\".[19] In the 17th century, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriceau described glands at the female urethral meatus that \"pour out great quantities of saline liquor during coition, which increases the heat and enjoyment of women\".[20] This century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function,[21] in particular the work of the Bartholin family in Denmark..In the 17th century, the Dutch anatomist Reinier de Graaf wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs Concerning the Generative Organs of Women which is much cited in the literature on this topic.De Graaf discussed the original controversy but supported the Aristotelian view.[22][23] He identified the source as the glandular structures and ducts surrounding the urethra..", "Kanab ambersnail": "Oxyloma kanabense Pilsbry,1948.The Kanab ambersnail, formerly classified as Oxyloma haydeni kanabense or Oxyloma kanabense, is a small, air-breathing land snail belonging to the family Succineidae, the ambersnails.This terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusc was previously considered a critically endangered subspecies or species.In 2013, a scientific investigations report by the United States Geological Survey concluded that the Kanab ambersnail is not a genetically distinct species.[2] In June 2021, the Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Kanab ambersnail from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered mammals and birds and classified it with other common ambersnails within the same taxa, officially negating its status as a distinct subspecies.[3].The common name of the amber snails is based on the shell, which is translucent and when empty usually resembles the color of amber.[4].This snail is endemic to the United States, specifically the states of Arizona and Utah, where it was first collected in the early 20th century.This snail lives in wetlands, springs, and seeps,[5] and only two of its natural habitats are known to exist: Three Lakes, a meadow near Kanab, Utah, and Vasey's Paradise, a springs along the Colorado River within Grand Canyon National Park.[5] In its natural habitat it is rather polyphagous, feeding mainly on bacteria, plants and fungi.It reproduces during the summer..Previously considered a critically endangered species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species[6] due to a series of factors (including anthropic influence[7]), the Kanab ambersnail had been reintroduced to three springs above the historic high water level along the Colorado River..The snail had been listed as endangered on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species in 1991.In June 2021, following genetic testing that showed it was never a distinct subspecies, the Fish and Wildlife Service delisted the Kanab ambersnail from the federal endangered species list.[8].Specimens of the Kanab ambersnail were first collected in 1909 by James Ferriss from: \"The Greens\", 10 kilometers (6.2mi) above Kanab, Utah on Kanab Wash, on a wet ledge among moss and Cypripediums.[9] These specimens were originally thought to belong to the species Succinea hawkinsi.[5].", "Spanish language in the United States": "Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States.Over 42 million people aged five or older speak Spanish at home.[1] Spanish is also the most learned language other than English,[3] with about 8 million students.Estimates count up to 57 million native speakers, heritage language speakers, and second-language speakers.[4][5][6] There is an Academy of the Spanish Language located in the United States as well.[7].In the United States there are more speakers of Spanish than speakers of French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Hawaiian, the various varieties of Chinese, the Indo-Aryan languages, and the Native American languages combined.According to the 2022 American Community Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, Spanish is spoken at home by 42 million people aged five or older, more than twice as many as in 1990.[1].Spanish has been spoken in what is now the United States since the 15th century, with the arrival of Spanish colonization in North America.Colonizers settled in areas that would later become Florida, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California as well as in what is now the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.The Spanish explorers explored areas of 42 of the future US states leaving behind a varying range of Hispanic legacy in North America.Western regions of the Louisiana Territory were also under Spanish rule between 1763 and 1800, after the French and Indian War, which further extended Spanish influences throughout what is now the United States..After the incorporation of those areas into the United States in the first half of the 19th century, Spanish was later reinforced in the country by the acquisition of Puerto Rico in 1898.Waves of immigration from Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, El Salvador, and elsewhere in Latin America have strengthened the prominence of Spanish in the country.Today, Hispanics are one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, which has increased the use and importance of Spanish in the United States.", "Sic": "The Latin adverb sic (pronounced [s\u026ak]; \"thus\", \"just as\"; in full: sic erat scriptum, \"thus was it written\")[1] inserted after a quoted word or passage indicates that the quoted matter has been transcribed or translated exactly as found in the source text, complete with any erroneous, archaic, or otherwise nonstandard spelling, punctuation, or grammar.It also applies to any surprising assertion, faulty reasoning, or other matter that might be interpreted as an error of transcription..The typical usage is to inform the reader that any errors or apparent errors in quoted material do not arise from errors in the course of the transcription, but are intentionally reproduced, exactly as they appear in the source text.It is generally placed inside square brackets to indicate that it is not part of the quoted matter..Sic may also be inserted derisively or sarcastically, to call attention to the original writer's spelling mistakes or erroneous logic, or to show general disapproval or dislike of the material.[2].Though occasionally misidentified as an abbreviated word, sic is a Latin adverb used in English as an adverb, and, derivatively, as a noun and a verb.[3] The adverb sic, meaning \"intentionally so written\", first appeared in English c.\u20091856.[4] It is derived from the Latin adverb s\u012bc, which means \"so, thus, in this manner\".[5] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the verbal form of sic, meaning \"to mark with a sic\", emerged in 1889, E.Belfort Bax's work in The Ethics of Socialism being an early example.[6].On occasion, sic has been misidentified as an acronym (and therefore sometimes misspelled with periods): \"s.i.c.\" is said to stand for \"spelled/said in context\", \"said in copy\", \"spelling is correct\", \"spelled incorrectly\", and other such folk etymology phrases.[7] These are all incorrect and are simply backronyms from sic..Use of sic greatly increased in the mid-20th century.[8] For example, in United States state-court opinions before 1944, sic appeared 1,239 times in the Westlaw database; in those from 1945 to 1990, it appeared 69,168 times, over 55 times as many.[2] Its use as a form of ridicule has been cited as a major factor in this increase.[2] The immoderate use of sic has created some controversy, leading some editors, including bibliographical scholar Simon Nowell-Smith and literary critic Leon Edel, to speak out against it.[9].Sic, in its bracketed form, is most often inserted into quoted or reprinted material to indicate meticulous accuracy in reproducing the preceding text, despite appearances to the reader of an incorrect or unusual orthography (spelling, punctuation, grammar, syntax, fact, logic, etc.).[2][10] Several usage guides recommend that a bracketed sic be used primarily as an aid to the reader, not as an indicator of disagreement with the source.[2][11].Sic may show that an uncommon or archaic expression is reported faithfully,[12] such as when quoting the U.S.Constitution: \"The House of Representatives shall chuse [sic] their Speaker ...\" However, several writing guidebooks discourage its use with regard to dialect, such as in cases of American and British English spelling differences.[8][11][13] The appearance of a bracketed sic after the word analyse in a book review led Bryan A.", "List of Tokyo Mew Mew characters": "The Tokyo Mew Mew manga and anime series features a cast of characters designed by Mia Ikumi.The series takes place in Tokyo, Japan, where five adolescent girls, called Mew Mews, are infused with the DNA of endangered species to combat aliens attempting to take over the Earth.The manga series is followed by a short sequel series, Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode, which introduces a new Mew Mew and a new threat..The Mew Mews are led by the main character, Ichigo Momomiya, whose first task is to gather the other four Mew Mews: Minto Aizawa, Retasu Midorikawa, Bu-Ling Huang, and Zakuro Fujiwara.As the series progresses, Ichigo goes from having a crush on Masaya Aoyama to becoming his girlfriend while trying to hide her secret double life from him.The series antagonists include three aliens, Quiche, Pie, and Tart, and their leader, Deep Blue.Originally from Earth, the aliens were forced to leave long ago due to deadly environmental changes.They have returned to kill the humans, who they feel are destroying their planet, and reclaim the planet.In a la Mode, middle school student Berry Shirayuki is introduced as the sixth Mew Mew and, in the absence of Ichigo, the temporary leader of the Mew Mews.A la Mode also introduces new set of antagonists, the Saint Rose Crusaders, a group of human teenagers with various psychic abilities with a desire to create their own utopia.Led by Duke, they make several attempts to kill Berry, eventually turning the local populace against the Mew Mews..Ikumi's initial vision for Tokyo Mew Mew was a story called Tokyo Black Cat Girl that featured a cat-girl battling alien invaders.", "Sedimentary rock": "Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the accumulation or deposition of mineral or organic particles at Earth's surface, followed by cementation.Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause these particles to settle in place.The particles that form a sedimentary rock are called sediment, and may be composed of geological detritus (minerals) or biological detritus (organic matter).The geological detritus originated from weathering and erosion of existing rocks, or from the solidification of molten lava blobs erupted by volcanoes.The geological detritus is transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice or mass movement, which are called agents of denudation.Biological detritus was formed by bodies and parts (mainly shells) of dead aquatic organisms, as well as their fecal mass, suspended in water and slowly piling up on the floor of water bodies (marine snow).Sedimentation may also occur as dissolved minerals precipitate from water solution..The sedimentary rock cover of the continents of the Earth's crust is extensive (73% of the Earth's current land surface),[1] but sedimentary rock is estimated to be only 8% of the volume of the crust.[2] Sedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer over a crust consisting mainly of igneous and metamorphic rocks.Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers as strata, forming a structure called bedding.Sedimentary rocks are often deposited in large structures called sedimentary basins.Sedimentary rocks have also been found on Mars..The study of sedimentary rocks and rock strata provides information about the subsurface that is useful for civil engineering, for example in the construction of roads, houses, tunnels, canals or other structures.", "Human skeleton": "The human skeleton is the internal framework of the human body.It is composed of around 270 bones at birth \u2013 this total decreases to around 206 bones by adulthood after some bones get fused together.[1] The bone mass in the skeleton makes up about 14% of the total body weight (ca.10\u201311kg for an average person) and reaches maximum mass between the ages of 25 and 30.[2] The human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton.The axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column, the rib cage, the skull  and other associated bones.The appendicular skeleton, which is attached to the axial skeleton, is formed by the shoulder girdle, the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limbs..The human skeleton performs six major functions: support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of minerals, and endocrine regulation..The human skeleton is not as sexually dimorphic as that of many other primate species, but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull, dentition, long bones, and pelvis exist.In general, female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population.The human female pelvis is also different from that of males in order to facilitate childbirth.[3] Unlike most primates, human males do not have penile bones.[4].The axial skeleton (80 bones) is formed by the vertebral column (32\u201334 bones; the number of the vertebrae differs from human to human as the lower 2 parts, sacral and coccygeal bone may vary in length), a part of the rib cage (12 pairs of ribs and the sternum), and the skull (22 bones and 7 associated bones)..The upright posture of humans is maintained by the axial skeleton, which transmits the weight from the head, the trunk, and the upper extremities down to the lower extremities at the hip joints.The bones of the spine are supported by many ligaments.", "Saint Patrick": "Saint Patrick (Latin: Patricius; Irish: P\u00e1draig [\u02c8p\u02e0\u0251\u02d0\u027e\u02e0\u026a\u025f] or [\u02c8p\u02e0a\u02d0d\u032a\u02e0\u027e\u02e0\u0259\u025f]; Welsh: Padrig) was a fifth-century Romano-British Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland.Known as the \"Apostle of Ireland\", he is the primary patron saint of Ireland, the other patron saints being Brigid of Kildare and Columba.Patrick was never formally canonised,[2] having lived before the current laws of the Catholic Church in these matters.Nevertheless, he is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, the Lutheran Church, the Church of Ireland (part of the Anglican Communion), and in the Eastern Orthodox Church, where he is regarded as equal-to-the-apostles and Enlightener of Ireland.[3][4].The dates of Patrick's life cannot be fixed with certainty, but there is general agreement that he was active as a missionary in Ireland during the fifth century.A recent biography[5] on Patrick shows a late fourth-century date for the saint is not impossible.[6] According to tradition dating from the early Middle Ages, Patrick was the first bishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland, and is credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland, converting a pagan society in the process.He has been generally so regarded ever since, despite evidence of some earlier Christian presence.[7].According to Patrick's autobiographical Confessio, when he was about sixteen, he was captured by Irish pirates from his home in Britain and taken as a slave to Ireland.He writes that he lived there for six years as an animal herder before escaping and returning to his family.After becoming a cleric, he returned to spread Christianity in northern and western Ireland.In later life, he served as a bishop, but little is known about where he worked.By the seventh century, he had already come to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland..", "North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina": "North Myrtle Beach is a city in Horry County, South Carolina, United States.It was created in 1968 from four existing municipalities, and is located about 15 miles (24km) northeast of Myrtle Beach.It serves as one of the primary tourist destinations along the Grand Strand.As of the 2010 census, the population was 13,752,[6] and in 2019 the estimated population was 16,819.[7] It is part of the Myrtle Beach-Conway-North Myrtle Beach, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a combined population of 449,295 as of 2016.[8].In 1737, William Gause obtained a grant to 250 acres (100ha) of land near Windy Hill Beach.He farmed the area and also established a tavern for travelers along the Kings Highway.[9].North Myrtle Beach was created in 1968 with the consolidation of Cherry Grove Beach, Crescent Beach, Ocean Drive Beach, and Windy Hill Beach.[10].North Myrtle Beach is located in eastern Horry County.It is bordered to the southwest by Briarcliffe Acres and to the northeast by Little River.Via U.S.Route 17, it is 15 miles (24km) northeast of Myrtle Beach and 57 miles (92km) southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina.Via South Carolina Highway 9 it is 67 miles (108km) southeast of Interstate 95 near Dillon, South Carolina..", "World War I": "World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War or the Great War in historical contexts, was a global conflict from 1914 to 1918.It was fought between two coalitions, the Allied Powers and the Central Powers.Fighting took place throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia.One of the deadliest wars in history, it resulted in an estimated 9 million soldiers dead and 23 million wounded, plus another 5 million civilian deaths from various causes.Millions more died as a result of genocide, and the war was a major factor in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic..The first decade of the 20th century saw increasing diplomatic tension between the European great powers.This reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July.Russia came to Serbia's defence, and by 4 August, Germany, France, and Britain were drawn into the war, with the Ottoman Empire joining in November of that same year..Germany's strategy in 1914 was to first defeat France, then transfer forces to the Russian front.However, this failed, and by the end of 1914, the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland.The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives.", "Camden, New Jersey": "Camden is a city in and the county seat of Camden County, in the U.S.state of New Jersey.Camden is part of the Delaware Valley (Philadelphia metropolitan area)[21] and is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, the nation's sixth most populous city.At the 2020 United States census, Camden was the 14th-most populous municipality in the state,[22] with a population of 71,791,[10][11] a decrease of 5,553 (\u22127.2%) from the 2010 census count of 77,344, when it had been ranked 12th in the state by population (falling behind both Brick Township and nearby Cherry Hill),[23][24] which in turn reflected a decline of 1,984 (-2.5%) from the 79,318 counted in the 2000 census.[25][26] The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program calculated that the population was 70,996 in 2022,[10] making it the 528th-most-populous in the country.[12] The city was incorporated on February 13, 1828.[27] Camden has been the county seat of Camden County[28] since the county was formed on March 13, 1844.[27] The city derives its name from Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden.[29][30] Camden is made up of over 20 neighborhoods.[31][32][33][34] The city is part of the South Jersey region of the state..Beginning in the early 1900s, Camden was a prosperous industrial city, and remained so throughout the Great Depression and World War II.During the 1950s, Camden manufacturers began gradually closing their factories and moving out of the city.With the loss of manufacturing jobs came a sharp population decline.The growth of the interstate highway system also played a large role in suburbanization, which resulted in white flight.Civil unrest and crime became common in Camden.In 1971, civil unrest reached its peak, with riots breaking out in response to the death of Horacio Jimenez, a Puerto Rican motorist who was killed by two police officers.[35].The Camden waterfront holds three tourist attractions: the USS New Jersey, the Freedom Mortgage Pavilion, and the Adventure Aquarium.[36] The city is the home of Rutgers University\u2013Camden, which was founded as the South Jersey Law School in 1926,[37] and Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, which opened in 2012.Camden also houses both Cooper University Hospital and Virtua Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center.", "Amitriptyline": "Amitriptyline, sold under the brand name Elavil among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, a variety of pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, migraine and tension headaches.[11] Due to the frequency and prominence of side effects, amitriptyline is generally considered a.second-line therapy for these indications.[12][13][14][15].The most common side effects are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain.Of note is sexual dysfunction, observed primarily in males.Glaucoma, liver toxicity and abnormal heart rhythms are rare but serious side effects.Blood levels of amitriptyline vary significantly from one person to another,[16] and amitriptyline interacts with many other medications potentially aggravating its side effects..Amitriptyline was discovered in the late 1950s by scientists at Merck and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1961.[17] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[18] It is available as a generic medication.[19] In 2020, it was the 81st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9million prescriptions.[20][21].Amitriptyline is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder and neuropathic pain and for the prevention of migraine and chronic tension headache.It can be used for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children older than 6 after other treatments have failed.[11].Amitriptyline is effective for depression,[22] but it is rarely used as a first-line antidepressant due to its higher toxicity in overdose and generally poorer tolerability.[23] It can be tried for depression as a second-line therapy, after the failure of other treatments.[12] For treatment-resistant adolescent depression[24] or for cancer-related depression[25] amitriptyline is no better than placebo, however the number of treated patients in both studies was small.It is sometimes used for the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease,[26] but supporting evidence for that is lacking.[27].Amitriptyline alleviates painful diabetic neuropathy.", "Computer": "A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically.Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation.This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster..A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems.Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones.Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users..Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations.Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times.Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms.More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century.", "Barefoot and pregnant": "\"Barefoot and pregnant\" is a figure of speech most commonly associated with the idea that women should not work outside the home and should have many children during their reproductive years..The phrase \"barefoot and pregnant\" seems to have been introduced in the early twentieth century by the American doctor Arthur E.Hertzler from Kansas, who said: \"Some vulgar person has said that when the wife is kept barefooted and pregnant there are no divorces.\"[1] By the mid 20th century, the phrase had passed into common parlance, so much so that an article from 1949 states: \"By early 1949, TWA was\u2014in the words of its new president, Ralph S.Damon\u2014both 'barefoot and pregnant.'\"[2].The variation \"barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen\" has been associated with the phrase \"Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche\" (translated \"children, kitchen, church\"), used under the German Empire to describe a woman's role in society.A comparable phrase, \"Good Wife, Wise Mother\", emerged in Meiji-period Japan (1868\u20131912).[3][4].A common assumption is that the expression relates to housewives not leaving the home, and thus not needing shoes.Indeed, in the sex discrimination case of Volovsek v.Wisconsin Dept.of Agric., No.02-2074 (7th Cir.September 18, 2003), the United States Court of Appeals

census-designated place[9] (CDP) within Ocean Township, in Monmouth County, in the U.S.state of New Jersey.[10][11] As of the 2010 United States Census, the CDP's population was 3,995.[12].According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of 1.614 square miles (4.178km2), including 1.611 square miles (4.171km2) of land and 0.003 square miles (0.006km2) of water (0.16%).[5][13] The CDP also has an elevation of 46 feet above sea level..The 2010 United States census counted 3,995 people, 1,372 households, and 1,125 families in the CDP.The population density was 2,480.5 per square mile (957.7/km2).There were 1,473 housing units at an average density of 914.6 per square mile (353.1/km2).The racial makeup was 94.64% (3,781) White, 1.35% (54) Black or African

1828\u2013 February 24, 1914)[1][2] was an American college professor from Maine who volunteered during the American Civil War to join the Union Army.He became a highly respected and decorated Union officer, reaching the rank of brigadier general (and brevet major general).He is best known for his gallantry at the Battle of Gettysburg, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor..Chamberlain was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862, and fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg.He became commander of the regiment in June 1863 when losses at the Battle of Chancellorsville elevated the original commander, Colonel Adelbert Ames, to brigade command.[3] During the second day's fighting at Gettysburg on July 2, Chamberlain's regiment occupied the extreme left of the Union lines at Little Round Top.Chamberlain's men withstood repeated assaults from the 15th Alabama Infantry Regiment and finally drove the Confederates away with a downhill bayonet charge.Chamberlain was severely wounded while commanding a brigade during the Second Battle of Petersburg in June 1864, and was given what was intended to be a deathbed promotion to brigadier general.In April 1865, he fought at the Battle of Five Forks and was given the honor of commanding the Union troops at the surrender ceremony for the infantry of Robert E.Lee's Army at Appomattox Court House, Virginia..After the war, he entered politics as a Republican and served four one-year terms of office as the 32nd Governor of Maine from 1867 to 1871.After leaving office, he returned to his alma mater, Bowdoin College, serving as its president until 1883.He died in 1914 at age 85 due to complications from the wound that he received at Petersburg..", "Innings": "An innings is one of the divisions of a cricket match during which one team takes its turn to bat.Innings also means the period in which an individual player bats (acts as either striker or nonstriker).In cricket and rounders, \"innings\" is both singular and plural; this contrasts with baseball and softball in which the singular is \"inning\"..The earliest known record of the term concerns a match in August 1730 at Blackheath, Kent between a Kent side and London Cricket Club.The London-based St.James Evening Post reported: \"'Twas thought that the Kentish champions would have lost their honours by being beat at one innings if time had permitted\".[1][2].An innings is one of the divisions of a match during which one team takes its turn to bat, and is said to be \"in to bat\".[3][4] Innings is the subject of Law 13 in the Laws of Cricket.[5].The term is also used with the meaning of \"score\" for both the team and each individual batsman.For example, it may be said that \"he played an innings of 101\", meaning that the player scored 101 runs in his innings (while batting during one of the team's innings).Similarly, it may be said that the team had a first innings (score) of 501.[5].The term can generally be taken as a reference to the time during which someone possesses something and, colloquially, the phrase \"a good innings\" means a long life.[6][7].Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom

mutations in the ADA gene.It accounts for about 10\u201315% of all cases of autosomal recessive forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) among non-inbred populations.[1].ADA deficiency can present in infancy, childhood, adolescence, or adulthood.Age of onset and severity is related to some 29 known genotypes associated with the disorder.[2] It occurs in fewer than one in 100,000 live births worldwide..The main symptoms of ADA deficiency are pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes.Affected children also grow much more slowly than healthy children and some have developmental delay.Most individuals with ADA deficiency are diagnosed with SCID in the first 6 months of life.[citation needed].An association with polyarteritis nodosa has been reported.[3].The enzyme adenosine deaminase is encoded by the ADA gene on chromosome 20.[1] ADA deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 20 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder.The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.[citation needed].", "Poverty": "Poverty is a state or condition in which one lacks the financial resources and essentials for a certain standard of living.Poverty can have diverse social, economic, and political causes and effects.[1] When evaluating poverty in statistics or economics there are two main measures: absolute poverty compares income against the amount needed to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter;[2] relative poverty measures when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place.The definition of relative poverty varies from one country to another, or from one society to another.[2].Statistically, as of 2019[update], most of the world's population live in poverty: in PPP dollars, 85% of people live on less than $30 per day, two-thirds live on less than $10 per day, and 10% live on less than $1.90 per day.[3] According to the World Bank Group in 2020, more than 40% of the poor live in conflict-affected countries.[4] Even when countries experience economic development, the poorest citizens of middle-income countries frequently do not gain an adequate share of their countries' increased wealth to leave poverty.[5] Governments and non-governmental organizations have experimented with a number of different policies and programs for poverty alleviation, such as electrification in rural areas or housing first policies in urban areas.The international policy frameworks for poverty alleviation, established by the United Nations in 2015, are summarized in Sustainable Development Goal 1: \"No Poverty\"..Social forces, such as gender, disability, race and ethnicity, can exacerbate issues of poverty\u2014with women, children and minorities frequently bearing unequal burdens of poverty.Moreover, impoverished individuals are more vulnerable to the effects of other social issues, such as the environmental effects of industry or the impacts of climate change or other natural disasters or extreme weather events.Poverty can also make other social problems worse; economic pressures on impoverished communities frequently play a part in deforestation, biodiversity loss and ethnic conflict.For this reason, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and other international policy programs, such as the international recovery from COVID-19, emphasize the connection of poverty alleviation with other societal goals.[6].The word poverty comes from the old (Norman) French word povert\u00e9 (Modern French: pauvret\u00e9), from Latin paupert\u0101s from pauper (poor).[7].There are several definitions of poverty depending on the context of the situation it is placed in.It usually references a state or condition in which a person or community lacks the financial resources and essentials for a certain standard of living..", "Mushroom poisoning": "Mushroom poisoning is poisoning resulting from the ingestion of mushrooms that contain toxic substances.Symptoms can vary from slight gastrointestinal discomfort to death in about 10 days.Mushroom toxins are secondary metabolites produced by the fungus..Mushroom poisoning is usually the result of ingestion of wild mushrooms after misidentification of a toxic mushroom as an edible species.The most common reason for this misidentification is a close resemblance in terms of color and general morphology of the toxic mushrooms species with edible species.To prevent mushroom poisoning, mushroom gatherers familiarize themselves with the mushrooms they intend to collect, as well as with any similar-looking toxic species.The safety of eating wild mushrooms may depend on methods of preparation for cooking.Some toxins, such as amatoxins, are thermostable and mushrooms containing such toxins will not be rendered safe to eat by cooking..Poisonous mushrooms contain a variety of different toxins that can differ markedly in toxicity.Symptoms of mushroom poisoning may vary from gastric upset to organ failure resulting in death.Serious symptoms do not always occur immediately after eating, often not until the toxin attacks the kidney or liver, sometimes days or weeks later..The most common consequence of mushroom poisoning is simply gastrointestinal upset.", "Human height": "Human height or stature is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human body, standing erect.It is measured using a stadiometer,[1] in centimetres when using the metric system or SI system,[2][3] or feet and inches when using United States customary units or the imperial system.[4][5].In the early phase of anthropometric research history, questions about height techniques for measuring nutritional status often concerned genetic differences.[6].Height is also important because it is closely correlated with other health components, such as life expectancy.[6] Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature and a longer life expectancy.Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure and are less likely to acquire cancer.The University of Hawaii has found that the \"longevity gene\" FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of small body size.[7] Short stature decreases the risk of venous insufficiency.[8].When populations share genetic backgrounds and environmental factors, average height is frequently characteristic within the group.Exceptional height variation (around 20% deviation from average) within such a population is sometimes due to gigantism or dwarfism, which are medical conditions caused by specific genes or endocrine abnormalities.[9].The development of human height can serve as an indicator of two key welfare components, namely nutritional quality and health.[10] In regions of poverty or warfare, environmental factors like chronic malnutrition during childhood or adolescence may result in delayed growth and/or marked reductions in adult stature even without the presence of any of these medical conditions..The study of height is known as auxology.[11] Growth has long been recognized as a measure of the health of individuals, hence part of the reasoning for the use of growth charts.For individuals, as indicators of health problems, growth trends are tracked for significant deviations, and growth is also monitored for significant deficiency from genetic expectations.Genetics is a major factor in determining the height of individuals, though it is far less influential regarding differences among populations.", "Apollo 11": "Apollo 11 (July 16\u201324, 1969) was the American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon.Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC.Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing.Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds (21.5kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia in lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin Columbia..Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA's Apollo program.The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages\u2014a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit..After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit.Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20.The astronauts used Eagle's ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module.They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.[9] They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space..Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience.He described the event as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[a][15] Apollo 11 effectively proved U.S.", "Genocides in history": "Genocide is the deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or in part, of an ethnic, racial, religious, or national group.The term was coined in 1944 by Raphael Lemkin.It is defined in Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) of 1948 as \"any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group's conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\"[1].The preamble to the CPPCG states that \"genocide is a crime under international law, contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world\", and it also states that \"at all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity.\"[1].The debate continues over what legally constitutes genocide.One definition is any conflict that the International Criminal Court has so designated.Mohammed Hassan Kakar argues that the definition should include political groups or any group so defined by the perpetrator.[2] He prefers the definition from Frank Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn, which defines genocide as \"a form of one-sided mass killing in which a state or other authority intends to destroy a group so defined by the perpetrator.\"[3].In literature, some scholars have popularly emphasized the role that the Soviet Union played in excluding political groups from the international definition of genocide, which is contained in the Genocide Convention of 1948,[4] and in particular they have written that Joseph Stalin may have feared greater international scrutiny of the political killings that occurred in the country, such as the Great Purge;[5] however, this claim is not supported by evidence.The Soviet view was shared and supported by many diverse countries, and they were also in line with Raphael Lemkin's original conception,[a] and it was originally promoted by the World Jewish Congress.[7].Analysis of genocides before World War I is the result of modern studies that apply objectivity and fact, while previous accounts of genocides mostly aimed to emphasize one's own superiority.According to Frank Chalk, Helen Fein, and Kurt Jonassohn, if a dominant group of people had little in common with a marginalized group of people, it was easy for the dominant group to define the marginalized group as a subhuman group; the marginalized group might be labeled a threat that must be eliminated.[8].While the concept of genocide was formulated by Lemkin in the mid-20th century, the expansion of various European colonial powers, such as the British and the Spanish Empires, and the subsequent establishment of colonies on indigenous territory frequently involved acts of genocidal violence against indigenous groups in the Americas, Australia, Africa, and Asia.[9] According to Lemkin, colonization was in itself \"intrinsically genocidal\", and he saw this genocide as a two-stage process, the first being the destruction of the indigenous population's way of life.", "Timing

norms in the United States, including forms of speech, literature, music, visual arts, performing arts, food, sports, religion, law, technology as well as other customs, beliefs, and forms of knowledge.American culture has been shaped by the history of the United States, its geography, and various internal and external forces and migrations..Its Western foundations derive from  White settlement, and it was shaped early on by interactions with various indigenous groups and the forced migration of enslaved Africans.Since the United States was established in 1776, its culture has been influenced by successive waves of immigrants, and the resulting cultural diversity has been a distinguishing feature of society in the United States.The United States is a primarily anglophone country with a legal system derived from English common law.[1].Culture in the United States can vary by factors such as region, race and ethnicity, age, religion, socio-economic status, or population density, among others.Different aspects of American culture can be thought of as low culture or high culture, or belonging to any of a variety of subcultures..The United States exerts major cultural influence on a global scale and is considered a cultural superpower.[2][3].The European roots of the United States originate with the English and Spanish settlers of colonial North America during British and Spanish rule.The varieties of English people, as opposed to the other peoples on the British Isles, were the overwhelming majority ethnic group in the 17th century (the population of the colonies in 1700 was 250,000) and were 47.9% of percent of the total population of 3.9 million.They constituted 60% of the whites at the first census in 1790 (%: 3.5 Welsh, 8.5 Scotch Irish, 4.3 Scots, 4.7 Irish, 7.2 German, 2.7 Dutch, 1.7 French and 2 Swedish).[4] The English ethnic group contributed to the major cultural and social mindset and attitudes that evolved into the American character.Of the total population in each colony, they numbered from 30% in Pennsylvania to 85% in Massachusetts.[5] Large non-English immigrant populations from the 1720s to 1775, such as the Germans (100,000 or more), Scotch Irish (250,000), added enriched and modified the English cultural substrate.[6] The religious outlook was some versions of Protestantism (1.6% of the population were English, German and Irish Catholics)..", "Samoan language": "Samoan (Gagana fa\u02bba S\u0101moa or Gagana S\u0101moa; IPA: [\u014ba\u02c8\u014bana \u02c8sa\u02d0m\u028aa]) is a Polynesian language spoken by Samoans of the Samoan Islands.Administratively, the islands are split between the sovereign country of Samoa and the United States territory of American Samoa.It is an official language, alongside English, in both jurisdictions.It is widely spoken across the Pacific region, heavily so in New Zealand and also in Australia and the United States.Among the Polynesian languages, Samoan is the most widely spoken by number of native speakers..Samoan is spoken by approximately 260,000 people in the archipelago and with many Samoans living in diaspora in a number of countries, the total number of speakers worldwide was estimated at 510,000 in 2015.It is the third-most widely spoken language in New Zealand, where 2.2% of the population, 101,900 people, were able to speak it as of 2018.[2].The language is notable for the phonological differences between formal and informal speech as well as a ceremonial form used in Samoan oratory..Samoan is an analytic, isolating language and a member of the Austronesian family, and more specifically the Samoic branch of the Polynesian subphylum.It is closely related to other Polynesian languages with many shared cognate words such as ali\u02bbi, \u02bbava, atua, tapu and numerals as well as in the name of gods in mythology..Linguists differ somewhat on the way they classify Samoan in relation to the other Polynesian languages.[3] The \"traditional\" classification,[4] based on shared innovations in grammar and vocabulary, places Samoan with Tokelauan, the Polynesian outlier languages and the languages of Eastern Polynesia, which include Rapanui, M\u0101ori, Tahitian and Hawaiian.Nuclear Polynesian and Tongic (the languages of Tonga and Niue) are the major subdivisions of Polynesian under this analysis.", "Glucose tolerance test": "The glucose tolerance test (GTT, not to be confused with GGT test) is a medical test in which glucose is given and blood samples taken afterward to determine how quickly it is cleared from the blood.[1] The test is usually used to test for diabetes, insulin resistance, impaired beta cell function,[2] and sometimes reactive hypoglycemia and acromegaly, or rarer disorders of carbohydrate metabolism.In the most commonly performed version of the test, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a standard dose of glucose is ingested by mouth and blood levels are checked two hours later.[3] Many variations of the GTT have been devised over the years for various purposes, with different standard doses of glucose, different routes of administration, different intervals and durations of sampling, and various substances measured in addition to blood glucose..The glucose tolerance test was first described in 1923 by Jerome W.Conn.[4].The test was based on the previous work in 1913 by A.T.B.Jacobson in determining that carbohydrate ingestion results in blood glucose fluctuations,[5] and the premise (named the Staub-Traugott Phenomenon after its first observers H.Staub in 1921 and K.Traugott in 1922) that a normal patient fed glucose will rapidly return to normal levels of blood glucose after an initial spike, and will see improved reaction to subsequent glucose feedings.[6][7].Since the 1970s, the World Health Organization and other organizations interested in diabetes agreed on a standard dose and duration.[8].The patient is instructed not to restrict carbohydrate intake in the days or weeks before the test.[9] The test should not be done during an illness, as results may not reflect the patient's glucose metabolism when healthy.", "What About Me (song)": "", "Egg (food)": "Humans and their hominid ancestors have consumed eggs for millions of years.[1] The most widely consumed eggs are those of fowl, especially chickens.People in Southeast Asia began harvesting chicken eggs for food by 1500 BCE.[2] Eggs of other birds, such as ducks and ostriches, are eaten regularly but much less commonly than those of chickens.People may also eat the eggs of reptiles, amphibians, and fish.Fish eggs consumed as food are known as roe or caviar..Chickens and other egg-laying creatures are raised throughout the world, and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry.In 2009, an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens.[3] There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation, as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production.In 2012, the European Union banned battery husbandry of chickens..Bird eggs have been valuable foodstuffs since prehistory, in both hunting societies and more recent cultures where birds were domesticated.The chicken was most likely domesticated for its eggs (from jungle fowl native to tropical and subtropical Southeast Asia and Indian subcontinent) before 7500 BCE.Chickens were brought to Sumer and Egypt by 1500 BCE, and arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the quail had been the primary source of eggs.[4] In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, dating to approximately 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs, presumably those of the pelican, as offerings.[5] In ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods and meals often started with an egg course.[5] The Romans crushed the shells in their plates to prevent evil spirits from hiding there.[6].In the Middle Ages, eggs were forbidden during Lent because of their richness,[6] although the motivation for forgoing eggs during Lent was not entirely religious.An annual pause in egg consumption allowed farmers to rest their flocks, and also to limit their hens' consumption of feed during a time of year when food stocks were usually scarce..", "Major League Soccer": "Major League Soccer (MLS) is a men's professional soccer league sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation, which represents the sport's highest level in the United States.[2][3] The league comprises 29 teams\u201426 in the U.S.and 3 in Canada\u2014since the 2023 season.[4][5] The league is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan..Major League Soccer is the most recent in a series of men's premier professional national soccer leagues established in the United States and Canada.The predecessor of MLS was the North American Soccer League (NASL), which existed from 1968 until 1984.[6] MLS was founded in 1993 as part of the United States' successful bid to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[7] The inaugural season took place in 1996 with ten teams.[8] MLS experienced financial and operational struggles in its first few years, losing millions of dollars and folding two teams in 2002.[9] Since then, developments such as the proliferation of soccer-specific stadiums around the league, implementation of the Designated Player Rule allowing teams to sign star players such as David Beckham, and national TV contracts have made MLS profitable.[10] In 2022, with an average attendance of over 21,000 per game, MLS has the fourth-highest average attendance of any major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada after the National Football League (NFL) with over 69,000 fans per game,[11] Major League Baseball (MLB) with over 26,000 fans per game,[12] and the Canadian Football League (CFL) with nearly 23,000 fans per game.[13] MLS was the seventh-highest attended professional soccer league worldwide by 2013.[14].The MLS regular season typically starts in late February or early March and runs through mid-October, with each team playing 34games;[15][16] the team with the best record is awarded the Supporters' Shield.Eighteen teams compete in the postseason MLS Cup Playoffs in late October and November, culminating in the league's championship game, the MLS Cup.[17].Instead of operating as an association of independently owned clubs, MLS is a single entity in which each team is owned by the league and individually operated by the league's investors.[18] The league has a fixed membership like most sports leagues in the United States and Canada, which makes it one of the few soccer leagues that does not use a promotion and relegation process.[19].LA Galaxy have the most MLS Cups, with five.They are also tied with D.C.United for most Supporters' Shields, with four each.Los Angeles FC are the defending champions, as they defeated Philadelphia Union 3\u20130 on penalties in MLS Cup 2022 on November 5, 2022, to mark the end of the 2022 season..Major League Soccer's regular season runs from late February or early March to October.", "Legality of cannabis": "The legality of cannabis for medical and recreational use varies by country, in terms of its possession, distribution, and cultivation, and (in regards to medical) how it can be consumed and what medical conditions it can be used for.These policies in most countries are regulated by three United Nations treaties: the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.[1][2] Since its descheduling in 2020, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug under the Single Convention treaty, meaning that signatories can allow medical use but that it is considered to be an addictive drug with a serious risk of abuse.[3][4].The use of cannabis for recreational purposes is prohibited in most countries; however, many have adopted a policy of decriminalization to make simple possession a non-criminal offense (often similar to a minor traffic violation).Others have much more severe penalties such as some Asian and Middle Eastern countries where possession of even small amounts is punished by imprisonment for several years.[5] Countries that have legalized recreational use of cannabis are Canada, Georgia, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, and Uruguay, plus 24 states, 3 territories, and the District of Columbia in the United States and the Australian Capital Territory in Australia.Commercial sale of recreational cannabis is legalized nationwide in three countries (Canada, Thailand, and Uruguay) and in all subnational U.S.jurisdictions that have legalized possession except Virginia and Washington, D.C.A policy of limited enforcement has also been adopted in many countries, in particular the Netherlands where the sale of cannabis is tolerated at licensed coffeeshops.[6].Countries that have legalized medical use of cannabis include Albania, Argentina, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Rwanda, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.Others have more restrictive laws that allow only the use of certain cannabis-derived pharmaceuticals, such as Sativex, Marinol, or Epidiolex.[7] In the United States, 38 states, 4 territories, and the District of Columbia have legalized the medical use of cannabis, but at the federal level its use remains prohibited.[8].On 21 July 2023 the Albanian Parliament voted 69\u201323 to legalize medical cannabis.[13].Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate.HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent

contraction (or heartbeat).It can refer to the cardiac atrium,[1] ventricle,[2] gall bladder,[3] or leg veins,[4] although if unspecified it usually refers to the left ventricle of the heart.EF is widely used as a measure of the pumping efficiency of the heart and is used to classify heart failure types.It is also used as an indicator of the severity of heart failure, although it has recognized limitations.[5].The EF of the left heart, known as the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), is calculated by dividing the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle per beat (stroke volume) by the volume of blood present in the left ventricle at the end of diastolic filling (end-diastolic volume).LVEF is an indicator of the effectiveness of pumping into the systemic circulation.The EF of the right heart, or right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), is a measure of the efficiency of pumping into the pulmonary circulation.A heart which cannot pump sufficient blood to meet the body's requirements (i.e., heart failure) will often, but not invariably, have a reduced ventricular ejection fraction.[6].In heart failure, the difference between heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, and heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction, is significant, because the two types are treated differently..Modalities applied to measurement of ejection fraction is an emerging field of medical mathematics and subsequent computational applications.The first common measurement method is echocardiography,[7][8] although cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),[8][9] cardiac computed tomography,[8][9] ventriculography and nuclear medicine (gated SPECT and radionuclide angiography)[8][10] scans may also be used.Measurements by different modalities are not easily interchangeable.[11] Historically, the gold standard for measurement of the ejection fraction was ventriculography,[12] but cardiac MRI is now considered the best method.[13] Prior to these more advanced techniques, the combination of electrocardiography and phonocardiography was used to accurately estimate ejection fraction.[14].", "California State Route 14": "State Route 14.State Route 14 (SR14) is a north\u2013south state highway in the U.S.state of California that connects Los Angeles to the northern Mojave Desert.The southern portion of the highway is signed as the Antelope Valley Freeway.Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5, Golden State Freeway) in the.the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Granada Hills and Sylmar[2] just immediately to the south of the border of the city of Santa Clarita.SR14's northern terminus is at U.S.Route 395 (US395) near Inyokern.Legislatively, the route extends south of I-5 to SR1 in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles; however, the portion south of the junction with I-5 has not been constructed.The southern part of the constructed route is a busy commuter freeway serving and connecting the cities of Santa Clarita, Palmdale, and Lancaster to the rest of the Greater Los Angeles area.The northern portion, from Vincent (south of Palmdale) to US395, is legislatively named the Aerospace Highway, as the highway serves Edwards Air Force Base, once one of the primary landing strips for NASA's Space Shuttle, as well as the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake that supports military aerospace research, development and testing.This section is rural, following the line between the hot Mojave desert and the forming Sierra Nevada mountain range.", "Blindness": "Visual or vision impairment (VI or VIP) is the partial or total inability of visual perception.For the former and latter case, the terms low vision and blindness respectively are often used.In the absence of treatment such as corrective eyewear, assistive devices, and medical treatment \u2013 visual impairment may cause the individual difficulties with normal daily tasks including reading and walking.[6] In addition to the various permanent conditions, fleeting temporary vision impairment, amaurosis fugax, may occur, and may indicate serious medical problems.[7][8][9].The most common causes of visual impairment globally are uncorrected refractive errors (43%), cataracts (33%), and glaucoma (2%).[1] Refractive errors include near-sightedness, far-sightedness, presbyopia, and astigmatism.[1] Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness.[1] Other disorders that may cause visual problems include age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal clouding, childhood blindness, and a number of infections.[10] Visual impairment can also be caused by problems in the brain due to stroke, premature birth, or trauma, among others.[11] These cases are known as cortical visual impairment.[11] Screening for vision problems in children may improve future vision and educational achievement.[12] Screening adults without symptoms is of uncertain benefit.[13] Diagnosis is by an eye exam.[2].The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of visual impairment is either preventable or curable with treatment.[1] This includes cataracts, the infections river blindness and trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uncorrected refractive errors, and some cases of childhood blindness.[14] Many people with significant visual impairment benefit from vision rehabilitation, changes in their environment, and assistive devices.[2].As of 2015[update], there were 940 million people with some degree of vision loss.[5] 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind.[1] The majority of people with poor vision are in the developing world and are over the age of 50 years.[1] Rates of visual impairment have decreased since the 1990s.[1] Visual impairments have considerable economic costs both directly due to the cost of treatment and indirectly due to decreased ability to work.[15].In 2010, the WHO definition for visual impairment was changed and now follows the ICD-11.The previous definition which used \"best corrected visual acuity\" was changed to \"presenting visual acuity\".This change was made as newer studies showed that best-corrected vision overlooks a larger proportion of the population who has visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive errors, and/or lack of access to medical or surgical treatment.[16].Distance vision impairment:.Near vision impairment:.Severely sight impaired.", "DMX (rapper)": "Earl Simmons (December 18, 1970 \u2013 April 9, 2021), known professionally as DMX, was an American rapper and actor.He is regarded as one of the most important figures of 2000s hip hop.[5] His music is characterized by his \"aggressive\" rapping style,[6] with his lyrical content varying from hardcore themes to prayers.[3][4].He began rapping in the early 1990s and released his debut album It's Dark and Hell Is Hot in 1998, to both critical acclaim and commercial success, selling 251,000 copies within its first week of release.[7][8] DMX released his best-selling album, ...And Then There Was X, in 1999, which included the hit single \"Party Up (Up in Here)\".His 2003 singles \"Where the Hood At?\" and \"X Gon' Give It to Ya\" were also commercially successful.He was the first artist to debut an album at No.1 five times in a row on the Billboard 200 charts.[9] DMX sold over 74 million records worldwide.[10].DMX was featured in films such as Belly, Romeo Must Die, Exit Wounds, Cradle 2 the Grave, and Last Hour.In 2006, he starred in the reality television series DMX: Soul of a Man, which was primarily aired on the BET cable television network.In 2003, he published a book of his memoirs titled E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX.[11].Earl Simmons was born on December 18, 1970, with various accounts giving his birthplace as either Baltimore, Maryland or Mount Vernon, New York.[12] He was the son of 19-year-old Arnett Simmons and 18-year-old Joe Barker.[13] Earl was Simmons' second child; she had given birth to a daughter, Bonita, two years prior, and later gave birth to one daughter, Shayla, and two stillborn sons.[2] His father, Barker, was an artist who painted watercolor paintings of street scenes to sell at local fairs.Barker moved to Philadelphia and was largely absent from his life.[14].As a child, Simmons suffered greatly from bronchial asthma, being taken to the emergency room almost nightly due to him waking up unable to breathe.[2][14] He was raised as a Jehovah's Witness but became disillusioned with the faith after an incident where he was hit by a drunk driver while crossing the street.", "Professional certification": "Professional certification, trade certification, or professional designation, often called simply certification or qualification, is a designation earned by a person to assure qualification to perform a job or task.Not all certifications that use post-nominal letters are an acknowledgement of educational achievement, or an agency appointed to safeguard the public interest..A certification is a third-party attestation of an individual's level of knowledge or proficiency in a certain industry or profession.They are granted by authorities in the field, such as professional societies and universities, or by private certificate-granting agencies.Most certifications are time-limited; some expire after a period of time (e.g., the lifetime of a product that required certification for use), while others can be renewed indefinitely as long as certain requirements are met.Renewal usually requires ongoing education to remain up-to-date on advancements in the field, evidenced by earning the specified number of continuing education credits (CECs), or continuing education units (CEUs), from approved professional development courses..Many certification programs are affiliated with professional associations, trade organizations, or private vendors interested in raising industry standards.Certification programs are often created or endorsed by professional associations, but are typically completely independent from membership organizations.Certifications are very common in fields such as aviation, construction, technology, environment, and other industrial sectors, as well as healthcare, business, real estate, and finance..According to The Guide to National Professional Certification Programs (1997) by Phillip Barnhart, \"certifications are portable, since they do not depend on one company's definition of a certain job\" and they provide potential employers with \"an impartial, third-party endorsement of an individual's professional knowledge and experience\".[1].Certification is different from professional licensure.In the United States, licenses are typically issued by state agencies, whereas certifications are usually awarded by professional societies or educational institutes.", "Bugs Bunny": "Bugs Bunny is a fictional character created in the late 1930s at Warner Bros.Cartoons (originally Leon Schlesinger Productions) and voiced originally by Mel Blanc.[4] Bugs is best known for his featured roles in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated short films, produced by Warner Bros.Earlier iterations of the character first appeared in Ben Hardaway's Porky's Hare Hunt (1938) and subsequent shorts before Bugs's definitive characterization debuted in Tex Avery's A Wild Hare (1940).[1] Bob Givens, Chuck Jones and Robert McKimson are credited for defining Bugs's design.[1].Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is characterized by his flippant, insouciant personality.He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a trickster, and his catchphrase \"Eh...What's up, doc?\".Through his popularity during the golden age of American animation, Bugs became an American cultural icon and Warner Bros.' official mascot.[5].Bugs starred in more than 160 short films produced between 1940 and 1964.[6] He has since appeared in feature films, television shows, comics, and other media.He has appeared in more films than any other cartoon character, is the ninth most-portrayed film personality in the world[7] and has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[8].According to Chase Craig, who wrote and drew the first Bugs Bunny comic Sunday pages and the first Bugs comic book, \"Bugs was not the creation of any one man; however, he rather represented the creative talents of perhaps five or six directors and many cartoon writers including Charlie Thorson.[9] In those days, the stories were often the work of a group who suggested various gags, bounced them around and finalized them in a joint story conference.\"[10] A Prototype Bugs rabbit with some of the personality of a finalized Bugs, though looking very different, was originally featured in the film Porky's Hare Hunt, released on April 30, 1938.It was co-directed by Ben \"Bugs\" Hardaway and an uncredited director Cal Dalton (who was responsible for the initial design of the rabbit).This cartoon has an almost identical plot to Avery's Porky's Duck Hunt (1937), which had introduced Daffy Duck.Porky Pig is again cast as a hunter tracking a silly prey who is more interested in driving his pursuer insane and less interested in escaping.", "Mucous membrane": "A mucous membrane or mucosa is a membrane that lines various cavities in the body of an organism and covers the surface of internal organs.It consists of one or more layers of epithelial cells overlying a layer of loose connective tissue.It is mostly of endodermal origin and is continuous with the skin at body openings such as the eyes, eyelids, ears, inside the nose, inside the mouth, lips, the genital areas, the urethral opening and the anus.Some mucous membranes secrete mucus, a thick protective fluid.The function of the membrane is to stop pathogens and dirt from entering the body and to prevent bodily tissues from becoming dehydrated..The mucosa is composed of one or more layers of epithelial cells that secrete mucus, and an underlying lamina propria of loose connective tissue.[1] The type of cells and type of mucus secreted vary from organ to organ and each can differ along a given tract.[2][3].Mucous membranes line the digestive, respiratory and reproductive tracts and are the primary barrier between the external world and the interior of the body; in an adult human the total surface area of the mucosa is about 400 square meters while the surface area of the skin is about 2 square meters.[4]:\u200a1\u200a Along with providing a physical barrier, they also contain key parts of the immune system and serve as the interface between the body proper and the microbiome.[2]:\u200a437.Some examples include:.Developmentally, the majority of mucous membranes are of endodermal origin.[5] Exceptions include the palate, cheeks, floor of the mouth, gums, lips and the portion of the anal canal below the pectinate line, which are all ectodermal in origin.[6][7].One of its functions is to keep the tissue moist (for example in the respiratory tract, including the mouth and nose).[2]:\u200a480\u200a  It also plays a role in absorbing and transforming nutrients.[2]:\u200a5,\u200a813\u200a   Mucous membranes also protect the body from itself.For instance, mucosa in the stomach protects it from stomach acid,[2]:\u200a384,\u200a797\u200a  and mucosa lining the bladder protects the underlying tissue from urine.[8] In the uterus, the mucous membrane is called the endometrium, and it swells each month and is then eliminated during menstruation.[2]:\u200a1019.Niacin[2]:\u200a876\u200a and vitamin A are essential nutrients that help maintain mucous membranes.[9].", "Master Sergeant": "A master sergeant is the military rank for a senior non-commissioned officer in the armed forces of some countries..The \u05e8\u05d1-\u05e1\u05de\u05dc \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df\u200e rav samal rishon (abbreviated \"rasar\", master sergeant) is a non-commissioned officer (\u05e0\u05d2\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd\u200e) rank in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).Because the IDF is an integrated force, they have a unique rank structure.IDF ranks are the same in all services (army, navy and air force).The ranks are derived from those of the paramilitary Haganah developed in the British Mandate of Palestine period to protect the Yishuv.This origin is reflected in the slightly compacted IDF rank structure.[1].Master sergeant is used by the Armed Forces of the Philippines as a non-commissioned officer rank.It is used by the Philippine Army, Philippine Air Force and the Philippine Marine Corps (under the Philippine Navy.The rank is below Senior master sergeant and above Technical sergeant..As of February 8, 2019, a new ranking classification for the Philippine National Police was adopted, eliminating confusion of old ranks.Master sergeant is one of the new classification for non-commissioned officer rank.The rank stands above the Police Staff sergeant and below the Police Senior master sergeant..", "Cake": "Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients and is usually baked.In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate and which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies..The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil, or margarine), a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder.Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients.Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts, or dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream, or syrups),[1] iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit..Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays.There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old.Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake..The term \"cake\" has a long history.The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word \"kaka\".[2].The ancient Greeks called cake \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 (plakous), which was derived from the word for \"flat\", \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (plakoeis).It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey.", "Tammy Faye Messner": "Tamara Faye Messner (n\u00e9e LaValley, formerly Bakker /\u02c8be\u026ak\u0259r/; March 7, 1942 \u2013 July 20, 2007) was an American evangelist.She co-founded the televangist program, The PTL Club with her husband Jim Bakker in 1974.[1] They had hosted their own puppet-show series for local programming in the early 1960s; Messner also had a career as a recording artist.[1] In 1978, she and Bakker built Heritage USA, a Christian theme park.[1].During her career Messner was noted for her eccentric and glamorous persona, as well as for moral views that diverged from those of many mainstream evangelists, particularly her advocacy for LGBT persons and reaching out to HIV/AIDS patients at the height of the AIDS epidemic.[2][3] She released three autobiographies during her lifetime, I Gotta Be Me in 1978,[4] Tammy: Telling it My Way in 1996,  and I Will Survive and You Will Too! in 2003.[5].Jim Bakker was indicted, convicted, and imprisoned on numerous counts of fraud and conspiracy in 1989, resulting in the dissolution of The PTL Club.[1] She divorced Bakker in 1992, while he was in prison, and married Roe Messner.[6] She was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1996, from which she suffered intermittently for over a decade before dying of the disease in 2007.[6].She was born Tamara Faye LaValley in International Falls, Minnesota, to Pentecostal preachers Rachel Minnie (n\u00e9e Fairchild; 1919\u20131992) and Carl Oliver LaValley,[7] who married in 1941.Shortly after she was born, a painful divorce soured her mother against ministers,[8] alienating her from the church.Both of her parents remarried, her mother to Fred Willard Grover, forming a large blended family, of which she was the eldest.[9].In 1960, she met Jim Bakker while they were students at North Central Bible College in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[10] Tammy Faye worked in a boutique for a time while Jim found work in a restaurant inside a department store in Minneapolis.They were married on April 1, 1961.The next year, they moved to South Carolina, where they began their ministry together, initially traveling around the United States; Jim preached, while Tammy sang songs and played the accordion.[9] In 1970, she gave birth to their daughter Tammy Sue \"Sissy\" Bakker, and in 1975 gave birth to their son Jamie Charles Bakker..Jim and Tammy had been involved with television from the time of their departure from Minneapolis until they moved to the Charlotte area via Virginia Beach, Virginia, where they were founding members of The 700 Club.[11][9] While in Portsmouth, they were hosts of the popular children's show Jim and Tammy.They then created a puppet ministry for children on Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), which ran from 1964 to 1973.[11].", "Cambria, Wisconsin": "Cambria is a village in Columbia County, Wisconsin, United States.The population was 767 at the 2010 census.It is part of the Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area..In 1844, two brothers, John and Samuel Langdon, settled on the site.Samuel P.Langdon built a sawmill on a branch of Duck Creek, the other opened a small stock of merchandise.They surveyed and platted four blocks, and called the village Florence.But the mill dominated the landscape in those days, and the settlement around it was called Langdon's Mills..The settlement had just begun when about fifty Welshmen, with their wives and children, came from North Wales, many from Dolwyddelan.Morris J.Rowlands, a son of one of the colonists, wrote in 1912,.Early in the summer of 1845 several families from North Wales met accidentally at Liverpool, England, seeking passage as immigrants to the United States of America.", "Public policy": "Public policy is an institutionalized proposal or a decided set of elements like laws, regulations, guidelines, and actions[1][2] to solve or address relevant and real-world problems, guided by a conception[3] and often implemented by programs.The implementation of public policy is known as public administration.Public policy can be considered to be the sum of a government's direct and indirect activities[4] and has been conceptualized in a variety of ways..They are created and/or enacted on behalf of the public typically by a government.Sometimes they are made by nonprofit organizations[5] or are made in co-production with communities or citizens,[6][7] which can include potential experts,[8][9][10] scientists, engineers and stakeholders or scientific data, or sometimes use[11][12] some of their results.They are typically made[how?] by policy-makers affiliated with (in democratic polities) currently elected politicians.Therefore, the \"policy process is a complex political process in which there are many actors: elected politicians, political party leaders, pressure groups, civil servants, publicly employed professionals, judges, non-governmental organizations, international agencies, academic experts, journalists and even sometimes citizens who see themselves as the passive recipients of policy.\"[13].A popular way of understanding and engaging in public policy is through a series of stages known as \"the policy cycle\", which was first discussed by the political scientist Harold Laswell in his book The Decision Process: Seven Categories of Functional Analysis, published in 1956.The characterization of particular stages can vary, but a basic sequence is agenda setting, policy formulation, legitimation, implementation, and evaluation.\"It divides the policy process into a series of stages, from a notional starting point at which policymakers begin to think about a policy problem to a notional end point at which a policy has been implemented and policymakers think about how successful it has been before deciding what to do next.\"[14].Officials considered as policymakers bear responsibility to reflect the interests of a host of different stakeholders.Policy design entails conscious and deliberate effort to define policy aims and map them instrumentally.", "Digestion": "Digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble food compounds into small water-soluble components so that they can be absorbed into the blood plasma.In certain organisms, these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream.Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down: mechanical and chemical digestion.The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes.Mechanical digestion takes place in the mouth through mastication and in the small intestine through segmentation contractions.In chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small compounds that the body can use..In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva.Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work, and electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl\u2212, HCO\u22123).About 30% of starch is hydrolyzed into disaccharide in the oral cavity (mouth).After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus.It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis.Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion.", "Henry VIII of England": "Henry VIII (28 June 1491\u2013 28 January 1547) was King of England from 22 April 1509 until his death in 1547.Henry is best known for his six marriages, and his efforts to have his first marriage (to Catherine of Aragon) annulled.His disagreement with Pope Clement VII about such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation, separating the Church of England from papal authority.He appointed himself Supreme Head of the Church of England and dissolved convents and monasteries, for which he was excommunicated by the pope..Henry is known for his radical changes to the Constitution of England, expanding royal power and ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings in opposition to papal supremacy.He frequently used charges of treason and heresy to quell dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial using bills of attainder.He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour.Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in his administration..Henry was an extravagant spender, using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament.He converted the money that was formerly paid to Rome into royal revenue.Despite the money from these sources, he was often on the verge of financial ruin due to personal extravagance as well as costly and largely unproductive wars, particularly with King Francis I of France, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, King James V of Scotland and the Scottish regency under the Earl of Arran and Mary of Guise.He expanded the Royal Navy, oversaw the annexation of Wales to England with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland following the Crown of Ireland Act 1542..", "Bongo drum": "Bongos (Spanish: bong\u00f3) are an Afro-Cuban percussion instrument consisting of a pair of small open bottomed hand drums of different sizes.[1] The pair consists of the larger hembra (lit.\u2009'female') and the smaller macho (lit.\u2009'male'), which are joined by a wooden bridge.They are played with both hands and usually held between the legs, although in some cases, as in classical music, they may be played with sticks or mounted on stands..Bongos are mainly employed in the rhythm section of son cubano and salsa ensembles, often alongside other drums such as the larger congas and the stick-struck timbales.In these groups, the bongo player is known as bongosero and often plays a continuous eight-stroke pattern called martillo (lit.\u2009'hammer') as well as more rhythmically free parts, providing improvisatory flourishes and rhythmic counterpoint.[2].Bongos originated in eastern Cuba at the end of the 19th century, possibly from a pair of larger drums such as the bok\u00fa.These older, larger bongos are known as bong\u00f3 del monte and played in chang\u00fc\u00ed.The smaller bongos used in son cubano were popular across Cuba by the 1910s and reached the concert halls of the eastern United States in the 1930s.By the 1940s, bongos and congas were sharing the stage as son ensembles grew in size and Latin music began to cross-pollinate with jazz and other genres.During the second half of the 20th century, bongos began to be played in a wide variety of genres, from bachata to Latin rock.[3].Bongo drums are about 20 centimetres (8in) high and have diameters of approximately 20 centimetres (8in) and 25 centimetres (10in).[4][5][6] The shells of the drums and the bridge (the small block that joins them) are usually made of wood, although fiberglass is also common.The heads are typically made of calfskin and attached to the shells via steel hardware that enables their tuning (lug tuning).Originally, metal tacks were used, so the skins had to be tightened by heating the skins with a flame and loosened with water or by striking them vigorously.[4][7] This method of tuning is still used for the traditional bongos used in chang\u00fc\u00ed.", "Books of the Bible": "A biblical canon is a set of texts (also called \"books\") which a particular Jewish or Christian religious community regards as part of the Bible..The English word canon comes from the Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd kan\u014dn, meaning \"rule\" or \"measuring stick\".The use of the word \"canon\" to refer to a set of religious scriptures was first used by David Ruhnken, in the 18th century.[1].Various biblical canons have developed through debate and agreement on the part of the religious authorities of their respective faiths and denominations.Some books, such as the Jewish\u2013Christian gospels, have been excluded from various canons altogether, but many disputed books are considered to be biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical by many, while some denominations may consider them fully canonical.Differences exist between the Hebrew Bible and Christian biblical canons, although the majority of manuscripts are shared in common..Different religious groups include different books in their biblical canons, in varying orders, and sometimes divide or combine books.The Jewish Tanakh (sometimes called the Hebrew Bible) contains 24 books divided into three parts: the five books of the Torah (\"teaching\"); the eight books of the Nevi'im (\"prophets\"); and the eleven books of Ketuvim (\"writings\").It is composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew.The Septuagint (in Koine Greek), which closely resembles the Hebrew Bible but includes additional texts, is used as the Christian Greek Old Testament, at least in some liturgical contexts.The first part of Christian Bibles is the Old Testament, which contains, at minimum, the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible but divided into 39 (Protestant) or 46 (Catholic) books (including deuterocanonical works) and ordered differently.The second part is the New Testament, containing 27 books: the four canonical gospels, Acts of the Apostles, 21 Epistles or letters and the Book of Revelation.", "Dred Scott v. Sandford": "Dred Scott v.Sandford,[a] 60 U.S.(19 How.) 393 (1857), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court that held the U.S.Constitution did not extend American citizenship to people of black African descent, and thus they could not enjoy the rights and privileges the Constitution conferred upon American citizens.[2][3] The decision is widely considered the worst in the Supreme Court's history, being widely denounced for its overt racism, perceived judicial activism, poor legal reasoning, and crucial role in the start of the American Civil War four years later.[4][5][6] Legal scholar Bernard Schwartz said that it \"stands first in any list of the worst Supreme Court decisions\".Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes called it the Court's \"greatest self-inflicted wound\".[7].The decision involved the case of Dred Scott, an enslaved black man whose owners had taken him from Missouri, a slave-holding state, into Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory, where slavery was illegal.When his owners later brought him back to Missouri, Scott sued for his freedom and claimed that because he had been taken into \"free\" U.S.territory, he had automatically been freed and was legally no longer a slave.Scott sued first in Missouri state court, which ruled that he was still a slave under its law.He then sued in U.S.federal court, which ruled against him by deciding that it had to apply Missouri law to the case.He then appealed to the U.S.", "Neighborhoods in Columbus, Ohio": "Columbus, the state capital and Ohio's largest city, has numerous neighborhoods within its city limits.Neighborhood names and boundaries are not officially defined.They may vary or change from time to time due to demographic and economic variables..Columbus's African American population is largely concentrated in neighborhoods northeast and southeast of Downtown Columbus, as well as areas immediately west and east of Downtown, such as Franklinton and the Near East.Native-born whites and assimilated ethnic Europeans are dispersed throughout the city, with higher concentrations in neighborhoods in the western half of Columbus, and areas immediately south and north of Downtown.Columbus has a growing immigrant population of Hispanics, Asians and Asian Americans, and Africans.In the far west side of Columbus, especially in the Hilltop, there is a notable and diverse Hispanic population, with people of Mexican descent being the largest of Hispanic groups.There is also a much smaller Hispanic population, mostly made up of Puerto Ricans, in Northeast neighborhoods such as Northland and North Linden, where there is also a significant Somali population.In the northeast part of the city,near the 161 and Tamarack area.In areas close to Ohio State University, there are significant populations with origins from India and China.[1].Downtown Columbus is the Central Business District of Columbus, Ohio.The area centers on the intersection of Broad and High streets, with the northeast corners being known simple as Broad & High by the surrounding businesses and media.Downtown as a whole encompasses all the area inside the inner belt and is home to most of the largest buildings in Columbus..", "Biologist": "A biologist is a scientist who conducts research in biology.[1][2] Biologists are interested in studying life on Earth, whether it is an individual cell, a multicellular organism, or a community of interacting populations.[1] They usually specialize in a particular branch (e.g., molecular biology, zoology, and evolutionary biology) of biology[3] and have a specific research focus (e.g., studying malaria or cancer).[4].Biologists who are involved in basic research have the aim of advancing knowledge about the natural world.[1] They conduct their research using the scientific method, which is an empirical method for testing hypotheses.[1][5] Their discoveries may have applications for some specific purpose such as in biotechnology, which has the goal of developing medically useful products for humans.[1][6].In modern times, most biologists have one or more academic degrees such as a bachelor's degree plus an advanced degree like a master's degree or a doctorate.[3][7][8] Like other scientists, biologists can be found working in different sectors of the economy such as in academia, nonprofits, private industry, or government.[9].Francesco Redi, the founder of biology, is recognized to be one of the greatest biologists of all time.[10] Robert Hooke, an English natural philosopher, coined the term cell, suggesting plant structure's resemblance to honeycomb cells.[11].Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace independently formulated the theory of evolution by natural selection, which was described in detail in Darwin's book On the Origin of Species, which was published in 1859.In it, Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes of descent with accumulated modification leading to divergence over long periods of time.The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology.[12] Separately, Gregor Mendel formulated in the principles of inheritance in 1866, which became the basis of modern genetics..In 1953, James D.Watson and Francis Crick described the basic structure of DNA, the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms,[13] building on the work of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, suggested that the structure of DNA was a double helix..Ian Wilmut led a research group that in 1996 first cloned a mammal from an adult somatic cell, a Finnish Dorset lamb named Dolly.[14][15][16][17].An undergraduate degree in biology typically requires coursework in molecular and cellular biology, development, ecology, genetics, microbiology, anatomy, physiology, botany, and zoology.[8][18] Additional requirements may include physics, chemistry (general, organic, and biochemistry), calculus, and statistics..Students who aspire to a research-oriented career usually pursue a graduate degree such as a master\u2019s or a doctorate (e.g., PhD) whereby they would receive training from a research head based on an apprenticeship model that has been in existence since the 1800s.[7] Students in these graduate programs often receive specialized training in a particular subdiscipline of biology.[3].", "BASE jumping": "BASE jumping (/be\u026as/) is the recreational sport of jumping from fixed objects, using a parachute to descend safely to the ground.\"BASE\" is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: buildings, antennae (referring to radio masts), spans (bridges), and earth (cliffs).[1][2] Participants exit from a fixed object such as a cliff, and after an optional freefall delay, deploy a parachute to slow their descent and land.A popular form of BASE jumping is wingsuit BASE jumping..In contrast to other forms of parachuting, such as skydiving from airplanes, BASE jumps are performed from fixed objects which are generally at much lower altitudes, and BASE jumpers only carry one parachute..BASE jumping is significantly more hazardous than other forms of parachuting, and is widely considered to be one of the most dangerous extreme sports.[3].Fausto Veranzio is widely believed to have been the first person to build and test a parachute,[4] by jumping from St Mark's Campanile in Venice in 1617 when he was over 65 years old.[5] However, these and other sporadic incidents were one-time experiments, not the actual systematic pursuit of a new form of parachuting..There are precursors to the sport dating back hundreds of years.[citation needed] In 1966, Michael Pelkey and Brian Schubert jumped from El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.[6] The acronym \"B.A.S.E.\" (now more commonly \"BASE\") was later coined by filmmaker Carl Boenish, his wife Jean Boenish, Phil Smith, and Phil Mayfield.[7] Carl Boenish was an important catalyst behind modern BASE jumping, and in 1978 he filmed jumps from El Capitan, made using ram-air parachutes and the freefall tracking technique.[8] While BASE jumps had been made prior to that time, the El Capitan activity was the effective birth of what is now called BASE jumping..After 1978, the filmed jumps from El Capitan were repeated, not as an actual publicity exercise or as a movie stunt, but as a true recreational activity.It was this that popularized BASE jumping more widely among parachutists.[9] Carl Boenish continued to publish films and informational magazines on BASE jumping until his death in 1984 after a BASE jump off the Troll Wall.By this time, the concept had spread among skydivers worldwide, with hundreds of participants making fixed-object jumps..During the early eighties, nearly all BASE jumps were made using standard skydiving equipment, including two parachutes (main and reserve), and deployment components.Later on, specialized equipment and techniques were developed specifically for the unique needs of BASE jumping..", "British Shorthair": "The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face.The most familiar colour variant is the \"British Blue\", with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a medium-sized tail.The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint..It is one of the most ancient cat breeds known.In modern times, it remains the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country, as registered by the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF).A quarter of all kittens registered with the GCCF each year are British Shorthairs, making the British the most popular pedigree cat in the UK.[1].The breed's good-natured appearance and relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star, notably as the inspiration for John Tenniel's famous illustration of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland.The Cat Fanciers' Association profile reads: \"When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile'.\"[2].The origins of the British Shorthair most likely date back to the first century AD, making it one of the most ancient identifiable cat breeds in the world.[citation needed] These cats were imported by the Romans who kept them to keep the camps clear of snakes, mice and insects..These cats then interbred with the local European wildcat population.Over the centuries, their naturally isolated descendants developed into distinctively large, robust cats with a short but very thick coat, to better withstand conditions on their native islands.Based on artists' representations, the modern British Shorthair is unchanged from this initial type.[3].", "United States men's national basketball team": "The USA Basketball Men's National Team,[2] commonly known as the United States men's national basketball team, is the basketball team representing the United States.They are the most successful team in international competition, winning medals in all nineteen Olympic tournaments it has entered, including sixteen golds.In the professional era, the team won the Olympic gold medal in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020.Two of its gold medal-winning teams were inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in August 2010: the 1960 team, which featured six Hall of Famers (4 players, 2 coaches), and the 1992 \"Dream Team\", featuring 14 Hall of Famers (11 players, 3 coaches).The team is currently ranked first in the FIBA World Rankings..Traditionally composed of amateur players, the US dominated the first decades of international basketball, winning a record seven consecutive Olympic gold medals.However, by the end of the 1980s, American amateurs were no longer competitive against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.[3][4][5][6].In 1989, FIBA modified its rules and allowed USA Basketball to field teams with National Basketball Association players.[7][8] The first such team, known as the \"Dream Team\", won the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, being superior in all matches.[9][10] With the introduction of NBA players, the team was able to spark a second run of dominance in the 1990s..Facing increased competition, the US failed to win a medal at the 2002 FIBA World Championship, finishing sixth.The 2004 Olympic team, being depleted by a number of withdrawals, lost three games on its way to a bronze medal, a record that represented more losses in a single year than the country's Olympic teams had suffered in all previous Olympiads combined..Determined to put an end to these failures, USA Basketball initiated a long-term project aimed at creating better, more cohesive teams.The US won its first seven games at the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan before losing against Greece in the semi-finals; ending the competition with the bronze medal.", "Super Bowl ring": "The Super Bowl ring is an award in the National Football League given to the team members of the winning team of the league's annual championship game, the Super Bowl.The Super Bowl ring offers a collectible memento for the actual players and team members to keep for themselves to symbolize their victory.[1] There are also rings provided to the runners-up team of the Super Bowl.[2].Rings are also awarded to members of the team which wins the AFC or NFC championship.[3][4][5] The NFL also provides postseason pay to all players as long as they have spent at least three games on their team's active or reserve list; the playoff bonus money is spread evenly within a team among starters, backups, and injured players.[6].These rings are typically made of yellow or rose gold with diamonds.They usually include the team name, team logo, the phrase, \"World Champions,\", and the Super Bowl number (usually indicated in Roman numerals).Many rings feature diamonds in the shape of the Vince Lombardi Trophy or a football, to illustrate the number of Super Bowls that the franchise has won.[7] Also, the rings are customized with the player's name and uniform number.The NFL contributes approximately $5,000-$7,000 per ring for up to 150 rings for the winning team; any additional costs are borne by the team.[8] Most rings are manufactured by memorabilia company Jostens.[citation needed] The rings often are normally presented in an elegant box and/or display case..The winning team can typically present any number of rings to whomever they choose, including usually, but not limited to: players (active roster, inactive roster, or injured reserve), coaches, trainers, executives, personnel, and general club staff.Some teams have given rings to former players and coaches that were on the team at some point during the season, despite not having been on the winning roster for the Super Bowl itself.[9][10] Sometimes a team will make rings available to fans as part of a charity raffle.[11] A recent trend over the last 15\u201320 years has been to present lesser-valued rings to non-player and front office staff.These are commonly called \"B\" and \"C\" level rings (while the player rings would be considered \"A\" rings) and are smaller and contain fewer diamonds or imitation diamonds.The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia stones (which resemble diamonds).When Tampa Bay won Super Bowl XXXVII, the players and coaches received \"A\" rings with a diamond-centered Lombardi trophy.[12] Some staff received rings with a metal Lombardi trophy substituted, with real diamonds surrounding the trophy, while the \"C\" level ring did not contain any diamonds.", "Stalagmite": "A stalagmite (UK: /\u02c8st\u00e6l\u0259\u0261\u02ccma\u026at/, US: /st\u0259\u02c8l\u00e6\u0261ma\u026at/; from Greek

trickling', and  -\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (-\u00edt\u0113s)'one connected to, a member of')[1].is a type of rock formation that rises from the floor of a cave due to the accumulation of material deposited on the floor from ceiling drippings.Stalagmites are typically composed of calcium carbonate, but may consist of lava, mud, peat, pitch, sand, sinter, and amberat (crystallized urine of pack rats).[2][3].The corresponding formation hanging down from the ceiling of a cave is a stalactite.Mnemonics have been developed for which word refers to which type of formation; one is that stalactite has a C for \"ceiling\", and stalagmite has a G for \"ground\",[4] another is that, as with ants in the pants, the mites go up and the tights (tites) come down..The most common stalagmites are speleothems, which usually form in limestone caves.[5] Stalagmite formation occurs only under certain pH conditions within the cavern.They form through deposition of calcium carbonate and other minerals, which is precipitated from mineralized water solutions.Limestone is the chief form of calcium carbonate rock,  which is dissolved by water that contains carbon dioxide, forming a calcium bicarbonate solution in caverns.[6] The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the water must be greater than the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the cave chamber for conventional stalagmite growth.[7].If stalactites \u2013 the ceiling formations \u2013 grow long enough to connect with stalagmites on the floor, they form a column..Stalagmites should normally not be touched, since the rock buildup is formed by minerals precipitating out of the water solution onto the existing surface; skin oils can alter the surface tension where the mineral water clings or flows, thus affecting the growth of the formation.Oils and dirt (mud, clay) from human contact can also stain the formation and change its color permanently..Another type of stalagmite is formed in lava tubes while molten and fluid lava is still active inside.", "List of How I Met Your Mother episodes": "How I Met Your Mother is an American sitcom written and created by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas.It was first aired on September 19, 2005 on CBS with a thirty-minute pilot episode, and finished its planned nine-year run on March 31, 2014.Set in present-day Manhattan, New York City, the series follows the social and romantic lives of Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) and his four best friends, Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), and Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), as Ted seeks out his future wife (Cristin Milioti).The show tells this story through the framing device of \"future\" Ted (Bob Saget) as an unreliable narrator who is recounting to his son and daughter the events that led him to their mother.[1] In Seasons 1\u20138, episodes are typically set to a similar timeline as its real-world airdate, with the season finale generally taking place in the spring and the next season premiere in the fall, usually with a quick recap of the events that took place during the summer.The final season (season 9) deviates from this format by taking place immediately after the end of the previous season and encompassing only the weekend of Barney's and Robin's wedding.[2][3] The series finale covers several years that follow..How I Met Your Mother premiered to nearly 11 million viewers[4] and maintained a generally steady viewership.[5] The first seven seasons are available on DVD in Region 1, 2, and 4, while the season eight DVD was released in Region 1 and 2 in October 2013.[6] In addition, all nine seasons are currently available for streaming on Hulu and Amazon Prime Video and can be purchased on the Apple TV app from the iTunes Store in the US and on Disney+ in Australia.[7].During the course of the series, 208 episodes of How I Met Your Mother aired over nine seasons..Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout

Spanish: [\u02c8\u0261\u027ei\u014b\u0261o], Portuguese: [\u02c8\u0261\u027e\u0129\u0261u]) (masculine) or gringa (feminine) is a term in Spanish and Portuguese for a foreigner, usually an English-speaking Anglo-American.There are differences in meaning depending on region and country.In Latin America, it is generally used to refer to non-Latin Americans.The term is often considered a pejorative,[1] but is not always used to insult,[2][3][4] and in the United States its usage and offensiveness is disputed.[5].The word derives from the term used by the Spanish for a Greek person: griego.[6][7] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first recorded use in English comes from John Woodhouse Audubon's Western Journal of 1849\u20131850,[8][9] in which Audubon reports that his party was hooted and shouted at and called \"Gringoes\" while passing through the town of Cerro Gordo, Veracruz.[10].The word gringo originally referred to any kind of foreigner.It was first recorded in 1787 in the Spanish Diccionario castellano con las voces de Ciencias y Artes:[11][12][a].GRINGOS, llaman en M\u00e1laga a los extranjeros, que tienen cierta especie de acento, que los priva de una locuci\u00f3n f\u00e1cil, y natural Castellana; y en Madrid dan el mismo, y por la misma causa con particularidad a los Irlandeses..Gringos is what, in Malaga, they call foreigners who have a certain type of accent that prevents them from speaking Castilian easily and naturally; and in Madrid they give the same name, and for the same reason, in particular to the Irish..The most likely theory is that it originates from griego ('Greek'), used in the same way as the English phrase \"it's Greek to me\".[6][13] Spanish is known to have used Greek as a stand-in for incomprehensibility, though now less common, such as in the phrase hablar en griego (lit.'to speak Greek').The 1817 Nuevo diccionario franc\u00e9s-espa\u00f1ol,[b] for example, gives gringo and griego as synonyms in this context:[14].", "Great white shark": "The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the white shark, white pointer, or simply great white, is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans.It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon.The great white shark is notable for its size, with the largest preserved female specimen measuring 5.83m (19.1ft) in length and around 2,000kg (4,410lb) in weight at maturity.[3] However, most are smaller; males measure 3.4 to 4.0m (11 to 13ft), and females measure 4.6 to 4.9m (15 to 16ft) on average.[4][5] According to a 2014 study, the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above previous estimates,[6] making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fishes currently known.[7] According to the same study, male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring.[8] Great white sharks can swim at speeds of 25km/h (16mph)[9] for short bursts and to depths of 1,200m (3,900ft).[10].The great white shark is arguably the world's largest-known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals, such as pinnipeds and dolphins.The great white shark is also known to prey upon a variety of other animals, including fish, other sharks, and seabirds.It has only one recorded natural predator, the orca.[11].The species faces numerous ecological challenges which has resulted in international protection.The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the great white shark as a vulnerable species,[1] and it is included in Appendix II of CITES.[12] It is also protected by several national governments, such as Australia (as of 2018).[13] Due to their need to travel long distances for seasonal migration and extremely demanding diet, it is not logistically feasible to keep great white sharks in captivity; because of this, while attempts have been made to do so in the past, there are no known aquariums in the world believed to house a live specimen.[14].The great white shark is depicted in popular culture as a ferocious man-eater, largely as a result of the novel Jaws by Peter Benchley and its subsequent film adaptation by Steven Spielberg.Humans are not a preferred prey,[15]  but nevertheless it is responsible for the largest number of reported and identified fatal unprovoked shark attacks on humans.[16] However, attacks are rare, typically occurring fewer than 10 times per year globally.[17][18].The great white is the sole recognized extant species in the genus Carcharodon, and is one of five extant species belonging to the family Lamnidae.[19] Other members of this family include the mako sharks, porbeagle, and salmon shark.The family belongs to the Lamniformes, the order of mackerel sharks.[20].", "United States armed forces": "The United States Armed Forces are the military forces of the United States.[13] The armed forces consists of six service branches: the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, and Coast Guard.[14][15] All six armed services are among the eight uniformed services of the United States.[16].Each of the different military services is assigned a role and domain.The Army conducts land operations, while the Navy and Marine Corps conduct maritime operations, with the Marine Corps specializing in amphibious and maritime littoral operations in support of the Navy.The Air Force conducts air operations, while the Space Force conducts space operations.The Coast Guard is unique in that it specializes in maritime operations and is also a law enforcement agency.[17][18].From their inception during the American Revolutionary War, the U.S.Armed Forces have played a decisive role in the country's history.They helped forge a sense of national unity and identity through victories in the early-19th-century First and Second Barbary Wars.They played a critical role in the territorial evolution of the U.S., including the American Civil War.The National Security Act of 1947 created the modern U.S.military framework, establishing the National Military Establishment (later the Department of Defense or DoD) headed by the secretary of defense and creating both the U.S.Air Force and National Security Council; in 1949, an amendment to the act merged the cabinet-level departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force into the DoD..", "Freedom of speech": "Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction.The right to freedom of expression has been recognised as a human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights law by the United Nations.Many countries have constitutional law that protects free speech.Terms like free speech, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression are used interchangeably in political discourse.However, in a legal sense, the freedom of expression includes any activity of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used..Article 19 of the UDHR states that \"everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference\" and \"everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice\".The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries \"special duties and responsibilities\" and may \"therefore be subject to certain restrictions\" when necessary \"[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others\" or \"[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals\".[2].Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, may not be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, hate speech, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, dignity, the right to be forgotten, public security, and perjury.Justifications for such include the harm principle, proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, which suggests that \"the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\".[3].The idea of the \"offense principle\" is also used to justify speech limitations, describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, and ease with which it could be avoided.[3] With the evolution of the digital age, application of freedom of speech becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise, for example, the Golden Shield Project, an initiative by Chinese government's Ministry of Public Security that filters potentially unfavourable data from foreign countries..The Human Rights Measurement Initiative[4] measures the right to opinion and expression for countries around the world, using a survey of in-country human rights experts.[5].Freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern international human rights instruments.[6] It is thought that the ancient Athenian democratic principle of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century BC.[7].", "List of The Big Bang Theory episodes": "The Big Bang Theory is an American comedy television series created and executively produced by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady for CBS.Like the name of the series itself (with the exception of the first episode \"Pilot\"), episode titles of The Big Bang Theory always start with \"The\" and resemble the name of a scientific principle, theory or experiment, whimsically referencing a plot point or quirk in that episode..During the course of the series, 279 episodes of The Big Bang Theory aired, between September 24, 2007, and May 16, 2019.There is also an earlier pilot, that differs greatly from the series, that never aired on CBS..All episodes have been released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Max..Main

"Dwight D. Eisenhower": "Dwight David Eisenhower (/\u02c8a\u026az\u0259nha\u028a.\u0259r/ EYE-z\u0259n-how-\u0259r; born David Dwight Eisenhower; October 14, 1890 \u2013 March 28, 1969), nicknamed Ike, was an American military officer and statesman who served as the 34th president of the United States from 1953 to 1961.During World War II, he served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe and achieved the five-star rank as General of the Army.Eisenhower planned and supervised two of the most consequential military campaigns of World War II:  Operation Torch in the North Africa campaign in 1942\u20131943 and the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944..Eisenhower was born into a large family of mostly Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry in Denison, Texas, and raised in Abilene, Kansas.His family had a strong religious background, and his mother became a Jehovah's Witness.Eisenhower, however, belonged to no organized church until 1952.He graduated from West Point in 1915 and later married Mamie Doud, with whom he had two sons.During World War I, he was denied a request to serve in Europe and instead commanded a unit that trained tank crews.Following the war, he served under various generals and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in 1941.After the United States entered World War II, Eisenhower oversaw the invasions of North Africa and Sicily before supervising the invasions of France and Germany.After the war ended in Europe, he served as military governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany (1945), Army Chief of Staff (1945\u20131948), president of Columbia University (1948\u20131953), and as the first supreme commander of NATO (1951\u20131952).He was also the last president to have been born in the nineteenth century..", "Air force one": "Air Force One is the official air traffic control designated call sign for a United States Air Force aircraft carrying the president of the United States.In common parlance, the term is used to denote U.S.Air Force aircraft modified and used to transport the president and a metonym for the primary presidential aircraft, VC-25, although it can be used to refer to any Air Force aircraft the president travels on.[1][2].The idea of designating specific military aircraft to transport the president arose during World War II when military advisors in the War Department were concerned about the risk of using commercial airlines for presidential travel.A C-54 Skymaster was then converted for presidential use; dubbed the Sacred Cow, it carried President Franklin D.Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference in February 1945 and was used for another two years by President Harry S.Truman.[citation needed].The \"Air Force One\" call sign was created in 1953, after a Lockheed Constellation carrying President Dwight D.Eisenhower entered the same airspace as a commercial airline flight using the same flight number.[3] Since the introduction of SAM 26000 in 1962, the primary presidential aircraft has carried the distinctive livery designed by Raymond Loewy.[4][5].Other aircraft designated as Air Force One have included another Lockheed Constellation, Columbine III, three Boeing 707s, introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, and the current Boeing VC-25As.Since 1990, the presidential fleet has consisted of two highly customized Boeing 747-200B (VC-25A) aircraft.[4] TheUSAF has ordered two Boeing 747-8s to serve as the next presidential aircraft, with designation VC-25B..On 11 October 1910, Theodore Roosevelt became the first US president to fly in an aircraft, an early Wright Flyer from Kinloch Field near St.", "Wedding anniversary": "A wedding anniversary is the anniversary of the date that a wedding took place.Couples often mark the occasion by celebrating their relationship, either privately or with a larger party.Special celebrations and gifts are often given for particular anniversary milestones (e.g., 10, 15, 20, or 25 years).In some cultures, traditional names exist for milestone anniversaries; for instance, fifty years of marriage may be known variously as a \"golden wedding anniversary\", \"golden anniversary\" or \"golden wedding\"..Associating a wedding anniversary with precious metals such  as \"gold\" (50 years) or \"silver\" (25 years) has been documented in Germanic countries since the 1500s.[1] In English-speaking countries, the tradition of associating gift-giving with wedding anniversaries became more prevalent in the nineteenth century.[2]  In the twentieth century, increased commercialization led to the inclusion of more anniversaries to a list of predetermined gifts.[3][4].In some parts of the world, couples can receive special recognition from government officials for particular milestones.In the Commonwealth realms, a couple can receive a message from the monarch for 60th, 65th and 70th wedding anniversaries and for any wedding anniversary after that.This is done by applying to Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom or to the governor-general's office in the other Commonwealth realms.[5].In Australia, couples can receive a congratulatory letter from the governor-general on the 50th and all subsequent wedding anniversaries.The prime minister, the Leader of the Opposition, local members of both state and federal parliaments as well as state governors may also send salutations for the same anniversaries.[6].In Canada, couples can also receive a message from the governor-general for the 50th anniversary and every fifth anniversary after that.[7].In the United States, a couple can receive an anniversary greeting card from the president for the 50th and all subsequent anniversaries.[8].", "Automatic Document Feeder": "In multifunction or all-in-one printers, fax machines, photocopiers and scanners, an automatic document feeder or ADF is a feature which takes several pages and feeds the paper one page at a time into a scanner or copier,[1] allowing the user to scan, and thereby copy, print, or fax, multiple-page documents without having to manually replace each page..Most copiers allow scanning on the flatbed or platen (the \"glass\") or through a document feeder.The vast majority of fax machines have an ADF, allowing the unattended sending of multi-page faxes.ADF is so ubiquitous in fax machines that some fax machine owners use the machine as a scanner, faxing multi-page documents to themselves.Document feeders are described by speed, in pages per minute or ppm, and capacity, usually in a range from 10 sheets to 200..There are two kinds of document feeders capable of two-sided (duplex) scanning: a reversing automatic document feeder or RADF scans one side of a page, then flips it and scans the other side.A duplexing automatic document feeder or DADF scans both sides in one pass.The advantage of the DADF is faster speed for two-sided originals.RADFs and DADFs are rated in images per minute (IPM), the number of sides they can scan each minute; this may depend upon the resolution being used (rather than the maximum resolution supported)..This computer hardware article is a stub.You can help Wikipedia by expanding it..Main pageContentsCurrent

277-acre (112ha) area is registered as a Dallas Landmark and National Historic Landmark; many of the buildings were constructed for the Texas Centennial Exposition in 1936..Fair Park has been designated a Great Place in America by the American Planning Association.[4].The site was established as an 80-acre (32ha) fairground on the outskirts of East Dallas for the Dallas State Fair in 1886.After a fire and financial loss by the fair association in 1904, voters approved the \"Reardon Plan.\"[5] It became Dallas' second public park, known as \"Fair Park.\".An important figure in Fair Park's development was landscape architect and city planner George Kessler.In 1906, he was responsible for the first formal plan for the park influenced by the City Beautiful Movement.The City Beautiful Movement advocated well planned public spaces, tree-lined boulevards, monuments, public art, and fountains which would 'beautify' the city..A milestone in Fair Park's history was 1936, when the Texas Centennial Exposition was held there.In preparation for the six-month event, the appearance of the park was dramatically altered by architect George Dahl and consulting architect Paul Cret.The park was transformed from an early 20th-century fairground into an Art Deco showcase.While many of the exposition's buildings were meant to be temporary, several have survived and have been restored to some extent.", "San Jose, California": "San Jose, officially the City of San Jos\u00e9 (Spanish for 'Saint Joseph'[14] /\u02ccs\u00e6n ho\u028a\u02c8ze\u026a, -\u02c8se\u026a/ SAN hoh-ZAY,

Bay Area and the San Jose\u2013San Francisco\u2013Oakland Combined Statistical Area, which has a 2015 population of 7.7 million and 9.7 million people respectively,[16] the third-most populous city in California after Los Angeles and San Diego, and the 12th-most populous in the United States.[17][18] Located in the center of the Santa Clara Valley on the southern shore of San Francisco Bay, San Jose covers an area of 179.97sqmi (466.1km2).San Jose is the county seat of Santa Clara County and the main component of the San Jose\u2013Sunnyvale\u2013Santa Clara Metropolitan Statistical Area, with an estimated population of around two million residents in 2018.[19].San Jose is notable for its innovation, cultural diversity,[20] affluence,[21] and sunny and mild Mediterranean climate.[22] Its connection to the booming high tech industry phenomenon known as Silicon Valley[23] prompted Mayor Tom McEnery to adopt the city motto of \"Capital of Silicon Valley\" in 1988 to promote the city.[24] Major global tech companies including Cisco Systems, eBay, Adobe Inc., PayPal, Broadcom, Samsung, Acer, and Zoom maintain their headquarters in San Jose.San Jose is one of the wealthiest major cities in the world, with the third-highest GDP per capita (after Z\u00fcrich and Oslo)[25] and the fifth-most expensive housing market.[26] It is home to one of the world's largest overseas Vietnamese populations,[27] a Hispanic community that makes up over 40% of the city's residents,[28] and historic ethnic enclaves such as Japantown and Little Portugal..Before the arrival of the Spanish, the area around San Jose was long inhabited by the Tamien nation of the Ohlone peoples of California.San Jose was founded on November 29, 1777, as the Pueblo de San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe, the first city founded in the Californias.[29] It  became a part of Mexico in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence..Following the American Conquest of California during the Mexican\u2013American War, the territory was ceded to the United States in 1848.After California achieved statehood two years later, San Jose was designated as the state's first capital.[30] Following World War II, San Jose experienced an economic boom, with a rapid population growth and aggressive annexation of nearby cities and communities carried out in the 1950s and 1960s.The rapid growth of the high-technology and electronics.industries further accelerated the transition from an agricultural center to an urbanized metropolitan area.Results of the 1990 U.S.", "History of Europe": "The history of Europe is traditionally divided into four time periods: prehistoric Europe (prior to about 800 BC), classical antiquity (800 BC to AD 500), the Middle Ages (AD 500 to AD 1500), and the modern era (since AD 1500)..The first early European modern humans appear in the fossil record about 48,000 years ago, during the Paleolithic Era.Settled agriculture marked the Neolithic Era, which spread slowly across Europe from southeast to the north and west.The later Neolithic period saw the introduction of early metallurgy and the use of copper-based tools and weapons, and the building of megalithic structures, as exemplified by Stonehenge.During the Indo-European migrations, Europe saw migrations from the east and southeast.The period known as classical antiquity began with the emergence of the city-states of ancient Greece.Later, the Roman Empire came to dominate the entire Mediterranean basin.The Migration Period of the Germanic people began in the late 4th century AD and made gradual incursions into various parts of the Roman Empire..The Fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476 traditionally marks the start of the Middle Ages.While the Eastern Roman Empire would continue for another 1000 years, the former lands of the Western Empire would be fragmented into a number of different states.At the same time, the early Slavs began to become established as a distinct group in the central and eastern parts of Europe.The first great empire of the Middle Ages was the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, while the Islamic conquest of Iberia established Al-Andalus.",

via USB, the device can be placed near the video display, which allowed voice chat to be conducted within entire rooms across multiple households.[2] The device features an LED indicating when the microphone is active..Wii Speak was announced at Nintendo's 2008 E3 media briefing.It was released on its own, as well as in a bundle alongside Animal Crossing: City Folk, on November 16, 2008 in North America, and on December 5, 2008 in Europe..The Wii Speak accessory was succeeded by the embedded microphone on the Wii U's GamePad controller.Nevertheless, the Wii Speak hardware is still compatible with the Wii U..According to Shigeru Miyamoto, the microphone was designed to \"clearly capture many different voices being spoken in a room at the same time and convey that over the Internet.\"[3] Addressing concerns over background noise due to the placement of the microphone near a television set, Animal Crossing: City Folk producer Katsuya Eguchi stated that the device was designed to filter out video game sound from the audio speakers.[2] Miyamoto noted at the time that the quality of the noise filtering functionality in the Wii Speak is \"very good\", which may have contributed to the cost of the device.[3] An on/off switch was originally planned, but the microphone was ultimately designed to only turn on when a compatible game wants access to it..In addition to the standalone accessory, the Wii Speak was also made available as a bundle alongside Animal Crossing: City Folk.However, it was not originally Nintendo's intention to release such a bundled product..At E3 2008, when asked why the device would not be bundled with City Folk, Nintendo senior managing director Shigeru Miyamoto replied that cost was the factor behind the decision, adding that some users may prefer playing the game without a microphone, and that others may want to use Wii Speak who are not interested in buying City Folk.[3] Despite these initial statements however, Nintendo later revealed that a bundle of the Wii Speak, along with City Folk, would indeed be released, as well as the standalone versions of each.[4] This bundle was a limited edition, and was released the same day as the standalone products.[5].On October 2, 2008, Nintendo announced that Wii Speak would have its own Wii Channel.The Wii Speak Channel could be unlocked for download with a 16-digit \"Wii Download Ticket\" included with the Wii Speak package upon purchase.", "Smart key": "A smart key is an electronic access and authorization system that is available either as standard equipment, or as an option in several car designs.It was first developed by Siemens in 1995 and introduced by Mercedes-Benz under the name \"Keyless-Go\" in 1998 on the W220 S-Class, after the design patent was filed by Daimler-Benz on May 17, 1997.[1].The smart key allows the driver to keep the key fob pocketed when unlocking, locking and starting the vehicle.The key is identified via one of several antennas in the car's bodywork and a radio pulse generator in the key housing.Depending on the system, the vehicle is automatically unlocked when a button or sensor on the door handle or trunk release is pressed.Vehicles with a smart-key system have a mechanical backup, usually in the form of a spare key blade supplied with the vehicle.Some manufacturers hide the backup lock behind a cover for styling..Vehicles with a smart-key system can disengage the immobilizer and activate the ignition without inserting a key in the ignition, provided the driver has the key inside the car.On most vehicles, this is done by pressing a starter button or twisting an ignition switch..When leaving a vehicle that is equipped with a smart-key system, the vehicle is locked by either pressing a button on a door handle, touching a capacitive area on a door handle, or simply walking away from the vehicle.The method of locking varies across models..Some vehicles automatically adjust settings based on the smart key used to unlock the car.", "Univision": "Univision (Spanish pronunciation: [uni\u03b2i\u02c8sjon] \u24d8) is an American Spanish-language free-to-air television network owned by TelevisaUnivision.It is the United States' largest provider of Spanish-language content.[2] The network's programming is aimed at the Latino public and includes telenovelas and other drama series, sports, sitcoms, reality and variety series, news programming, and imported Spanish-language feature films.Univision is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City,[3] and has its major studios, production facilities, and business operations based in Doral, Florida (near Miami)..Univision is available on pay television providers throughout most of the United States, with local stations in over 60 markets with large Latin American communities.Most of these stations air full local newscasts and other local programming in addition to network shows; in major markets such as Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City, the local newscasts carried by the network's owned-and-operated stations are equally competitive with their English-language counterparts ratings-wise.Chief operating officer Randy Falco (who was appointed to the position on January 18, 2011, and officially took over as CEO on June 29 of that year) has been in charge of the company since the departure of Univision Communications president and CEO Joe Uva in April 2011.[4][5] In March 2018, it was announced that Falco would be retiring and stepping down as CEO.[6].Univision's roots can be traced back to 1955, when Raoul A.Cortez started KCOR-TV, an independent station in San Antonio, Texas, which was the nation's first Spanish-only TV outlet.[7] The station was not profitable during its early years, and in 1961, Cortez sold KCOR-TV \u2013 now known as KWEX-TV \u2013 to a group headed by Mexican entertainment mogul Emilio Azc\u00e1rraga Vidaurreta, owner of Mexico-based Telesistema Mexicano (the forerunner of Televisa).Cortez's son-in-law Emilio Nicol\u00e1s Sr., who helped produce variety programs for the station, held a 20% stake and remained as KWEX general manager for three decades.The new owners helped to turn around the station's fortunes by heavily investing in programming, most of it sourced from Telesistema Mexicano.[8].On September 29, 1962, Azc\u00e1rraga and his partners launched a second Spanish-language station, KMEX-TV, in Los Angeles.KWEX and KMEX formed the nucleus of the Azc\u00e1rraga-owned Spanish International Network (SIN), created in late 1962.", "Formation and evolution of the Solar System": "The formation of the Solar System began about 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud.[1] Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed..This model, known as the nebular hypothesis, was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace.Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, chemistry, geology, physics, and planetary science.Since the dawn of the Space Age in the 1950s and the discovery of exoplanets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations..The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation.Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later to have been captured by their planets.Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions.Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System.Beyond Neptune, many sub-planet sized objects formed.Several thousand trans-Neptunian objects have been observed.Unlike the planets, these trans-Neptunian objects mostly move on eccentric orbits, inclined to the plane of the planets.The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions.[2] Planetary migration may have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.[according to whom?].", "The Trial": "The Trial (German: Der Process,[1] previously Der Proce\u00df, Der Proze\u00df and Der Prozess) is a novel written by Franz Kafka in 1914 and 1915 and published posthumously on 26 April 1925.One of his best-known works, it tells the story of Josef K., a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader.Heavily influenced by Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, Kafka even went so far as to call Dostoevsky a blood relative.[2] Like Kafka's two other novels, The Castle and Amerika, The Trial was never completed, although it does include a chapter which appears to bring the story to an intentionally abrupt ending..After Kafka's death in 1924 his friend and literary executor Max Brod edited the text for publication by Verlag Die Schmiede.The original manuscript is held at the Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach am Neckar, Germany.The first English-language translation, by Willa and Edwin Muir, was published in 1937.[3] In 1999, the book was listed in Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century and as No.2 of the Best German Novels of the Twentieth Century..Kafka drafted the opening sentence of The Trial in August 1914, and continued work on the novel throughout 1915.This was an unusually productive period for Kafka, despite the outbreak of World War I, which significantly increased the pressures of his day job as an insurance agent.[4].Having begun by writing the opening and concluding sections of the novel, Kafka worked on the intervening scenes in a haphazard manner, using several different notebooks simultaneously.His friend Max Brod, knowing Kafka's habit of destroying his own work, eventually took the manuscript into safekeeping.This manuscript consisted of 161 loose pages torn from notebooks, which Kafka had bundled together into chapters.The order of the chapters was not made clear to Brod, nor was he told which parts were complete and which unfinished.", "Lisa Loeb": "Lisa Anne Loeb (/lo\u028ab/; born March 11, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, author and actress.She started her career with the number one hit song \"Stay (I Missed You)\" from the film Reality Bites, the first number one single for an artist without a recording contract.[3] She achieved two additional top 20 singles with \"Do You Sleep?\" in 1996 and \"I Do\" in 1998.Her studio albums include two back-to-back albums that were certified gold: Tails and Firecracker.[4].Loeb's film, television and voice-over work includes guest starring roles in the season finale of Gossip Girl, and two episodes, including the series finale, of Netflix's Fuller House.She also starred in two other television series, Dweezil & Lisa, a weekly culinary adventure for the Food Network[5] that featured her alongside Dweezil Zappa, and Number 1 Single on E! Entertainment Television.[6] She has also acted in such films as House on Haunted Hill, Fright Night,[7] Hot Tub Time Machine 2,[8] and Helicopter Mom.[9].Loeb has released children's CDs and books; her 2016 children's CD Feel What U Feel won Best Children's Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.Loeb's latest album, A Simple Trick to Happiness, was released in February 2020..In addition, she has a line of eyewear, and started a non-profit organization that sends under-served children to camp, funded by Loeb's own organic and fair trade coffee, Wake Up! Brew..Lisa Loeb was born to a Jewish[10] family in Bethesda, Maryland,[11] and was raised in Dallas, Texas,[12] where her parents still reside.Her mother, Gail, was the president of the Dallas County Medical Society Alliance and Foundation, and her father, Peter Loeb, was a gastroenterologist.[13] She has a younger sister, songwriter Debbie Loeb.As a child, Lisa studied piano, but later switched to guitar.[3] She attended The Hockaday School, an all-girls private school.For two years, she had her own radio show on 88.5 KRSM-FM, a 10-watt station licensed to the nearby all-boys St.", "Coat of arms of New Jersey": "The coat of arms of the state of New Jersey includes:.It was originally designed by Pierre Eugene du Simitiere in 1777 and was modified slightly in 1928.[1].The seal is the central motif in the flag of New Jersey and the great seal of the state of New Jersey..The coat of arms contains a horse's head; beneath that is a helmet, showing that New Jersey governs itself, and it has three plows on a shield to highlight the state's agriculture tradition, which shows why the state has the nickname \u201cGarden State.\u201d The two Goddesses represent the state motto, \u201cLiberty and Prosperity.\u201d Liberty is on the left.She is holding a staff with a liberty cap on it, and the word \u201cLIBERTY\u201d is underneath her.The goddess on the right is Ceres, goddess of agriculture.She is holding a cornucopia with the word \u201cPROSPERITY\u201d written below her.[2].According to the minutes of the New Jersey General Assembly for May 11, 1896, the date on which the Assembly officially approved the flag as the state emblem, the buff color is due indirectly to George Washington, who had ordered on September 14, 1779, that the uniform coats of the New Jersey Continental Line be dark (Jersey) blue, with buff facings.Buff-colored facings had until then been reserved only for his own uniform and those of other Continental generals and their aides.Then, on February 14, 1780, the Continental War Officers in Philadelphia directed that the uniform coat facings of all regiments were to be the same as the background color of the regiments' state flag.[3].The seal is described in New Jersey statute Title 52, \u00a72-1:[4].The great seal of this state shall be engraved on silver, which shall be round, of two and a half inches in diameter and three-eighths of an inch thick;   the arms shall be three ploughs in an escutcheon, azure; supporters, Liberty  and Ceres.", "We Can Work It Out": "\"We Can Work It Out\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon.It was first issued as a double A-side single with \"Day Tripper\" in December 1965.The song was recorded during the sessions for the band's Rubber Soul album.The single reached number one in Britain (where it won the Ivor Novello Award for the top-selling A-side of 1965),[2] the United States, Australia, Canada and Ireland.In the UK, it was the seventh highest selling single of the 1960s.[3].\"We Can Work It Out\" is a comparatively rare example of a Lennon\u2013McCartney collaboration from this period in the Beatles' career,[4] in that it recalls the level of collaboration the two songwriters had shared when writing the group's hit singles of 1963.This song, \"A Day in the Life\", \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" and \"I've Got a Feeling\", are among the notable exceptions.[5].McCartney wrote the words and music to the verses and the chorus, with lyrics that \"might have been personal\", probably a reference to his relationship with Jane Asher.[6] McCartney then took the song to Lennon, who contributed the middle 8:.I took it to John to finish it off, and we wrote the middle together.Which is nice: 'Life is very short.There's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend.' Then it was George Harrison's idea to put the middle into 34 time, like a German waltz.That came on the session, it was one of the cases of the arrangement being done on the session.[6].", "Pedophilia": "Pedophilia (alternatively spelled paedophilia) is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.[1][2]:\u200avii\u200a Although girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12,[3] psychiatric diagnostic criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13.[4].People with the disorder are often referred to as pedophiles (or paedophiles)..Pedophilia is a paraphilia.In recent versions of formal diagnostic coding systems such as the DSM-5 and ICD-11, \"pedophilia\" is distinguished from \"pedophilic disorder.\" Pedophilic disorder is defined a pattern of pedophilic arousal accompanied by either subjective distress or interpersonal difficulty, or having acted on that arousal.The DSM-5 requires that a person must be at least 16 years old, and at least five years older than the prepubescent child or children they are aroused by, for the attraction to be diagnosed as pedophilic disorder.Similarly, the ICD-11 excludes sexual behavior among post-pubertal children who are close in age.The DSM requires the arousal pattern must be present for 6 months or longer, while the ICD lacks this requirement.The ICD criteria also refrain from specifying chronological ages.[5].In popular usage, the word pedophilia is often applied to any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse, including any sexual interest in minors below the local age of consent, regardless of their level of physical or mental development.[1][2]:\u200avii\u200a[6] This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors.[7][8]  Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided, because although some people who commit child sexual abuse are pedophiles,[6][9] child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children,[7][10][11] and many pedophiles do not molest children.[12].Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century.A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s.Although mostly documented in men, there are also women who exhibit the disorder,[2]:\u200a72\u201374\u200a[13] and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles.[14] No cure for pedophilia has been developed, but there are therapies that can reduce the incidence of a person committing child sexual abuse.[6] The exact causes of pedophilia have not been conclusively established.[2]:\u200a101\u200a Some studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders have correlated it with various neurological abnormalities and psychological pathologies.[15].", "Julio C\u00c3\u00a9sar Ch\u00c3\u00a1vez": "", "The Holocaust": "The Holocaust was the genocide of European Jews during World WarII.Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews across German-occupied Europe, around two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population.The murders were carried out primarily through mass shootings and poison gas in extermination camps, chiefly Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, and Che\u0142mno in occupied Poland..The Nazis developed their ideology based on racism and pursuit of \"living space\", and seized power in early 1933.In an attempt to force all German Jews to emigrate, the regime passed anti-Jewish laws and orchestrated a nationwide pogrom in November 1938.After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, occupation authorities began to establish ghettos to segregate Jews.Following the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, 1.5 to 2million Jews were shot by German forces and local collaborators..Later in 1941 or early 1942, the highest levels of the German government decided to murder all Jews in Europe.Victims were deported by rail to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, most were killed with poison gas.Other Jews continued to be employed in forced labor camps where many died from starvation, abuse or exhaustion[2] or used as test subjects in deadly medical experiments.[3] Although many Jews tried to escape, surviving in hiding was difficult due to factors such as the lack of money to pay helpers and the risk of denunciation.The property, homes, and jobs belonging to murdered Jews were redistributed to the German occupiers and other non-Jews.Although the majority of Holocaust victims died in 1942, the killing continued at a lower rate until the end of the war in May 1945.", "4-H": "4-H is a U.S.-based network of youth organizations whose mission is \"engaging youth to reach their fullest potential while advancing the field of youth development\".[1] Its name is a reference to the occurrence of the initial letter H four times in the organization's original motto head, heart, hands, and health, which was later incorporated into the fuller pledge officially adopted in 1927.In the United States, the organization is administered by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).4-H Canada is an independent non-profit organization overseeing the operation of branches throughout Canada.[2] There are 4-H organizations in over 50 countries;[3] the organization and administration varies from country to country..The goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship, leadership, responsibility and life skills of youth through experiential learning programs and a positive youth development approach.Though typically thought of as an agriculturally focused organization as a result of its history, 4-H today focuses on citizenship, healthy living, science, engineering, and technology programs.Clubs in today's 4-H world consist of a wide range of options each allowing for personal growth and career success.The 4-H motto is \"To make the best better\", while its slogan is \"Learn by doing\" (sometimes written as \"Learn to do by doing\").As of 2016, the organization had nearly 6million active participants and more than 25million alumni.[4].The foundations of 4-H began in 1902 with the work of several people in different parts of the United States.The focal point of 4-H has been the idea of practical and hands-on learning, which came from the desire to make public school education more connected to rural life.Early programs incorporated  both public and private resources.4-H was founded with the purpose of instructing rural youth in improved farming and farm-homemaking practices.", "Flag of Chile": "The flag of Chile consists of two equal-height horizontal bands of white and red, with a blue square the same height as the white band in the canton, which bears a white five-pointed star in the center.It was adopted on 18 October 1817.The Chilean flag is also known in Spanish as La Estrella Solitaria[1] (The Lone Star)..It has a 3:2 ratio between length and width, it is divided horizontally into two bands of equal height (the lower being red).The upper area is divided once: into a square (blue), with a single centered white star; and into a rectangle (white), whose lengths are in proportion 1:2.It is in the stars and stripes flag family..The star represents Venus, significant to the country's indigenous Mapuches,[2] symbolizing a guide to progress and honor while other interpretations say it refers to an independent state; blue symbolizes the sky and the Pacific Ocean, white is for the snow-covered Andes, and red stands for the blood spilled to achieve independence.[3].According to the epic poem La Araucana, the colors were derived from those from the flag flown by the Mapuche during the Arauco War.\"Flag Day\" is held each year on the ninth of July to commemorate the 77 soldiers who died in the 1882 Battle of La Concepci\u00f3n..The first records on the possible use of flags by indigenous peoples date back to the War of Arauco, the most famous being the use described in the late 16th-century epic poem La Araucana.In Canto XXI, Alonso de Ercilla described Talcahuano, warrior and chief of the Mapuche who work the lands near the present-day city that bears his name, bearing emblems of blue, white and red..Two flags have been documented as used by Mapuche troops.", "Generation Y": "Millennials, also known as Generation Y (often shortened to Gen Y), are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z.Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with the generation typically being defined as people born from 1981 to 1996.[1]  Most millennials are the children of baby boomers and older Generation X.[2] In turn millennials are often the parents of Generation Alpha.[3].As the first generation to grow up with the Internet, Millennials have also been described as the first global generation.[4] The generation is generally marked by elevated usage of and familiarity with the Internet, mobile devices, and social media.[5] The term \"digital natives\", which is now also applied to successive generations, was originally coined to describe this generation.[6].Millennials have also been called the \"Unluckiest Generation\" because the average millennial has experienced slower economic growth since entering the workforce than any other generation in U.S.history.[7] The generation has also been weighed down by student debt and child-care costs.[8].Across the globe, young people have postponed marriage or living together as a couple.[9] Millennials were born at a time of declining fertility rates around the world,[10] and are having fewer children than their predecessors.[11][12][13][14] Those in developing nations will continue to constitute the bulk of global population growth.[15] In the developed world, young people of the 2010s were less inclined to have sexual intercourse compared to their predecessors when they were at the same age.[16] In the West, they are less likely to be religious than their predecessors, but they may identify as spiritual.[17][10].Between the 1990s and the 2010s, people from the developing world became increasingly well educated, a factor that boosted economic growth in these countries.[18] Millennials across the world have suffered significant economic disruption since starting their working lives; many faced high levels of youth unemployment during their early years in the job market in the wake of the Great Recession, and suffered another recession in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[19][20].Members of this demographic cohort are known as millennials because the oldest became adults around the turn of the millennium.[21] Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, known for creating the Strauss\u2013Howe generational theory, are widely credited with naming the millennials.[22] They coined the term in 1987, around the time children born in 1982 were entering kindergarten, and the media were first identifying their prospective link to the impending new millennium as the high school graduating class of 2000.[23] They wrote about the cohort in their books Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 (1991)[24] and Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation (2000).[23].In August 1993, an Advertising Age editorial coined the phrase Generation Y to describe teenagers of the day, then aged 13\u201319 (born 1974\u20131980), who were at the time defined as different from Generation X.[25] However, the 1974\u20131980 cohort was later re-identified by most media sources as the last wave of Generation X,[26] and by 2003 Ad Age had moved their Generation Y starting year up to 1982.[27] According to journalist Bruce Horovitz, in 2012, Ad Age \"threw in the towel by conceding that millennials is a better name than Gen Y,\"[22] and by 2014, a past director of data strategy at Ad Age said to NPR \"the Generation Y label was a placeholder until we found out more about them.\"[28].Millennials are sometimes called echo boomers, due to them often being the offspring of the baby boomers, the significant increase in birth rates from the early 1980s to mid-1990s, and their generation's large size relative to that of boomers.[29][30][31][32] In the United States, the echo boom's birth rates peaked in August 1990[33][29] and a twentieth-century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued.[34][35] Psychologist Jean Twenge described millennials as \"Generation Me\" in her 2006 book Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled \u2013 and More Miserable Than Ever Before,[36][37] while in 2013, Time magazine ran a cover story titled Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation.[38] Alternative names for this group proposed include the Net Generation,[39] Generation 9/11,[40] Generation Next,[41] and The Burnout Generation.[42].Oxford Living Dictionaries describes a millennial as a person \"born between the early 1980s and the late 1990s.\"[43] Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines millennial as \"a person born in the 1980s or 1990s\".[44] More detailed definitions in use are as follows:.Jonathan Rauch, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote for The Economist in 2018 that \"generations are squishy concepts\", but the 1981 to 1996 birth cohort is a \"widely accepted\" definition for millennials.[1] Reuters also state that the \"widely accepted definition\" is 1981\u20131996.[45].", "Great Fire of Rome": "The Great Fire of Rome (Latin: incendium magnum Romae) began on the 18th of July 64 AD.[1] The fire began in the merchant shops around Rome's chariot stadium, Circus Maximus.After six days, the fire was brought under control, but before the damage could be assessed, the fire reignited and burned for another three days.In the aftermath of the fire, 71% of Rome had been destroyed (10 out of 14 districts).[2].According to Tacitus and later Christian tradition, Emperor Nero blamed the devastation on the Christian community in the city, initiating the empire's first persecution against the Christians.[3] Other contemporary historians blamed Nero's incompetence but it is commonly agreed by historians now that Rome was so tightly packed an eventual fire was inevitable..Fires in Rome were common, especially in houses,[4] and fires that had occurred previously in Rome and destroyed parts of major buildings include:.Nero was proclaimed Roman emperor in AD 54 at the age of 17.[2] His rule has commonly been associated with impulsiveness and tyranny but was, for the most part, liked by the general populace and only really disliked by the aristocracy.Early in his reign, he was heavily advised, but he slowly became more independent.In AD 59, encouraged by his mistress Poppaea, Nero murdered his mother Agrippina.His leading adviser, Seneca, was discharged and forced to commit suicide.After the Great Fire of Rome occurred in July AD 64, it was rumored that Nero had ordered the fire to clear space for a new palace, the Domus Aurea.[6][pageneeded] At the time of the fire Nero may not have been in the city but 35 miles away at his villa in Antium,[7] and possibly returned to the city before the fire was out.[8].Publius Cornelius Tacitus was a senator and historian of the Roman Empire.His exact birth date is unknown, but most sources place it in either AD 56 or 57.", "Virginia": "Virginia, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia,[a] is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains.The state's capital is Richmond, its most populous city is Virginia Beach, and Fairfax County is the state's most populous political subdivision.Virginia's population in 2022[update] was over 8.68million, with 35% living within the Greater Washington metropolitan area.The Blue Ridge Mountains cross the western and southwestern parts of the state, while the state's central region lies mostly within the Piedmont.Eastern Virginia is part of the Atlantic Plain, with the Middle Peninsula forming the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay..Virginia's history begins with several Indigenous groups, including the Powhatan.In 1607, the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World.Virginia's state nickname, the Old Dominion, is a reference to this status.Slave labor and land from displaced native tribes fueled the growing plantation economy, but also fueled conflicts both inside and outside the colony.Virginia was one of the original Thirteen Colonies in the American Revolution, during which several key battles were fought there.More major battles were fought in Virginia during the American Civil War, which split the state as the government in Richmond joined the Confederacy, but many northwestern counties remained loyal to the Union and separated as the state of West Virginia in 1863.Although the state was under one-party rule for nearly a century following the Reconstruction era, both major political parties are competitive in modern Virginia..", "Windows Movie Maker": "Windows Movie Maker (known as Windows Live Movie Maker[6] for the 2009 and 2011 releases) is a discontinued video editing software program by Microsoft.It was first included in Windows Me on September 14, 2000, and in Windows XP on October 25, 2001.It later became a part of the Windows Essentials software suite, and offered the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, Windows Live Groups, and Flickr.It is comparable to Apple's iMovie..Movie Maker was officially discontinued by Microsoft on January 10, 2017, and it is replaced by Video Editor (formerly Microsoft Story Remix) which is built in with Microsoft Photos on Windows 10, and Clipchamp on Windows 11, which Microsoft acquired in September 2021..The first release of Windows Movie Maker was included with Windows Me on September 14, 2000..Version 1.1 was included in Windows XP a year later, and included support for creating DV AVI and WMV 8 files.Version 2.0 was released as a free update in November 2002, and added a number of new features.Version 2.1, a minor update, is included in Windows XP Service Pack 2.The Movie Maker in Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 had more transitions and support for DVD burning..The next version of Movie Maker was released as part of Windows Vista and \u2013 like most Windows components \u2013 reported version number 6.0.6000, same as Windows Vista itself.It included new effects and transitions, support for playback on the Xbox 360,[7] and support for the DVR-MS file format that Windows Media Center records television in.", "Brenda's Got a Baby": "\"Brenda's Got a Baby\" is a song by American rapper 2Pac from his debut album, 2Pacalypse Now (1991).The song was first released as a promotional CD single a month prior to album's release and then, in February 1992, it was re-released as a double A-side single with the song \"If My Homie Calls\".The song, which features R&B singer Dave Hollister singing background vocals with Roniece Levias, is about a 12-year-old girl named Brenda who lives in a ghetto and has a baby she can't support.The song explores the issue of teen pregnancy and its effect on young mothers and their families.Like many of Shakur's songs, \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" draws from the plight of the impoverished.Using Brenda to represent young mothers in general, Shakur criticises the low level of support from the baby's father, the government, and society in general.Shakur wrote the song while filming the feature film Juice, after reading a newspaper article about a 12-year-old girl who became pregnant by her cousin and threw the baby into a trash compactor.[1].The video of the song is in black-and-white.It was made to visualize what the rapper Shakur narrates.The first part shows Shakur and \"Brenda\" and then the actual story starts.Ethel \"Edy\" Proctor portrays Brenda..The video begins with \"based on a true story,\" although the characters themselves are fictitious (actors), Shakur wrote the song after reading a story in the newspaper of a 12-year-old girl getting pregnant by her cousin and trying to dispose of the baby in a trash can..", "Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon": "Pok\u00e9mon[a] is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media.The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pok\u00e9mon, a large variety of species endowed with special powers.The franchise's target audience is children aged 5 to 12,[1] but it is known to attract people of all ages.[2][3][4][5].The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, following an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri.Released on the Game Boy on February 27, 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime series and films.From 1998 to 2000, Pok\u00e9mon was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed \"Pok\u00e9mania\".By 2002, the craze had ended, after which Pok\u00e9mon became a fixture in popular culture, with new products being released to this day.In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of Pok\u00e9mon Go, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic.Pok\u00e9mon has since been estimated to be the world's highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises..Pok\u00e9mon has an uncommon ownership structure.Unlike most IPs, which are owned by one company, Pok\u00e9mon is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.[6][7] Game Freak develops the core series role-playing games, which are published by Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles.The three companies established The Pok\u00e9mon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the Pok\u00e9mon property within Asia.", "Dada": "Dada (/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0d\u0251\u02d0/) or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century, with early centres in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, at the Cabaret Voltaire (in 1916), founded by Hugo Ball with his companion Emmy Hennings, and in Berlin in 1917.[2][3] New York Dada began c.\u20091915,[4][5] and after 1920 Dada flourished in Paris.Dadaist activities lasted until the mid 1920s..Developed in reaction to World War I, the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected the logic, reason, and aestheticism of modern capitalist society, instead expressing nonsense, irrationality, and anti-bourgeois protest in their works.[6][7][8] The art of the movement began primarily as performance[9] art, but eventually spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including collage, sound poetry, cut-up writing, and sculpture.Dadaist artists expressed their discontent toward violence, war, and nationalism and maintained political affinities with radical politics on the left-wing and far-left politics.[10][11][12][13].There is no consensus on the origin of the movement's name; a common story is that the German artist Richard Huelsenbeck slid a paper knife (letter-opener) at random into a dictionary, where it landed on \"dada\", a colloquial French term for a hobby horse.Jean Arp wrote that Tristan Tzara invented the word at 6p.m.on 6February 1916, in the Caf\u00e9 de la Terrasse in Z\u00fcrich.[14] Others note that it suggests the first words of a child, evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group.Still others speculate that the word might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning (or no meaning at all) in any language, reflecting the movement's internationalism.[15].The roots of Dada lie in pre-war avant-garde.The term anti-art, a precursor to Dada, was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 to characterize works that challenge accepted definitions of art.[16] Cubism and the development of collage and abstract art would inform the movement's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention.The work of French poets, Italian Futurists and the German Expressionists would influence Dada's rejection of the tight correlation between words and meaning.[17] Works such as Ubu Roi (1896) by Alfred Jarry and the ballet Parade (1916\u201317) by Erik Satie would also be characterized as proto-Dadaist works.[18] The Dada movement's principles were first collected in Hugo Ball's Dada Manifesto in 1916.Ball is seen as the founder of the Dada movement.[19].", "Trophic level": "The trophic level of an organism is the position it occupies in a food web.A food chain is a succession of organisms that eat other organisms and may, in turn, be eaten themselves.The trophic level of an organism is the number of steps it is from the start of the chain.A food web starts at trophic level1 with primary producers such as plants, can move to herbivores at level2, carnivores at level3 or higher, and typically finish with apex predators at level4 or 5.The path along the chain can form either a one-way flow or a food \"web\".Ecological communities with higher biodiversity form more complex trophic paths..The word trophic derives from the Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ae (troph\u0113) referring to food or nourishment.[1].The concept of trophic level was developed by Raymond Lindeman (1942), based on the terminology of August Thienemann (1926): \"producers\", \"consumers\", and \"reducers\" (modified to \"decomposers\" by Lindeman).[2][3].The three basic ways in which organisms get food are as producers, consumers, and decomposers..Trophic levels can be represented by numbers, starting at level 1 with plants.Further trophic levels are numbered subsequently according to how far the organism is along the food chain..In real-world ecosystems, there is more than one food chain for most organisms, since most organisms eat more than one kind of food or are eaten by more than one type of predator.", "Silk": "Silk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles.The protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons.[1] The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture).The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors..Silk is produced by several insects; but, generally, only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing.There has been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level.[2] Silk is mainly produced by the larvae of insects undergoing complete metamorphosis, but some insects, such as webspinners and raspy crickets, produce silk throughout their lives.[3] Silk production also occurs in hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants), silverfish, caddisflies, mayflies, thrips, leafhoppers, beetles, lacewings, fleas, flies, and midges.[2] Other types of arthropods produce silk, most notably various arachnids, such as spiders..The word silk comes from Old English: sioloc, from Latin: sericum[4] and Ancient Greek: \u03c3\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, romanized:s\u0113rik\u00f3s, \"silken\", ultimately from the Chinese word \"s\u012b\" and other Asian sources\u2014compare Mandarin s\u012b \"silk\", Manchurian sirghe, Mongolian sirkek.[5].The production of silk originated in China in the Neolithic period, although it would eventually reach other places of the world (Yangshao culture, 4th millennium BC).Silk production remained confined to China until the Silk Road opened at some point during the latter part of the 1st millennium BC, though China maintained its virtual monopoly over silk production for another thousand years..Several kinds of wild silk, produced by caterpillars other than the mulberry silkworm, have been known and spun in China, South Asia, and Europe since ancient times, e.g.the production of Eri silk in Assam, India.However, the scale of production was always far smaller than for cultivated silks.There are several reasons for this: first, they differ from the domesticated varieties in colour and texture and are therefore less uniform; second, cocoons gathered in the wild have usually had the pupa emerge from them before being discovered so the silk thread that makes up the cocoon has been torn into shorter lengths; and third, many wild cocoons are covered in a mineral layer that prevents attempts to reel from them long strands of silk.[6] Thus, the only way to obtain silk suitable for spinning into textiles in areas where commercial silks are not cultivated was by tedious and labor-intensive carding..", "Late Show with David Letterman": "The Late Show with David Letterman is an American late-night talk show hosted by David Letterman on CBS, the first iteration of the Late Show franchise.The show debuted on August 30, 1993,[2] and was produced by Letterman's production company, Worldwide Pants, and CBS Television Studios.The show's music director and leader

defamation, slander and libel.It may also include monitoring, identity theft, threats, vandalism, solicitation for sex, doxing, or blackmail.[1].Cyberstalking is often accompanied by realtime or offline stalking.[3] In many jurisdictions, such as California, both are criminal offenses.[4] Both are motivated by a desire to control, intimidate or influence a victim.[5] A stalker may be an online stranger or a person whom the target knows.They may be anonymous and solicit involvement of other people online who do not even know the target.[6].Cyberstalking is a criminal offense under various state anti-stalking, slander and harassment laws.A conviction can result in a restraining order, probation, or criminal penalties against the assailant, including jail..There have been a number of attempts by experts and legislators to define cyberstalking.It is generally understood to be the use of the Internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual, a group, or an organization.[1] Cyberstalking is a form of cyberbullying; the terms are often used interchangeably in the media.Both may include false accusations, defamation, slander and libel.[3].Cyberstalking may also include monitoring, identity theft, threats, vandalism, solicitation for sex, or gathering information that may be used to threaten or harass.Cyberstalking is often accompanied by real-time or offline stalking.[3] Both forms of stalking may be criminal offenses.[4].Stalking is a continuous process, consisting of a series of actions, each of which may be entirely legal in itself.", "Business letter": "A business letter is a letter from one company to another, or  such organizations and their customers, clients, or other external parties.The overall style of letter depends on the relationship between the parties concerned.Business letters can have many types of content, for example to request direct information or action from another party, to order supplies from a supplier, to point out a mistake by the letter's recipient, to reply directly to a request, to apologize for a wrong, or to convey goodwill.A business letter is sometimes useful because it produces a permanent written record, and may be taken more seriously by the recipient than other forms of communication.It is written in formal language.[1][2].Typically, side, top and bottom margins are 25\u201332 millimetres (1\u20131+1\u20444in) inches, and one-page letters and memos are vertically centered..No special character or font formatting is used, except for the subject line, which is usually underlined..The salutation or greeting is generally followed by a comma in British style, whereas in the United States a colon is used in formal contexts and a comma otherwise.The valediction or closing is followed by a comma..The following is the general format, excluding indentation used in various formats:.Business letters conform to generally one of six indentation formats: standard, open, block, semi-block, modified block, and modified semi-block.Put simply, \"semi-\" means that the first lines of paragraphs are indented; \"modified\" means that the sender's address, date, and closing are significantly indented..", "Tilapia": "Tilapia (/t\u026a\u02c8l\u0251\u02d0pi\u0259/ tih-LAH-pee-\u0259) is the common name for nearly a hundred species of cichlid fish from the coelotilapine, coptodonine, heterotilapine, oreochromine, pelmatolapiine, and tilapiine tribes (formerly all were \"Tilapiini\"), with the economically most important species placed in the Coptodonini and Oreochromini.[2] Tilapia are mainly freshwater fish inhabiting shallow streams, ponds, rivers, and lakes, and less commonly found living in brackish water.Historically, they have been of major importance in artisanal fishing in Africa, and they are of increasing importance in aquaculture and aquaponics.Tilapia can become a problematic invasive species in new warm-water habitats such as Australia,[3] whether deliberately or accidentally introduced, but generally not in temperate climates due to their inability to survive in cold water..Tilapia has been the fourth-most consumed fish in the United States since 2002.The popularity of tilapia came about due to its low price, easy preparation, and mild taste.[4].It is also a traditionally popular food in the Philippines, also known for its low cost and mild taste.Traditionally, the fish is either fried as an individual food or boiled as part of a dish in the country..The aquaculture of Nile tilapia goes back to Ancient Egypt, where it was represented by the hieroglyph K1, of the Gardiner list: \ud80c\udd9b..It was a symbol of rebirth in Egyptian art, and was in addition associated with Hathor.It was also said to accompany and protect the sun god on his daily journey across the sky.Tilapia painted on tomb walls, is reminiscent of spell 15 of the Book of the Dead by which the deceased hopes to take his place in the sun boat: \"You see the tilapia in its [true] form at the turquoise pool\", and \"I behold the tilapia in its [true] nature guiding the speedy boat in its waters.\"[5].Tilapia were one of the three main types of fish caught in Talmudic times from the Sea of Galilee, specifically the Galilean comb (Sarotherodon galilaeus).", "Turner & Hooch": "Tina Turner (born Anna Mae Bullock; November 26, 1939

also has a military base alongside its civilian terminal..There are two other airports managed by the Israel Airports Authority, but have no scheduled flights..There are about 14 other airstrips across Israel and the Golan Heights, which are mostly used privately or for flight trainings..All military airbases are owned by the Israeli Air Force..Israel's only spaceport, also has a military airbase alongside the spaceport.Traffic is restricted by the Israeli Air Force.It is also managed partially by the Israel Space Agency..El Al at Ben Gurion Airport.Aerial view of Ben Gurion Airport.", "Adolf Hitler": "Adolf Hitler (German: [\u02c8a\u02d0d\u0254lf \u02c8h\u026atl\u0250] \u24d8; 20 April 1889 \u2013 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who was the dictator of Germany from 1933 until his suicide in 1945.He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party,[a] becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title of F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler in 1934.[b] During his dictatorship, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1September 1939.He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims..Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz.He lived in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1900s before moving to Germany in 1913.He was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I.In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and in 1921 was appointed leader of the Nazi Party.In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of five years.In prison, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\").After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda.He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy..By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the Reichstag but did not have a majority.", "Domain name": "In the Internet, a domain name is a string that identifies a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control.Domain names are often used to identify services provided through the Internet, such as websites, email services and more.As of 2017,[update] 330.6 million domain names had been registered.[1] Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes.In general, a domain name identifies a network domain or an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, or a server computer..Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS).Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name.Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root domain, which is nameless.The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs).Below these top-level domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly accessible Internet resources or run web sites..The registration of a second- or third-level domain name is usually administered by a domain name registrar who sell its services to the public..A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that is completely specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts omitted.Traditionally a FQDN ends in a dot (.) to denote the top of the DNS tree.[2] Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may therefore be written in any desired capitalization method, but most commonly domain names are written in lowercase in technical contexts.[3].", "Nitrate": "Nitrate is a polyatomic ion with the chemical formula NO\u22123.Salts containing this ion are called nitrates.Nitrates are common components of fertilizers and explosives.[1] Almost all inorganic nitrates are soluble in water.An example of an insoluble nitrate is bismuth oxynitrate..The ion is the conjugate base of nitric acid, consisting of one central nitrogen atom surrounded by three identically bonded oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement.The nitrate ion carries a formal charge of \u22121.This charge results from a combination formal charge in which each of the three oxygens carries a \u22122\u20443 charge, whereas the nitrogen carries a +1 charge, all these adding up to formal charge of the polyatomic nitrate ion.This arrangement is commonly used as an example of resonance.Like the isoelectronic carbonate ion, the nitrate ion can be represented by resonance structures:.A rich source of inorganic nitrate in the human diets come from leafy green foods, such as spinach and arugula.NO\u22123 (inorganic nitrate) is the viable active component within beetroot juice and other vegetables.Drinking water is also a dietary source.[2].", "Agriculture in the United States": "Agriculture is a major industry in the United States, which is a net exporter of food.[1] As of the 2017 census of agriculture, there were 2.04 million farms, covering an area of 900million acres (1,400,000sqmi), an average of 441 acres (178 hectares) per farm.[2].Agriculture in the United States is highly mechanized, with an average of only one farmer or farm laborer required per square kilometer of farmland for agricultural production..Although agricultural activity occurs in every U.S.state, it is particularly concentrated in the Central Valley of California and in the Great Plains, a vast expanse of flat arable land in the center of the nation, in the region west of the Great Lakes and east of the Rocky Mountains.The eastern wetter half is a major corn and soybean-producing region known as the Corn Belt, and the western drier half is known as the Wheat Belt because of its high rate of wheat production.[3] The Central Valley of California produces fruits, vegetables, and nuts.The American South has historically been a large producer of cotton, tobacco, and rice, but it has declined in agricultural production over the past century.Florida leads the nation in citrus production and is the number two producer of oranges in the world behind only Brazil..The U.S.has led developments in seed improvement, such as hybridization, and in expanding uses for crops from the work of George Washington Carver to bioplastics and biofuels.The mechanization of farming and intensive farming have been major themes in U.S.history, including John Deere's steel plow, Cyrus McCormick's mechanical reaper, Eli Whitney's cotton gin, and the widespread success of the Fordson tractor and the combine harvester.Modern agriculture in the U.S.", "Mpemba effect": "The Mpemba effect is the name given to the observation that a liquid (typically water) which is initially hot can freeze faster than the same liquid which begins cold, under otherwise similar conditions.There is disagreement about its theoretical basis and the parameters required to produce the effect.[1][2].The Mpemba effect is named after Tanzanian scientist Erasto Bartholomeo Mpemba, who described it in 1963 as a secondary school student.The initial discovery and observations of the effect originate in ancient times; Aristotle said that it was common knowledge.[3].The phenomenon, when taken to mean \"hot water freezes faster than cold\", is difficult to reproduce or confirm because it is ill-defined.[4] Monwhea Jeng proposed a more precise wording: \"There exists a set of initial parameters, and a pair of temperatures, such that given two bodies of water identical in these parameters, and differing only in initial uniform temperatures, the hot one will freeze sooner.\"[5] Even with Jeng's definition, it is not clear whether \"freezing\" refers to the point at which water forms a visible surface layer of ice, the point at which the entire volume of water becomes a solid block of ice, or when the water reaches 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F; 273K).[4] Jeng's definition suggests simple ways in which the effect might be observed, such as if a warmer temperature melts the frost on a cooling surface, thereby increasing thermal conductivity between the cooling surface and the water container.[4] Alternatively, the Mpemba effect may not be evident in situations and under circumstances that at first seem to qualify.[4].Various effects of heat on the freezing of water were described by ancient scientists, including Aristotle: \"The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes to its freezing quickly: for so it cools sooner.Hence many people, when they want to cool water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun.\"[6] Aristotle's explanation involved antiperistasis: \"...the supposed increase in the intensity of a quality as a result of being surrounded by its contrary quality.\"[citation needed].Francis Bacon noted that \"slightly tepid water freezes more easily than that which is utterly cold.\"[7] Ren\u00e9 Descartes wrote in his Discourse on the Method, relating the phenomenon to his vortex theory: \"One can see by experience that water that has been kept on a fire for a long time freezes faster than other, the reason being that those of its particles that are least able to stop bending evaporate while the water is being heated.\"[8].Scottish scientist Joseph Black investigated a special case of the phenomenon by comparing previously-boiled with unboiled water;[9] he found that the previously-boiled water froze more quickly.Evaporation was controlled for.He discussed the influence of stirring on the results of the experiment, noting that stirring the unboiled water led to it freezing at the same time as the previously-boiled water, and also noted that stirring the very-cold unboiled water led to immediate freezing.Joseph Black then discussed Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit's description of supercooling of water, arguing that the previously-boiled water could not be as readily supercooled.[citation needed].", "Siamese (cat)": "The Siamese cat (Thai: \u0e41\u0e21\u0e27\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22, Maeo Thai; \u0e41\u0e21\u0e27\u0e2a\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21, Maeo Sayam) is one of the first distinctly recognised breeds of Asian cat.Derived from the Wichianmat landrace, one of several varieties of cats native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the original Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century.[1] The carefully refined, more extreme-featured, modern-style Siamese is characterised by blue almond-shaped eyes; a triangular head shape; large ears; an elongated, slender, and muscular body; and various forms of point colouration.Other than colouration, the modern-style Siamese bears little resemblance to the original stock, and the more moderate, traditional, or \"old-style\" Siamese, with a much rounder head and body, has been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat.The International Cat Association describes the modern Siamese as affectionate, social, intelligent, and playful into adulthood, often enjoying a game of fetch.[2] Siamese tend to seek human interaction and also like companionship from other cats..The Siamese (sometimes in the traditional form) is among the foundation stock of several other breeds developed by crossbreeding with other cats; some examples are the Oriental Shorthair and Colorpoint Shorthair, developed to expand the range of coat patterns; the long-haired variant most often dubbed the Himalayan; and hair-mutation breeds, including the Cornish Rex, Sphynx, Peterbald, and blue-point Siamese cat.The Siamese cat comes in two distinct variations: traditional, with a rounded head (though not as rounded as the later American Apple-head mix) and a slightly chubby body; or the modern Siamese, which is very skinny and has a wedge-shaped head.The long-haired Siamese is recognised internationally as a Balinese cat.Siamese cats are one of the more common breeds to have non-white irises..A description and depiction of the Wichienmaat (Siamese cat) first appears in a collection of ancient manuscripts called the Tamra Maew (The Cat-Book Poems), thought to originate from the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1351 to 1767 AD).Over a dozen are now kept in the National Library of Thailand, while others have resurfaced outside of Thailand and are now in the British Library and National Library of Australia.In addition to the old Siamese cat, the Tamra Maew also describes other heritage cats of Thailand including the Korat cat (Malet), which is still bred for preservation in Thailand today and has become popular in other countries, and the Konja cat (Black cat), Suphalak (a controversy in Burmese cat)..When the capital city Ayutthaya was sacked on 7 April 1767 at the end of the Burmese\u2013Siamese war, the Burmese army burned everything in sight.", "QFC": "Quality Food Centers, better known as QFC, is an American supermarket chain based in Bellevue, Washington, east of Seattle.It is a subsidiary of Kroger and has 62 stores in western Washington and northwestern Oregon, primarily located in the Puget Sound region and Portland\u2013Vancouver metropolitan area..Jack Croco began his career in the grocery business in the 1940s in Boise, Idaho, working for Albertsons.By 1950, he had become the district manager in the Northwest and was responsible for opening the first Albertson's stores in the Seattle area.Soon afterward in 1955, Croco opened his own grocery store in Bellevue, called Lake Hills Thriftway.[citation needed].The grocery chain that would come to be named QFC in 1963[1] was founded in 1955 with the first store at 6600 Roosevelt Way N.E.in Seattle[1] by a group headed by Vern Fortin, the former president of Van de Kamp's Holland Dutch Bakeries and founder of Vernell's Fine Candies.Croco merged his store with QFC in 1960, and remained involved in the company until his death in 1991 at the age of 65,[2] though in 1986 he sold QFC to Seattle investment firm Sloan, Adkins & Co.,[3] which took QFC public in 1987.[1].Christopher A.Sinclair became the CEO in 1996; the following year, QFC purchased the Uddenberg grocery company, which operated Thriftway and Stock Market stores throughout western Washington.In late 1997, QFC was sold to Portland-based Fred Meyer,[1][4] and several months later in May 1998, Kroger announced its intention to acquire Fred Meyer (and QFC),[5][6] which was approved a year later.The Roosevelt store operated until 2012; it closed on May 5 to make way for construction of the Roosevelt light rail station.[7].", "Money supply": "In macroeconomics, the money supply (or money stock) refers to the total volume of money held by the public at a particular point in time.There are several ways to define \"money\", but standard measures usually include currency in circulation (i.e.physical cash) and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions).[1][2] Money supply data is recorded and published, usually by the national statistical agency or the central bank of the country.Empirical money supply measures are usually named M1, M2, M3, etc., according to how wide a definition of money they embrace.The precise definitions vary from country to country, in part depending on national financial institutional traditions..Even for narrow aggregates like M1, by far the largest part of the money supply consists of deposits in commercial banks, whereas currency (banknotes and coins) issued by central banks only makes up a small part of the total money supply in modern economies.The public's demand for currency and bank deposits and commercial banks' supply of loans are consequently important determinants of money supply changes.As these decisions are influenced by central banks' monetary policy, not least their setting of interest rates, the money supply is ultimately determined by complex interactions between non-banks, commercial banks and central banks..According to the quantity theory supported by the monetarist school of thought, there is a tight causal connection between growth in the money supply and inflation.In particular during the 1970s and 1980s this idea was influential, and several major central banks during that period attempted to control the money supply closely, following a monetary policy target of increasing the money supply stably.However, the strategy was generally found to be impractical because money demand turned out to be too unstable for the strategy to work as intended..Consequently, the money supply has lost its central role in monetary policy, and central banks today generally do not try to control the money supply.", "Imax": "IMAX is a proprietary system of high-resolution cameras, film formats, film projectors, and theaters known for having very large screens with a tall aspect ratio (approximately either 1.43:1 or 1.90:1) and steep stadium seating, with the 1.43:1 ratio format being available only in few selected locations.[1].Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor, Robert Kerr, and William C.Shaw were the co-founders of what would be named the IMAX Corporation (founded in September 1967 as Multiscreen Corporation, Limited), and they developed the first IMAX cinema projection standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Canada.[2].IMAX GT is the large format as originally conceived.It uses very large screens of 18 by 24 metres (59 by 79 feet) and, unlike most conventional film projectors, the film runs horizontally so that the image width can be greater than the width of the film stock.It is called the 15/70 format.It is used exclusively in purpose-built theaters and dome theaters, and many installations limit themselves to a projection of high quality, short documentaries..The high costs involved in the construction and maintenance of the dedicated buildings and projectors suggested the introduction of several compromises in the following years..To reduce costs, the IMAX SR and MPX systems were introduced in 1998 and 2004, respectively, to make IMAX available to multiplex and existing theaters.The SR system featured slightly smaller screens than GT theatres, though still in purpose-built auditoriums with a 1.43:1 aspect ratio.The MPX projectors were solely used to retrofit existing multiplex auditoriums, losing much of the quality of the GT experience.[3].Later came the introduction of the IMAX Digital 2K and IMAX with Laser 4K in 2008 and 2014 respectively, still limited in respect to the 70 megapixels of equivalent resolution of the original 15/70 film.", "Today's Special": "Today's Special is a Canadian children's television program produced by Clive VanderBurgh at TVOntario, originally broadcasting 120 episodes from 1981 to 1987.Much of the series was set in a department store, based on Simpson's then-flagship location in Toronto.Some store sequences were shot at the Queen Street West and Yonge Street store after hours.The show ran on TVOntario in Canada as well as Nickelodeon in the United States.Reruns of the series continued into 2000 on stations such as PBS affiliates (most of which stopped airing by the mid-1990s) in the United States and on Treehouse TV in Canada..In the children's department of a major department store, each night when Jodie arrives for work, she carries a mannequin (Jeff) upstairs, where Muffy says the magic words \"hocus pocus alimagocus!\" This brings him to life..Many early episodes focused on a tangible object as a subject, such as hats or costumes, with the show revolving around teaching about it.Later episodes dealt with more complicated ones, such as the episode \"Wishes\" dealing with sacrificing one thing for another, \"Butterflies\", which deals with death, or \"Phil's Visit\", which dealt with alcoholism..Short films, often less than a minute long, were often inserted as breaks in the episode's main plot, narrated by Robyn Hayle (the same actress who provided the voice of TXL).These included Mime Lady segments, animated quizzes designed to test a child's observation, narrated storybooks, and popular nursery rhymes (which an unseen Muffy would introduce with \"And now I'd like to introduce a nursery rhyme by Mother Goose\")..Many episodes featured one or more one-time visitors to the store.Some would cause problems for the characters, while others would befriend them and help solve their problems.", "Constitutionalism": "Constitutionalism is \"a compound of ideas, attitudes, and patterns of behavior elaborating the principle that the authority of government derives from and is limited by a body of fundamental law\".[1].Political organizations are constitutional to the extent that they \"contain institutionalized mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and liberties of the citizenry, including those that may be in the minority\".[2] As described by political scientist and constitutional scholar David Fellman:.Constitutionalism is descriptive of a complicated concept, deeply embedded in historical experience, which subjects the officials who exercise governmental powers to the limitations of a higher law.Constitutionalism proclaims the desirability of the rule of law as opposed to rule by the arbitrary judgment or mere fiat of public officials...Throughout the literature dealing with modern public law and the foundations of statecraft the central element of the concept of constitutionalism is that in political society government officials are not free to do anything they please in any manner they choose; they are bound to observe both the limitations on power and the procedures which are set out in the supreme, constitutional law of the community.It may therefore be said that the touchstone of constitutionalism is the concept of limited government under a higher law.[3].Constitutionalism has prescriptive and descriptive uses.Law professor Gerhard Casper captured this aspect of the term in noting, \"Constitutionalism has both descriptive and prescriptive connotations.Used descriptively, it refers chiefly to the historical struggle for constitutional recognition of the people's right to 'consent' and certain other rights, freedoms, and privileges.Used prescriptively, its meaning incorporates those features of government seen as the essential elements of the...Constitution\".[4].One example of constitutionalism's descriptive use is law professor Bernard Schwartz's five volume compilation of sources seeking to trace the origins of the U.S.", "Ice-cream headache": "A cold-stimulus headache, colloquially known as an ice-cream headache or brain freeze, is a form of brief pain or headache commonly associated with consumption (particularly quick consumption) of cold beverages or foods such as ice cream, popsicles, and snow cones.It is caused by a cold substance touching the roof of the mouth, and is believed to result from a nerve response causing rapid constriction and swelling of blood vessels,[3] \"referring\" pain from the roof of the mouth to the head.[4][5] The rate of intake for cold foods has been studied as a contributing factor.[1][6] It can also occur during a sudden exposure of unprotected head to cold temperatures, such as by diving into cold water.[7] A cold-stimulus headache is distinct from dentin hypersensitivity, a type of dental pain that can occur under similar circumstances..Cats and other animals have been observed exhibiting a similar reaction when presented with a similar stimulus.[8].The term ice-cream headache has been in use since at least January 31, 1937, contained in a journal entry by Rebecca Timbres published in the 1939 book We Didn't Ask Utopia: A Quaker Family in Soviet Russia.[9][non-primary source needed] The first published use of the term brain freeze, in the sense of a cold-stimulus headache, was in 1991.[10][non-primary source needed][a] 7-Eleven has trademarked the term.[11].A cold-stimulus headache is thought to be the direct result of the rapid cooling and rewarming of the capillaries in the sinuses leading to periods of vasoconstriction and vasodilation.A similar, but painless, blood vessel response causes the face to appear \"flushed\" after being outside on a cold day.In both instances, the low temperature causes the capillaries in the sinuses to constrict and then experience extreme rebound dilation as they warm up again.[12].In the palate, this dilation is sensed by nearby pain receptors, which then send signals back to the brain via the trigeminal nerve, one of the major nerves of the facial area.This nerve also senses facial pain, so as the neural signals are conducted the brain interprets the pain as coming from the forehead\u2014the same \"referred pain\" phenomenon seen in heart attacks.Brain-freeze pain may last from a few seconds to a few minutes.Research suggests that the same vascular mechanism and nerve implicated in \"brain freeze\" cause the aura (sensory disturbance) and pulsatile (throbbing pain) phases of migraines.[13].It is possible to have a cold-stimulus headache in both hot and cold weather, because the effect relies upon the temperature of the food being consumed rather than that of the environment.", "Auld Lang Syne": "\"Auld Lang Syne\" (Scots pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0254\u02d0l(d) l\u0251\u014b \u02c8s\u0259i\u032fn]; note [s] rather than [z])[1] is a popular song, particularly in the English-speaking world.Traditionally, it is sung to bid farewell to the old year at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve/Hogmanay.By extension, it is also often heard at funerals, graduations, and as a farewell or ending to other occasions; for instance, many branches of the Scouting movement use it to close jamborees and other functions.[2][3].The text is a Scots-language poem written  by Robert Burns in 1788[4][5] but based on an older Scottish folk song.In 1799, it was set to a traditional tune, which has since become standard.\"Auld Lang Syne\" is listed as numbers 6294 and 13892 in the Roud Folk Song Index..The poem's Scots title may be translated into standard English as \"old long since\" or, less literally, \"long long ago\",[6] \"days gone by\", \"times long past\" or \"old times\".Consequently, \"For auld lang syne\", as it appears in the first line of the chorus, might be loosely translated as \"for the sake of old times\"..The phrase \"Auld Lang Syne\" is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton (1570\u20131638), Allan Ramsay (1686\u20131757), and James Watson (1711), as well as older folk songs predating Burns.[7].In modern times, Matthew Fitt uses the phrase \"in the days of auld lang syne\" as the equivalent of \"once upon a time\" in his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language.[8].Robert Burns sent a copy of the original song to the Scots Musical Museum in 1788 with the remark, \"The following song, an old song, of the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in manuscript until I took it down from an old man.\"[9].Some of the lyrics were indeed \"collected\" rather than composed by the poet; the ballad \"Old Long Syne\" printed in 1711 by James Watson shows considerable similarity in the first verse and the chorus to Burns's later poem,[7] and is almost certainly derived from the same \"old song\"..", "Leeroy Jenkins": "Leeroy Jenkins is a player character created by Ben Schulz in Blizzard Entertainment's multiplayer online video game World of Warcraft.The character became popular in 2005 from his role in a viral video of game footage where, having been absent during his group's discussion of a meticulous battle plan, Leeroy returns and ruins it by charging straight into combat while shouting his own name as a battle cry.The video capturing the character's behavior became an Internet meme.As a result of positive reception to the meme, Blizzard subsequently added Leeroy Jenkins into World of Warcraft as an official non-player character and as a minion card and later as a hero in the online card game Hearthstone..The original video, titled Leeroy!!, was released by the World of Warcraft player guild \"Pals for Life\"[1] to video-sharing site Warcraftmovies on May 11, 2005.[2] The video features a group of players discussing a detailed battle plan for their next encounter while Leeroy is away from his computer, preparing a plate of chicken.This plan is intended to help Leeroy obtain a piece of armor from the boss monsters, but is ruined when Leeroy himself returns and, ignorant of the strategy, utters \"Let's do this!\" then immediately rushes headlong into battle shouting his own name in a stylized battle cry.After his companions sit silent for a moment in disbelief, they try to save him, but the chaotic nature of the fight leads into everyone being killed by the boss monsters.The guild chastises Leeroy for rushing into the fight without any planning, to which he retorts, \"At least I have chicken!\".The Internet meme started with the release of the video clip called A Rough Go[3] to the World of Warcraft game forum in a thread titled \"UBRS (vid) Rookery Overpowered! blue plz.\", which presented the video in a serious context.[4] The thread requested that other players provide help with strategy and that Blizzard reduce the difficulty of the encounter.The video spread as an Internet meme, and Leeroy's response to the other players' chastisements, \"At least I have chicken!\",[3] was also much mimicked..When in April 2008 he was asked about his actions in the video by National Public Radio, Ben Schulz said the players \"were drinking 40s and just yelling at each other.\"[5] As time went on, some began suggesting that the video may have been staged.Schulz had refused to confirm or deny whether the video was staged.[3] Later, in December 2017, Schulz, along with Ben \"Anfrony\" Vinson, the cameraman of the video, released what he described as a first take/dry run of the video.[6] Regarding the video, Vinson stated, \"We didn't think anyone would believe it was real, we thought it was so obviously satire.\"[7].", "BART Police shooting of Oscar Grant": "Oscar Grant III was a 22-year-old African-American man who was killed in the early morning hours of New Year's Day 2009 by BART Police Officer Johannes Mehserle in Oakland, California.Responding to reports of a fight on a crowded Bay Area Rapid Transit train returning from San Francisco, BART Police officers detained Grant and several other passengers on the platform at the Fruitvale BART Station.BART officer Anthony Pirone kneed Grant in the head and forced Grant to lie face down on the platform.Mehserle drew his pistol and shot Grant.Grant was rushed to Highland Hospital in Oakland and pronounced dead later that day.The events were captured on bystanders\u2019 mobile phones.Owners disseminated their footage to media outlets and to various websites where it went viral.Both protests and riots took place in the following days..Some of the other passengers on the train, along with Grant's girlfriend Sophina, were able to break up the fight.Shortly afterward, the train conductor announced to the passengers that the police had been contacted and were on their way to the station at which they were stopped.As the passengers began to exit the train, Grant and his girlfriend saw the police walking towards them and split up.As they got closer to the train, police started to pick out people they believed to have been involved in the fight.", "Harlem Renaissance": "The Harlem Renaissance was an intellectual and cultural revival of African American music, dance, art, fashion, literature, theater, politics and scholarship centered in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, spanning the 1920s and 1930s.At the time, it was known as the \"New Negro Movement\", named after The New Negro, a 1925 anthology edited by Alain Locke.The movement also included the new African American cultural expressions across the urban areas in the Northeast and Midwest United States affected by a renewed militancy in the general struggle for civil rights, combined with the Great Migration of African American workers fleeing the racist conditions of the Jim Crow Deep South,[1] as Harlem was the final destination of the largest number of those who migrated north..Though it was centered in the Harlem neighborhood, many francophone black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the movement,[2][3][4][5] which spanned from about 1918 until the mid-1930s.[6] Many of its ideas lived on much longer.The zenith of this \"flowering of Negro literature\", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, took place between 1924\u2014when Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance\u2014and 1929, the year of the stock-market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression.The Harlem Renaissance is considered to have been a rebirth of the African American arts.[7].Until the end of the Civil War, the majority of African Americans had been enslaved and lived in the South.During the Reconstruction Era, the emancipated African Americans began to strive for civic participation, political equality, and economic and cultural self-determination.Soon after the end of the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 gave rise to speeches by African American Congressmen addressing this Bill.[8] By 1875, sixteen African Americans had been elected and served in Congress and gave numerous speeches with their newfound civil empowerment.[9].The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 was followed by the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, part of Reconstruction legislation by Republicans.During the mid-to-late 1870s, racist whites organized in the Democratic Party launched a murderous campaign of racist terrorism to regain political power throughout the South.From 1890 to 1908, they proceeded to pass legislation that disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites, trapping them without representation.", "History of Africa": "The history of Africa begins with the emergence of hominids, archaic humans and \u2014 around 300,000\u2013250,000 years ago \u2014 anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens), in East Africa, and continues unbroken into the present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.[1] The earliest known recorded history arose in Ancient Egypt,[2] and later in Nubia, the Sahel, the Maghreb, and the Horn of Africa.[3].Following the desertification of the Sahara, North African history became entwined with the Middle East and Southern Europe while the Bantu expansion swept from modern day Cameroon (Central West Africa) across much of the sub-Saharan continent in waves between around 1000 BC and 1 AD, creating a linguistic commonality across much of the central and Southern continent.[4].During the Middle Ages, Islam spread west from Arabia to Egypt, crossing the Maghreb and the Sahel.Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the Ajuran Empire, Bachwezi Empire, D'mt, Adal Sultanate, Alodia, Dagbon Kingdom, Warsangali Sultanate, Buganda Kingdom, Kingdom of Nri, Nok civilization, Mali Empire, Bono State, Songhai Empire, Benin Empire, Oyo Empire, Kingdom of Lunda (Punu-yaka), Ashanti Empire, Ghana Empire, Mossi Kingdoms, Mutapa Empire, Kingdom of Mapungubwe, Kingdom of Sine, Kingdom of Sennar, Kingdom of Saloum, Kingdom of Baol, Kingdom of Cayor, Kingdom of Zimbabwe, Kingdom of Kongo,  Empire of Kaabu, Ife Empire, Ancient Carthage, Numidia, Mauretania, and the Aksumite Empire..At its peak, prior to European colonialism, it is estimated that Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs.[5][6].From the late 15th century, Europeans joined the slave trade.[7] That includes the triangular trade, with the Portuguese initially acquiring slaves through trade and later by force as part of the Atlantic slave trade.They transported enslaved West, Central, and Southern Africans overseas.[8] Subsequently, European colonization of Africa developed rapidly from around 10% (1870) to over 90% (1914) in the Scramble for Africa (1881\u20131914)..However following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the Second World War (1939\u20131945), decolonization took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 Year of Africa.[9].Disciplines such as recording of oral history, historical linguistics, archaeology, and genetics have been vital in rediscovering the great African civilizations of antiquity..The first known hominids evolved in Africa.According to paleontology, the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the gorilla and the chimpanzee, great apes that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a bipedal locomotion which freed their hands.This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open savanna at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas.", "Hitting for the cycle": "In baseball, hitting for the cycle is the accomplishment of one batter who hits a single, a double, a triple, and a home run in the same game.Collecting the hits in that order is known as a \"natural cycle\".[1] Cycles are rare in Major League Baseball (MLB), having occurred only 344 times, starting with Curry Foley in 1882.[2][3] The most recent cycle in MLB was accomplished by Jos\u00e9 Altuve of the Houston Astros on August 28, 2023..The cycle is about as uncommon as a no-hitter;[4][5] it has been called \"one of the rarest\"[6] and \"most difficult feats\"[7] in baseball.Based on 2009 offensive levels, the probability of an average MLB player hitting for a cycle against an average team in a game is about 0.0059%; this corresponds to about 21\u20442 cycles in a 162-game season with 30 teams.[8] The most cycles hit in a single major league season is eight, which occurred in both 1933 and 2009.[3].In other baseball leagues, the cycle is achieved less frequently.Through June 2022, there have been 76 cycles hit in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB),[9] the top-level baseball organization in Japan, most recently by Yasutaka Shiomi on September 18, 2021.[10] One NPB player, Atsuya Furuta, has hit for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game.No player has ever hit for the cycle in the MLB All-Star Game.[11] One MLB player has hit for the cycle in a postseason game: Brock Holt of the Boston Red Sox in Game 3 of the 2018 ALDS.[12].Two players have hit for the cycle on the same day once in NPB history; this has occurred twice in MLB history.There have never been multiple cycles completed in a single MLB or NPB game; this is known to have occurred twice in Minor League Baseball: on April 11, 2018, by Gio Brusa and Jalen Miller of the Class A-Advanced San Jose Giants,[13] and on August 7, 2018, by Kevin Newman and Jacob Stallings of the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians.[14].Under Major League Baseball Rule 6.09(a), the \"batter becomes a runner when he hits a fair ball\".[15] The single\u2014in which the batter reaches first base without being put out, and without the benefit of a fielding error\u2014is the most common type of hit in baseball: for example, there were 25,838 singles hit during the 1988 MLB season, compared to 6,386 doubles, 840 triples, or 3,180 home runs.[16] The MLB leader in singles is Pete Rose, who is also the league's all-time hit leader.[17] The single-season leader in singles is Ichiro Suzuki, who broke Willie Keeler's 106-year-old record in 2004 by notching 225, 19 more than the previous record.[18] None of the top five players in singles (Rose, Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, Cap Anson, and Keeler) in MLB history have hit for the cycle;[3] of those five, only Rose had more than 150 home runs,[19] and two (Collins and Keeler), who both played during the dead-ball era, had fewer than 50,[20][21] lessening the probability of their completing the cycle..A double is a hit in which the batter reaches second base without being put out, and without the benefit of a fielding error.This scenario often occurs when a ball is hit into the gaps between the outfielders, or down the foul line on either side of the playing field.[22] Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792,[23] one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St.", "Windows Task Manager": "Task Manager, previously known as Windows Task Manager, is a task manager, system monitor, and startup manager included with Microsoft Windows systems.It provides information about computer performance and running software, including name of running processes, CPU and GPU load, commit charge, I/O details, logged-in users, and Windows services.Task Manager can also be used to set process priorities, processor affinity, start and stop services, and forcibly terminate processes..The program can be started in recent versions of Windows by pressing \u229e Win+R and then typing in taskmgr.exe,or by typing launchtm.exe, or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete and clicking Task Manager, by pressing Ctrl+\u21e7 Shift+Esc, by using Windows Search in the Start Menu and typing taskmgr, by right-clicking on the Windows taskbar and selecting \"Task Manager\", by typing taskmgr in the File Explorer address bar, or by typing taskmgr in Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell..Task Manager was introduced in its current form with Windows NT 4.0.Prior versions of Windows NT, as well as Windows 3.x, include the Task List application, are capable of listing currently running processes and killing them, or creating new processes.Windows 9x has a program known as Close Program which lists the programs currently running and offers options to close programs as well shut down the computer.[2].Since Windows 8, Task Manager has two views.The first time Task Manager is invoked by a user, it shows in a simplified summary mode (described in the user experience as Fewer Details).It can be switched to a more detailed mode by clicking More Details.This setting is remembered for that user on that machine.[3].Since at least Windows 2000, the CPU usage can be displayed as a tray icon in the task bar for quick glance.[4][5].", "The Troop": "The Troop is an action-comedy children's television series centered around a trio of teenagers who fight monsters that invade the fictional town of Lakewood.Created and executive produced by Max Burnett, Greg Coolidge and Chris Morgan, the series premiered on Nickelodeon on September 12, 2009..The second season premiered on June 25, 2011, and Nickelodeon cancelled it midway through its airing.The remaining episodes premiered sporadically on NickToons throughout 2012 and 2013..The show revolves around Jake, a high school student who, after scoring well on an aptitude test, is recruited by his administrator to join \"The Troop\", a secret worldwide organization which protects the world from monsters and other supernatural phenomena.[1] Additional team members include his fellow students, Hayley, the most popular girl in school, and Felix, the school's main nerd.Teenagers are chosen for The Troop because their young minds are malleable to the strange things of the world, but old enough to understand the responsibilities such a job entails, as it is depicted the older one gets the more frightening monsters become.The show has been described as \"Men in Black at a suburban high school\".[2][3].The initial pilot was shot in 2008 before being re-shot with a new cast (minus Purcell).[4] The show premiered to 3.5 million viewers on September 12, 2009 (premiering as a \"Special Preview\") right after iCarly's \"iThink They Kissed\".[5] The show officially premiered a week later.A companion website, troopgrid.com, was launched alongside the show, featuring character and creature profiles based on real concept drawings the crew used to model the monsters.In March 2010, the series was picked up for a second season.[6].On October 15, 2010, it was announced that Malese Jow and Matt Shively would join the second season's cast.[7] In January 2011, David Del Rio announced that he would not be renewing his contract for the second season due to other commitments and would become a recurring cast member after episode 28..The Troop aired on Nickelodeon and premiered in the United States on September 12, 2009.", "Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo": "The economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has declined drastically around the 1980s,[16] despite being home to vast potential in natural resources and mineral wealth; their gross domestic product is $69.474 billion as of 2023..At the time of its independence in 1960, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was the second most industrialized country in Africa after South Africa.It boasted a thriving mining sector and its agriculture sector was relatively productive.[17] Since then, decades of corruption, war, and political instability have been a severe detriment to further growth, today leaving DRC with a GDP per capita and a HDI rating that rank among the world's lowest and make the DRC one of the most fragile and according to United Nations, least developed countries in the world..Despite this the DRC is quickly modernizing; it tied with Malaysia for the largest positive change in HDI development in 2016.Government projects include strengthening the health system for maternal and child health, expansion of electricity access, water supply reconstructions, and urban and social rehabilitation programs..The two recent conflicts (the First and Second Congo Wars), which began in 1996, have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue,[16] have increased external debt,[16] and have resulted in deaths of more than five million people from war, and associated famine and disease.[18] Malnutrition affects approximately two-thirds of the country's population.[19].Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for 57.9% of GDP in 1997.[20] In 1996, agriculture employed 66% of the work force.[20].Rich in minerals, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has a difficult history of predatory mineral extraction, which has been at the heart of many struggles within the country for many decades, but particularly in the 1990s.The economy of the second largest country in Africa relies heavily on mining.However, much economic activity occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in GDP data.[21].In 2006 Transparency International ranked the Democratic Republic of the Congo 156 out of 163 countries in the Corruption Perception Index, tying Bangladesh, Chad, and Sudan with a 2.0 rating.[22] President Joseph Kabila established the Commission of Repression of Economic Crimes upon his ascension to power in 2001.[23].The conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo were over water, minerals, and other resources.", "Afterimage": "An afterimage is an image that continues to appear in the eyes after a period of exposure to the original image.An afterimage may be a normal phenomenon (physiological afterimage) or may be pathological (palinopsia).Illusory palinopsia may be a pathological exaggeration of physiological afterimages.Afterimages occur because photochemical activity in the retina continues even when the eyes are no longer experiencing the original stimulus.[1][2].The remainder of this article refers to physiological afterimages.A common physiological afterimage is the dim area that seems to float before one's eyes after briefly looking into a light source, such as a camera flash.Palinopsia is a common symptom of visual snow..Negative afterimages are primarily caused by neural adaptation of the cells that carry signals from the retina of the eye to the rest of the brain, the retinal ganglion cells.[3] There is also a small contribution when the eye's photoreceptors, the rods and cones, adapt to overstimulation and lose sensitivity.[4] There is brain contribution as well.[5].Normally, any image is moved over the retina by small eye movements known as microsaccades before much adaptation can occur.However, if the image is very intense and brief, or if the image is large, or if the eye remains very steady, these small movements cannot keep the image on unadapted parts of the retina..Afterimages can be seen when moving from a bright environment to a dim one, like walking indoors on a bright snowy day.They are accompanied by neural adaptation in the occipital lobe of the brain that function similar to color balance adjustments in photography.", "List of Lost episodes": "A total of 121 Lost episodes aired between September 22, 2004, and May 23, 2010.J.J.Abrams, who co-created the American serial drama television series Lost with Damon Lindelof, directed the pilot episode, which was based upon an original script titled Nowhere written by Jeffrey Lieber.[1] Six seasons of the show aired, in addition to numerous clip shows to recap previous episodes..The series follows the experiences of the survivors of a plane crash on a passenger jet, Oceanic Flight 815, which crashed on a tropical island in the South Pacific, with each episode typically featuring action on the island as well as a secondary storyline from another point in a character's life.The series also includes stories of the lives of people already living on the island \u2014 they include the \"Others\", who initially antagonize the survivors, as well as a group of people who arrive on the freighter Kahana.Lost: Missing Pieces consists of thirteen original two- to three-minute clips referred to as \"mobisodes\" which were produced for cell phones and released between seasons three and four.Multiple former and recurring cast members made an appearance in the series finale..In the following list, the term \"featured character(s)\" refers to the character or characters who are featured in the secondary storyline of each episode..Season one aired from September 22, 2004, to May 25, 2005.In addition to the twenty-four regular episodes in season one, a special, \"Lost: The Journey\", aired on April 27, 2005, to put the mysteries of the island and the characters in perspective in the lead-up to the season finale..Season one begins when a plane crash strands the surviving passengers of Oceanic Flight 815 on a seemingly deserted tropical island, forcing the group of strangers to work together to stay alive.", "Flat feet": "Flat feet, also called pes planus or fallen arches, is a postural deformity in which the arches of the foot collapse, with the entire sole of the foot coming into complete or near-complete contact with the ground.Sometimes children are born with flat feet (congenital).There is a functional relationship between the structure of the arch of the foot and the biomechanics of the lower leg.The arch provides an elastic, springy connection between the forefoot and the hind foot so that a majority of the forces incurred during weight bearing on the foot can be dissipated before the force reaches the long bones of the leg and thigh.[1].In pes planus, the head of the talus bone is displaced medially and distal from the navicular bone.As a result, the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (spring ligament) and the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle are stretched to the extent that the individual with pes planus loses the function of the medial longitudinal arch (MLA).If the MLA is absent or nonfunctional in both the seated and standing positions, the individual has \"rigid\" flatfoot.If the MLA is present and functional while the individual is sitting or standing up on their toes, but this arch disappears when assuming a foot-flat stance, the individual has \"supple\" flatfoot.This latter condition is often treated with arch supports.[1].Studies have shown flat feet are a common occurrence in children and adolescents.The human arch develops in infancy and early childhood as part of normal muscle, tendon, ligament and bone growth.[2]  Flat arches in children usually become high arches as the child progresses through adolescence and into adulthood.Children with flat feet are at a higher risk of developing knee, hip, and back pain.", "Generation X": "Generation X (often shortened to Gen X) is the demographic cohort following the baby boomers and preceding Millennials.Researchers and popular media use the mid-to-late 1960s as starting birth years and the late 1970s to early 1980s as ending birth years, with the generation being generally defined as people born from 1965 to 1980.[1] By this definition and U.S.Census data, there are 65.2 million Gen Xers[2] in the United States as of 2019.[3] Most members of Generation X are the children of the Silent Generation and early boomers;[4][5] Xers are also often the parents of millennials[4] and Generation Z.[6].As children in the 1970s and 1980s, a time of shifting societal values, Gen Xers were sometimes called the \"latchkey generation\", which stems from their returning as children to an empty home and needing to use the door key.This was a result of increasing divorce rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce prior to widespread availability of childcare options outside the home..As adolescents and young adults in the 1980s and 1990s, Xers were dubbed the \"MTV Generation\" (a reference to the music video channel), sometimes being characterized as slackers, cynical, and disaffected.Some of the many cultural influences on Gen X youth included a proliferation of musical genres with strong social-tribal identity such as punk, post-punk, and heavy metal, in addition to later forms developed by Gen Xers themselves (e.g., grunge, grindcore and related genres).Film, both the birth of franchise mega-sequels and a proliferation of independent film (enabled in part by video) was also a notable cultural influence.Video games both in amusement parlours and in devices in western homes were also a major part of juvenile entertainment for the first time.Politically, in many Eastern Bloc countries, Generation X experienced the last days of communism and transition to capitalism as part of its youth.In much of the western world, a similar time period was defined by a dominance of conservatism and free market economics..In midlife during the early 21st century, research describes them as active, happy, and achieving a work\u2013life balance.", "Pressure ulcer": "Pressure ulcers, also known as pressure sores, bed sores or pressure injuries, are localised damage to the skin and/or underlying tissue that usually occur over a bony prominence as a result of usually long-term pressure, or pressure in combination with shear or friction.The most common sites are the skin overlying the sacrum, coccyx, heels, and hips, though other sites can be affected, such as the elbows, knees, ankles, back of shoulders, or the back of the cranium..Pressure ulcers occur due to pressure applied to soft tissue resulting in completely or partially obstructed blood flow to the soft tissue.Shear is also a cause, as it can pull on blood vessels that feed the skin.Pressure ulcers most commonly develop in individuals who are not moving about, such as those who are on chronic bedrest or consistently use a wheelchair.It is widely believed that other factors can influence the tolerance of skin for pressure and shear, thereby increasing the risk of pressure ulcer development.These factors are protein-calorie malnutrition, microclimate (skin wetness caused by sweating or incontinence), diseases that reduce blood flow to the skin, such as arteriosclerosis, or diseases that reduce the sensation in the skin, such as paralysis or neuropathy.The healing of pressure ulcers may be slowed by the age of the person, medical conditions (such as arteriosclerosis, diabetes or infection), smoking or medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs..Although often prevented and treatable if detected early, pressure ulcers can be very difficult to prevent in critically ill people, frail elders, and individuals with impaired mobility such as wheelchair users (especially where spinal injury is involved).Primary prevention is to redistribute pressure by regularly turning the person.The benefit of turning to avoid further sores is well documented since at least the 19th century.[1] In addition to turning and re-positioning the person in the bed or wheelchair, eating a balanced diet with adequate protein[2] and keeping the skin free from exposure to urine and stool is important.[3].The rate of pressure ulcers in hospital settings is high; the prevalence in European hospitals ranges from 8.3% to 23%, and the prevalence was 26% in Canadian healthcare settings from 1990 to 2003.[4] In 2013, there were 29,000 documented deaths from pressure ulcers globally, up from 14,000 deaths in 1990.[5].", "Overboard (film)": "Overboard is a 2018 American romantic comedy film directed by Rob Greenberg, who wrote the screenplay with Bob Fisher and Leslie Dixon.A characteristically-reversed remake of the original 1987 film, the film stars Eugenio Derbez, Anna Faris, Eva Longoria and John Hannah.It follows a struggling, working-class single mother who convinces a rich playboy with amnesia that they are married..Overboard was released in the United States on May 4, 2018, and grossed $91 million worldwide against a budget of $12 million.The film received unfavorable reviews from critics, who praised Faris' comedic performance but criticized the story as mediocre and failing to distinguish itself from the original..Kate Sullivan is a widowed single mother of three daughters who works two jobs while studying to be a nurse.Assigned to clean carpets on a yacht owned by spoiled, arrogant playboy Leonardo 'Leo' Montenegro, he makes rude remarks to her, firing her without pay when she refuses to bring him food.When Kate calls out his behavior, he pushes her off the boat with the cleaning equipment..Meanwhile, in Mexico, Leo's younger sisters Magdalena and Sofia are tending their ailing father, who announces Leo as his successor to run their company.That night, Leo slips off the yacht and falls into the ocean unnoticed.Waking up on a beach with amnesia and no recollection of his identity, he wanders through town and is eventually brought to the hospital.Magdalena finds him, but leaves him there unclaimed after learning of his amnesia.", "Green Bay, Wisconsin": "Green Bay (/\u0261rin \u02c8be\u026a/ green BAY)[12] is a city in the U.S.state of Wisconsin.The county seat of Brown County, it is at the head of Green Bay (known locally as \"the bay of Green Bay\"), a sub-basin of Lake Michigan, at the mouth of the Fox River.As of the 2020 Census, Green Bay had a population of 107,395, making it the 3rd most populous city in Wisconsin, after Milwaukee and Madison, and the third-largest city on Lake Michigan, after Chicago and Milwaukee.[13].Green Bay is the principal city of the Green Bay Metropolitan Statistical Area, which covers Brown, Kewaunee, and Oconto counties.[14] Green Bay is well known for being the home city of the National Football League (NFL)'s Green Bay Packers..Samuel de Champlain, the founder of New France, commissioned Jean Nicolet to form a peaceful alliance with Native Americans in the western areas, whose unrest interfered with the French fur trade, and to search for a shorter trade route to China through Canada.Nicolet and others had learned from other First Nations of the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) people, who identified as \"People of the Sea\", and believed they must reside on or near an Ocean.[15] Champlain had also heard about natural resources in the area, including fertile soil, forests, and animals.Nicolet began his journey for this new land shortly before winter in 1634.[16] In what later became a French fur-trading route, he sailed up the Ottawa River, through Lake Nipissing and down the French River to Lake Huron, then through the straits of Michilimackinac into Lake Michigan.He is believed to have landed at Red Banks, near the site of the modern-day city of Green Bay, Wisconsin.[17].Nicolet founded a small trading post here in 1634, originally named La Baye or La Baie des Puants (French for \"the Bay of Stinking Waters\").[18] Nicolet's settlement was one of the oldest European permanent settlements in America.[19].When Nicolet arrived in the Green Bay area, he encountered the Menominee, who occupied this territory.He also met the Ho-Chunk (also known as the Winnebago), a people who spoke a Siouan language..", "Luteinizing hormone": "Luteinizing hormone (LH, also known as luteinising hormone[1], lutropin and sometimes lutrophin[2]) is a hormone produced by gonadotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland.The production of LH is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.[3] In females, an acute rise of LH known as an LH surge, triggers ovulation[4] and development of the corpus luteum.In males, where LH had also been called interstitial cell\u2013stimulating hormone (ICSH),[5] it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone.[4] It acts synergistically with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)..LH  is a heterodimeric glycoprotein.Each monomeric unit is a  glycoprotein molecule; one alpha and one beta subunit make the full, functional protein..Its structure is similar to that of the other glycoprotein hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).The protein dimer contains 2 glycopeptidic subunits (labeled alpha- and beta- subunits) that are non-covalently associated:[6].The different composition of these oligosaccharides affects bioactivity and speed of degradation.The biologic half-life of LH is 20 minutes, shorter than that of  FSH (3\u20134 hours) and hCG (24 hours).[citation needed] The biological half-life of LH is 23 hours subcutaneous[7] or terminal half life of 10-12 hours.[8].The gene for the alpha subunit is located on chromosome 6q12.21..The luteinizing hormone beta subunit gene is localized in the LHB/CGB gene cluster on chromosome 19q13.32.In contrast to the alpha gene activity, beta LH subunit gene activity is restricted to the pituitary gonadotropic cells.", "Selena": "Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez (Spanish pronunciation: [se\u02c8lena kinta\u02c8ni\u029da \u02c8pe\u027ees]; April 16, 1971 \u2013 March 31, 1995) was an American singer.Referred to as the \"Queen of Tejano Music\", her contributions to music and fashion made her one of the most celebrated Mexican-American entertainers of the late 20th century.In 2020, Billboard magazine put her in third place on their list of \"Greatest Latino Artists of All Time\", based on both Latin albums and Latin songs chart.[3] Media outlets called her the \"Tejano Madonna\" for her clothing choices.[a] She also ranks among the most influential Latin artists of all time and is credited for catapulting the Tejano genre into the mainstream market.[8][9].The youngest child of the Quintanilla family, she debuted on the music scene as a member of the band Selena y Los Dinos, which also included her elder siblings A.B.Quintanilla and Suzette Quintanilla.In the 1980s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across Texas for performing Tejano music\u2014a male-dominated music genre.However, her popularity grew after she won the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1987, which she won nine consecutive times.She signed with EMI Latin in 1989 and released her self-titled debut album the same year, while her brother became her principal music producer and songwriter..Selena released Entre a Mi Mundo (1992), which peaked at number one on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart for eight consecutive months.The album's commercial success led music critics to call it the \"breakthrough\" recording of her musical career.One of its singles, \"Como la Flor\", became one of her most popular signature songs.Live! (1993) won Best Mexican/American Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards, becoming the first recording by a female Tejano artist to do so.", "Stahlhelm": "The Stahlhelm ('steel helmet') is a German military steel combat helmet intended to provide protection against shrapnels and fragments or shards of grenades.The term Stahlhelm refers both to a generic steel helmet and more specifically to the distinctive German military design..The armies of major European powers introduced helmets of this type during World War I.The German Army began to replace the traditional boiled leather Pickelhaube ('spiked helmet') with the Stahlhelm in 1916.The Stahlhelm, with its distinctive \"coal scuttle\" shape, was instantly recognizable and became a common element of propaganda on both sides, just like the Pickelhaube before it.The name was also used by Der Stahlhelm, a post\u2013World War I organization for German ex-servicemen that existed from 1918 to 1935.After World War II, the German Bundeswehr (English: Federal Armed Forces) and Nationale Volksarmee (English: National People's Army) continued to call their standard helmets Stahlhelm, but in Bundeswehr the design was based on the American M1 helmet, while the National Volksarmee's M56 helmet was modelled on an unused 1942-1943 German design.The Bundesgrenzschutz (English: Federal Border Service), however, continued to use the original German design, until both troops switched to the new M92 Aramid helmet.[clarification needed][1].At the beginning of World War I, none of the combatants were issued with any form of protection for the head other than cloth and leather caps, designed at most to protect against sabre cuts.When trench warfare began, the number of casualties on all sides suffering from severe head wounds (more often caused by shrapnel bullets or shell fragments than by gunfire) increased dramatically, since the head was typically the most exposed part of the body when in a trench.The French were the first to see a need for more protection\u2014in mid-1915 they began to issue Adrian helmets to their troops.[2][3] The British and Commonwealth troops followed with the Brodie helmet (a development of which was also later worn by US forces) and the Germans with the Stahlhelm..As the German army hesitated to develop effective head protection, some units developed provisional, makeshift helmets in 1915.", "Glow-in-the-dark": "", "Airline hub": "An airline hub or hub airport is an airport used by one or more airlines to concentrate passenger traffic and flight operations.Hubs serve as transfer (or stop-over) points to help get passengers to their final destination.[a][b] It is part of the hub-and-spoke system.An airline may operate flights from several non-hub (spoke) cities to the hub airport, and passengers traveling between spoke cities connect through the hub.This paradigm creates economies of scale that allow an airline to serve (via an intermediate connection) city-pairs that could otherwise not be economically served on a non-stop basis.This system contrasts with the point-to-point model, in which there are no hubs and nonstop flights are instead offered between spoke cities.Hub airports also serve origin and destination (O&D) traffic..The hub-and-spoke system allows an airline to serve fewer routes, so fewer aircraft are needed.[3] The system also increases passenger loads; a flight from a hub to a spoke carries not just passengers originating at the hub, but also passengers originating at multiple spoke cities.[4] However, the system is costly.Additional employees and facilities are needed to cater to connecting passengers.To serve spoke cities of varying populations and demand, an airline requires several aircraft types, and specific training and equipment are necessary for each type.[3] In addition, airlines may experience capacity constraints as they expand at their hub airports.[4][5].For the passenger, the hub-and-spoke system offers one-stop air service to a wide array of destinations.[3][6] However, it requires having to regularly make connections en route to their final destination, which increases travel time.[6] Additionally, airlines can come to monopolise their hubs (fortress hubs), allowing them to freely increase fares as passengers have no alternative.[4] High domestic connectivity in the United States is achieved through airport location and hub dominance.The top 10 megahubs in the US are dominated by American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, the three largest United States-based airlines.[7].Airlines may operate banks of flights at their hubs, in which several flights arrive and depart within short periods of time.", "Sparta": "Sparta[1] was a prominent city-state in Laconia in ancient Greece.In antiquity, the city-state was known as Lacedaemon (\u039b\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd, Lakeda\u00edm\u014dn), while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese.[2] Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece..Given its military pre-eminence, Sparta was recognized as the leading force of the unified Greek military during the Greco-Persian Wars, in rivalry with the rising naval power of Athens.[3] Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BC),[4] from which it emerged victorious after the Battle of Aegospotami.The decisive Battle of Leuctra against Thebes in 371BC ended the Spartan hegemony, although the city-state maintained its political independence until its forced integration into the Achaean League in 192 BC.The city nevertheless recovered much autonomy after the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC and prospered during the Roman Empire, as its antiquarian customs attracted many Roman tourists.However, Sparta was sacked in 396AD by the Visigothic king Alaric, and underwent a long period of decline, especially in the Middle Ages, when many of its citizens moved to Mystras.Modern Sparta is the capital of the southern Greek region of Laconia and a center for processing citrus and olives..Sparta was unique in ancient Greece for its social system and constitution, which were supposedly introduced by the semi-mythical legislator Lycurgus.His laws configured the Spartan society to maximize military proficiency at all costs, focusing all social institutions on military training and physical development.The inhabitants of Sparta were stratified as Spartiates (citizens with full rights), mothakes (free non-Spartiate people descended from Spartans), perioikoi (free non-Spartiates), and helots (state-owned enslaved non-Spartan locals).Spartiate men underwent the rigorous agoge training regimen, and Spartan phalanx brigades were widely considered to be among the best in battle.Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights than elsewhere in classical antiquity..", "Fantasy football (American)": "Fantasy football is a game in which the participants serve as owners and general managers of virtual professional American football teams.The competitors select their rosters by participating in a draft in which all relevant National Football League (NFL) players are available.Fantasy points are awarded in weekly matchups based on the actual performances of football players in real-world competition.The game typically involves the NFL, but can also involve other leagues, such as the Canadian Football League or NCAA..There are three main types of fantasy football:.Fantasy football is often played in small groups of mutually familiar individuals who may or may not be playing for money.However, online fantasy contests, particularly those run by daily fantasy companies, regularly involve large groups of people who otherwise do not know each other contributing to a shared betting pool.The structure of these games has led some jurisdictions to characterize and regulate online fantasy contents as a form of gambling.[3].Have you ever wondered what it would be like to own and coach your own NFL franchise? This is the dream of every Monday-morning quarterback.We've all snarled our share of \"If I ran that team...\" Now, thousands of fans have a way to display their coaching and general managing expertise\u2014or lack of it..Glenn Ferry, Inside Sports[4].Modern fantasy football can be traced back to Wilfred \"Bill\" Winkenbach, an Oakland, California businessman and limited partner in the Oakland Raiders.", "Gold bar": "A gold bar, also called gold bullion or gold ingot, is a quantity of refined metallic gold of any shape that is made by a bar producer meeting standard conditions of manufacture, labeling, and record keeping.Larger gold bars that are produced by pouring the molten metal into molds are called ingots.Smaller bars may be manufactured by minting or stamping from appropriately rolled gold sheets.The standard gold bar held as gold reserves by central banks and traded among bullion dealers is the 400-troy-ounce (438.9-ounce; 27.4-pound; 12.4-kilogram) Good Delivery gold bar.The kilobar, which is 1,000 grams (32.15 troy ounces) in mass, and a 100 troy ounce gold bar are the bars that are more manageable and are used extensively for trading and investment.[1] The premium on these bars when traded is very low over the spot value of the gold, making it ideal for small transfers between banks and traders.Most kilobars are flat, although some investors, particularly in Europe, prefer the brick shape.[2].Based upon how they are manufactured, gold bars are categorized as having been cast or minted, with both differing in their appearance and price.[1] Cast bars are created in a similar method to that of ingots, whereby molten gold is poured into a bar-shaped mold and left to solidify.This process often leads to malformed bars with uneven surfaces which, although imperfect, make each bar unique and easier to identify.Cast bars are also cheaper than minted bars, because they are quicker to produce and require less handling..Minted bars are made from gold blanks that have been cut to a required dimension from a flat piece of gold.These are identified by having smooth and even surfaces..To prevent bars from being counterfeited or stolen, manufacturers have developed ways to verify genuine bars, with the most common way being to brand bars with registered serial numbers or providing a certificate of authenticity.", "Archie Manning": "Elisha Archibald Manning III (born May 19, 1949) is an American former football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons, primarily with the New Orleans Saints from 1971 to 1982.He also had brief stints with the Houston Oilers and the Minnesota Vikings.He played college football for the Ole Miss Rebels and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1989.Manning is the patriarch of the Manning football dynasty, having preceded sons Peyton and Eli as successful NFL quarterbacks..Born in Drew, Mississippi, Manning was the son of Jane Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Nelson) and Elisha Archibald Manning Jr.He grew up heavily involved in football, basketball, baseball, and track.His father, known as \"Buddy\", was interested in Archie's sports activities, but the nature of his job left him little if any time for attending games.Instead, Archie III drew his inspiration from a local high school sports star, James Hobson.[1] His mother was \"a ubiquitous presence at all of his games, no matter what the sport or level.\"[2] Manning attended Drew High School.[3] Manning was selected in the Major League Baseball draft four times, first in 1967 by the Braves, twice by the White Sox, and finally by the Royals in 1971.[4] In the summer of 1969, his father, Buddy Manning, committed suicide.Archie, who was home from college for summer vacation, was the first to discover Buddy's body.In the biopic-documentary Book of Manning, Manning said that he considered dropping out and getting a job to support his mother and sister, but his mother persuaded him to return to college and not put his rising football career to waste..Manning attended the University of Mississippi in Oxford and was the starting quarterback at Ole Miss for three years.In the first national prime time broadcast of a college football game (on ABC, October 4, 1969), Manning threw 436 yards and three touchdowns, also rushing for 104 yards, in a 33\u201332 loss to Alabama..", "Advocacy": "Advocacy is an activity by an individual or group that aims to influence decisions within political, economic, and social institutions.Advocacy includes activities and publications to influence public policy, laws and budgets by using facts, their relationships, the media, and messaging to educate government officials and the public.Advocacy can include many activities that a person or organization undertakes, including media campaigns, public speaking, commissioning and publishing research.Lobbying (often by lobby groups) is a form of advocacy where a direct approach is made to legislators on a specific issue or specific piece of legislation.[1] Research[whose?] has started to address how advocacy groups in the United States[2] and Canada[3] are using social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action..There are several forms of advocacy, each representing a different approach in a way to initiate changes in the society.One of the most popular forms is social justice advocacy.[4] Cohen, de la Vega, and Watson (2001) state that this definition does not encompass the notions of power relations, people's participation, and a vision of a just society as promoted by social justice advocates.For them, advocacy represents the series of actions taken and issues highlighted to change the \u201cwhat is\u201d into a \u201cwhat should be\u201d, considering that this \u201cwhat should be\u201d is a more decent and a more just society [4] Those actions, which vary with the political, economic and social environment in which they are conducted, have several points in common.[4] For instance, they:.Other forms of advocacy include:.Different contexts in which advocacy is used:.Margaret E.Keck and Kathryn Sikkink have observed four types of advocacy tactics:.These tactics have been also observed within advocacy organizations outside the USA.[8].", "Flag of Mexico": "The national flag of Mexico (Spanish: Bandera de M\u00e9xico) is a vertical tricolor of  green, white, and red with the national coat of arms charged in the center of the white stripe.While the meaning of the colors has changed over time, these three colors were adopted by Mexico following independence from Spain during the country's War of Independence, and subsequent First Mexican Empire..Red, white, and green are the colors of the national army in Mexico.The central emblem is the Mexican coat of arms, based on the Aztec symbol for Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), the center of the Aztec Empire.It recalls the legend of an eagle sitting on a  cactus while devouring a serpent that signaled to the Aztecs where to found their city, Tenochtitlan.[1].Before the adoption of the first national flag, various flags were used during the War of Independence from Spain.Though it was never adopted as an official flag, many historians consider the first Mexican flag to be the Standard of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was carried by Miguel Hidalgo after the Grito de Dolores on September 16, 1810.[2] The Standard became the initial symbol of the rebel army during the Mexican War of Independence.Various other Standards were used during the war.Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos used a flag with an image of the Virgin to which was added a blue and white insignia with a crowned eagle on a cactus over a three-arched bridge and the letters V.V.M.(Viva la Virgen Mar\u00eda\u2013 \"long live the Virgin Mary\").[2] The Revolutionary Army also used a flag featuring the colors white, blue and red in vertical stripes.The first use of the modern colors\u2014green, white and red\u2014was in the flag of the unified Army of the Three Guarantees (pictured above) after independence from Spain was won.[3][dubious  \u2013 discuss].While similar to the national flag that is used today, the eagle in these arms is not holding a serpent in his talons and a crown has been affixed to the head of the eagle to signify the Empire.", "Destination marketing organization": "A destination marketing organization (DMO) is an organisation which promotes a location as an attractive travel destination.DMOs are known as tourist boards, tourism authorities or \"Convention and Visitors Bureaux\".[1] They primarily exist to provide information to leisure travellers.Additionally, where a suitable infrastructure exists, they encourage event organisers to choose their location for meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions, collectively abbreviated as MICE.[1][2].DMOs are generally tied to the local government infrastructure, often with supporting funds being generated by specific taxes, such as hotel taxes, membership fees, and sometimes government subsidies.[1] However, in many cases, the observed decline in tourism following cutbacks to public-sector expenditures has motivated the tourism industry to create a private sector coalition in order to provide the functions of a DMO.[3][4].Main

subspecies.The elk (pl.: elk or elks; Cervus canadensis), or wapiti, is one of the largest species within the deer family, Cervidae, and one of the largest terrestrial mammals in its native range of North America and Central and East Asia.The word \"elk\" originally referred to the European variety of the moose, Alces alces, but was transferred to Cervus canadensis by North American colonists.The name \"wapiti\" derives from a Shawnee and Cree word meaning \"white rump\" for the distinctive light fur in the rear region..Elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark.Male elk have large antlers, which they shed each year.Males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the rut, including posturing, antler wrestling (sparring), and bugling, a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females.Although it is currently native to North America and central/eastern Asia, it had a much broader distribution in the past.Populations were present across Eurasia into Western Europe during the Late Pleistocene and survived into the early Holocene in southern Sweden and the Alps; the extinct Merriam's elk subspecies ranged into Mexico.The elk has adapted well to countries where it has been introduced, including Argentina and New Zealand.Its adaptability may, in fact, threaten endemic species and the ecosystems into which it encounters..Elk are susceptible to several infectious diseases, some of which can be transmitted to livestock.", "George Washington University": "The George Washington University (GW or GWU) is a private federally chartered research university in Washington, D.C.Chartered in 1821 by the United States Congress, GW is one of six universities in the United States with a congressional charter.[7][8].GW is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very High Research Activity.\"[9] It is a member of the Association of American Universities.[10] The university offers degree programs in seventy-one disciplines, enrolling around 11,500 undergraduate and 15,000 graduate students.[11] The school's athletic teams, the George Washington Revolutionaries, play in the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference.GW also annually hosts numerous political events, including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's Annual Meetings.[12].The university's alumni, faculty, and affiliates include 16 foreign heads of state or government, 28 United States senators, 27 United States governors, 18 U.S.Cabinet members, five Nobel laureates, two Olympic medalists, two Academy Award winners, and a Golden Globe winner.[13] GW has over 1,100 active alumni in the U.S.Foreign Service and is one of the largest feeder schools for the diplomatic corps.[14].The first President of the United States, George Washington, long favored the establishment of a university in a central part of the United States.[15] He wrote to the U.S.Congress and others in favor of it, and envisioned it would be in a central part of D.C., stating he hoped the university would educate the most promising students from across the country while reaping the benefits of the nation's capital.[15] Washington included a bequest of his shares in the Potomac Company in his last will and testament, though the shares lost their value and no educational institution ever benefited from them.[16][17] His desire was shared and encouraged after his death by Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, and they expressed the need to carry out Washington's plans.[18] Finally, in 1821 the Baptist missionary and leading minister Luther Rice secured funds from James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, John C.Calhoun and other benefactors for a college to educate citizens from throughout the young nation in Washington, D.C.A large building was constructed on College Hill, which is now known as Meridian Hill, and on February 9, 1821, President Monroe approved the congressional charter creating the non-denominational Columbian College.[19] Washingtonians, Congress and the academic community celebrated this new institution as the fulfillment of Washington's vision.[16] The first commencement in 1824 was considered an important event for the young city of Washington, D.C.In attendance were President Monroe, John C.", "Lion": "The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.It is a social species, forming groups called prides.A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates.The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans..The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs and shrublands.It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight.During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India.It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s.Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas.", "History of video game consoles (seventh generation)": "The seventh generation of home video game consoles began on November 22, 2005, with the release of Microsoft's Xbox 360 home console.This was followed by the release of Sony's PlayStation 3 on November 17, 2006, and Nintendo's Wii on November 19, 2006.Each new console introduced new technologies.The Xbox 360 offered games rendered natively at high-definition video (HD) resolutions, the PlayStation 3 offered HD movie playback via a built-in 3D Blu-ray Disc player, and the Wii focused on integrating controllers with movement sensors as well as joysticks.[1] Some Wii controllers could be moved about to control in-game actions, which enabled players to simulate real-world actions through movement during gameplay.By this generation, video game consoles had become an important part of the global IT infrastructure; it is estimated that video game consoles represented 25% of the world's general-purpose computational power in 2007.[2].Joining Nintendo in releasing motion devices and software, Sony Computer Entertainment released the PlayStation Move in September 2010, which featured motion-sensing gaming similar to that of the Wii.In November 2010, Microsoft released Kinect for use with the Xbox 360.Kinect did not use controllers, instead using cameras to capture the player's body motion and using that to direct gameplay, effectively making the players act as the \"controllers\".Having sold eight million units in its first 60 days on the market, Kinect claimed the Guinness World Record of being the \"fastest selling consumer electronics device\".[3][4].Among handheld consoles, the seventh generation began somewhat earlier than the home consoles.November 2004 saw the introduction of the Nintendo DS,[5] and the PlayStation Portable (PSP) came out in December.The DS features a touch screen and built-in microphone, and supports wireless standards.[6] The PSP became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format as its primary storage media.[7][8] Sony also gave the PSP multimedia capability;[9] connectivity with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, other PSPs; as well as Internet connectivity.[10][11] Despite high sales numbers for both consoles, PSP sales consistently lagged behind those of the DS.[12].", "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band": "Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles.Released on 26May 1967,[nb 1] Sgt.Pepper is regarded by musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the roles of sound composition, extended form, psychedelic imagery, record sleeves, and the producer in popular music.The album had an immediate cross-generational impact and was associated with numerous touchstones of the era's youth culture, such as fashion, drugs, mysticism, and a sense of optimism and empowerment.Critics lauded the album for its innovations in songwriting, production and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture..At the end of August 1966, the Beatles had permanently retired from touring and pursued individual interests for the next three months.During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the Sgt.Pepper concept.For this project, they continued the technological experimentation marked by their previous album, Revolver, this time without an absolute deadline for completion.Sessions began on 24November at EMI Studios with compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, but after pressure from EMI, the songs \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\" were released as a double A-side single in February 1967 and left off the LP.The album was then loosely conceptualised as a performance by the fictional Sgt.", "Temporal lobe": "The temporal lobe is one of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex in the brain of mammals.The temporal lobe is located beneath the lateral fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain.[3].The temporal lobe is involved in processing sensory input into derived meanings for the appropriate retention of visual memory, language comprehension, and emotion association.[4]:\u200a21.Temporal refers to the head's temples..The temporal lobe consists of structures that are vital for declarative or long-term memory.Declarative (denotative) or explicit memory is conscious memory divided into semantic memory (facts) and episodic memory (events).[4]:\u200a194\u200a Medial temporal lobe structures that are critical for long-term memory include the hippocampus, along with the surrounding hippocampal region consisting of the perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal neocortical regions.[4]:\u200a196\u200a The hippocampus is critical for memory formation, and the surrounding medial temporal cortex is currently theorized to be critical for memory storage.[4]:\u200a21\u200a The prefrontal and visual cortices are also involved in explicit memory.[4]:\u200a21.Research has shown that lesions in the hippocampus of monkeys results in limited impairment of function, whereas extensive lesions that include the hippocampus and the medial temporal cortex result in severe impairment.[5].The temporal lobe communicates with the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of explicit long-term memory modulated by the amygdala.[4]:\u200a349.The temporal lobe holds the primary auditory cortex, which is important for the processing of semantics in both language and vision in humans.Wernicke's area, which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes, plays a key role (in tandem with Broca's area in the frontal lobe) in language comprehension,[7] whether spoken language or signed language.FMRI imaging shows these portions of the brain are activated by signed or spoken languages.[8][9] These areas of the brain are active in children's language acquisition[10] whether accessed via hearing a spoken language, watching a signed language, or via hand-over-hand tactile versions of a signed language[11].The functions of the left temporal lobe are not limited to low-level perception but extend to comprehension, naming, and verbal memory.[12].", "Human lung": "The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most other animals, including some snails and a small number of fish.In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart.Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange.The pleurae, which are thin, smooth, and moist, serve to reduce friction between the lungs and chest wall during breathing, allowing for easy and effortless movements of the lungs..Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species.Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing.In earlier tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians.In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm.The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible..Humans have two lungs, one on the left and one on the right.They are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest.The right lung is bigger and heavier than the left, which shares space in the chest with the heart.", "Margarita": "A margarita is a cocktail consisting of tequila, triple sec, and lime juice.Some margarita recipes include simple syrup as well and are often served with salt on the rim of the glass.Margaritas can be served either shaken with ice (on the rocks), without ice (straight up), or blended with ice (frozen margarita).Most bars serve margaritas in a stepped-diameter variant of a cocktail glass or champagne coupe called a margarita glass.The margarita is one of the world's most popular cocktails and the most popular tequila-based cocktail.[1].The history of the margarita is shrouded in mystery and folklore due to its numerous origin stories.[2][3] According to cocktail historian David Wondrich, the margarita is related to the brandy daisy (margarita is Spanish for \"daisy\"), remade with tequila instead of brandy.(Daisies are a family of cocktails that include a base spirit, liqueur, and citrus.A sidecar and gin daisy are other related drinks.) There is an account from 1936 of Iowa newspaper editor James Graham finding such a cocktail in Tijuana, years before any of the other margarita \"creation myths\".[4].The Cafe Royal Cocktail Book, published in the UK in 1937, contains a recipe for a Picador using the same concentrations of tequila, triple sec, and lime juice as a margarita.[5] One of the earliest stories is of the margarita being invented in 1938 by Carlos \"Danny\" Herrera at his restaurant Rancho La Gloria, halfway between Tijuana and Rosarito, Baja California, created for customer and former Ziegfeld dancer Marjorie King, who was allergic to many spirits, but not to tequila.[6][7][3] This story was related by Herrera and also by bartender Albert Hernandez, acknowledged for popularizing a margarita in San Diego after 1947, at the La Plaza restaurant in La Jolla.[8] The story was debunked in 1992 by the San Diego Reader.[2].According to Jose Cuervo, the cocktail was invented in 1938 by a bartender in honor of Mexican showgirl Rita de la Rosa.[9].Hussong's Cantina also claims to have been the site of the margarita's creation in Ensenada, Baja California, in 1941.[10] Bartender Don Carlos Orozco reputedly named a new drink after Mexican-German patron Margarita Henkel Cesena, a frequent customer to the cantina.[2] Cesena was a ranch operator by trade, and it is disputed whether she was the daughter of a German ambassador as the story claims.[11][12] Hussong's, however, has enjoyed widespread popularity as the home of the original margarita.[13][14].There are also claims that the margarita was first mixed in Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua at Tommy's Place Bar on July 4, 1942, by Francisco \"Pancho\" Morales.", "Burgundy (color)": "Burgundy is a dark red-purplish color.[4][5].The color burgundy takes its name from the Burgundy wine  in France.When referring to the color, \"burgundy\" is not usually capitalized.[6].The color burgundy is similar to Bordeaux (Web color code #4C1C24), Merlot (#73343A), Berry (#A01641), and Redberry (#701f28).Burgundy is made of 50% red, 0% green, and 13% blue.The CMYK percentages are 0% cyan, 100% magenta, 75% yellow, 50% black.[7][8][9].The first recorded use of \"burgundy\" as a color name in English was in 1881.[10].In cosmetology, a brighter tone of burgundy called vivid burgundy is used for coloring hair.[12].The color old burgundy is a dark tone of burgundy..The first recorded use of old burgundy as a color name in English was in 1926.[14][15].Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate.HelpLearn to editCommunity

reported missing during wartime or ceasefire.They may have been killed, wounded, captured, executed, or deserted.If deceased, neither their remains nor grave have been positively identified.Becoming MIA has been an occupational risk for as long as there has been warfare..Until around 1912, service personnel in most countries were not routinely issued with ID tags.As a result, if someone was killed in action and their body was not recovered until much later, there was often little or no chance of identifying the remains unless the person in question was carrying items that would identify them, or had marked their clothing or possessions with identifying information.Starting around the time of the First World War, nations began to issue their service personnel with purpose-made identification tags.These were usually made of some form of lightweight metal such as aluminium.However, in the case of the British Army the material chosen was compressed fiber, which was not very durable.Although wearing identification tags proved to be highly beneficial, the problem remained that bodies could be completely destroyed (ranging from total body disruption to outright disintegration), burned or buried by the type of high-explosive munitions routinely used in modern warfare or in destructions of vehicles..Additionally, the combat environment itself could increase the likelihood of missing combatants such as jungle warfare,[1][2] or submarine warfare,[3][4][5] or aircraft crashes in remote mountainous terrain,[6] or at sea.Alternatively, there could be administrative errors; the actual location of a temporary battlefield grave could be misidentified or forgotten due to the \"fog of war\".[7] Finally, since military forces had no strong incentive to keep detailed records of enemy dead, bodies were frequently buried (sometimes with their identification tags) in temporary graves, the locations of which were often lost[8][9] or obliterated e.g.", "Center, Texas": "Center is a city in Shelby County, Texas, United States.The population was 5,221 at the 2020 U.S.census.It is the county seat of Shelby County located in deep East Texas.[4]  It was named for its location near the center of Shelby County; the community is near the Louisiana border..Center is 17 miles (27km) from the Louisiana border and 118 miles (190km) north of Beaumont at the center of Shelby County..According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.2 square miles (16km2), of which 6.2 square miles (16km2) is land and 0.16% is water..As of the 2020 United States census, there were 5,221 people, 1,713 households, and 1,266 families residing in the city..As of the census[2] of 2000, there were 5,678 people, 2,034 households, and 1,334 families residing in the city.The population density was 911.0 inhabitants per square mile (351.7/km2).There were 2,290 housing units at an average density of 367.4 per square mile (141.9/km2).The racial makeup of the city was 51.14% White, 34.22% African American, 0.23% Native American, 0.46% Asian, 10.95% from other races, and 2.99% from two or more races.Hispanic or Latino of any race were 18.05% of the population..", "Red-eye effect": "The red-eye effect in photography is the common appearance of red pupils in color photographs of the eyes of humans and several other animals.It occurs when using a photographic flash that is very close to the camera lens (as with most compact cameras) in ambient low light..In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close, so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil, reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil.The camera records this reflected light.The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is behind the retina.[1] The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid, and plays virtually no role.The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region, and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect.[2] The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light, below 430nm (depending on age), and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500nm, but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea.Melanin, located in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choroid, shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths.But blood is the main determinant of the red color, because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600nm.The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina.This amount varies strongly between individuals.Light-skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red-eye effect than dark-skinned people with brown eyes..The same holds for animals.", "University of California, Santa Barbara": "The University of California, Santa Barbara (UC Santa Barbara or UCSB), is a public land-grant research university in Santa Barbara, California, United States.[11] It is part of the University of California university system.[12] Tracing its roots back to 1891 as an independent teachers' college, UCSB joined the ancestor of the California State University system in the 1920s and then moved over to the University of California system in 1944.It is the third-oldest undergraduate campus in the system, after UC Berkeley and UCLA.Total student enrollment for 2022 was 23,460 undergraduate and 2,961 graduate students.[13].UCSB's campus is on an ocean-front, converted WWII-era Marine Corps air station.[14] UC Santa Barbara is organized into three undergraduate colleges (Letters and Science, Engineering, Creative Studies) and two graduate schools (Education and Environmental Science & Management), offering more than 200 degrees and programs.UCSB is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\" and is regarded as a Public Ivy.[15] The university has 10 national research centers,[16] including the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics.[17] According to the National Science Foundation, UC Santa Barbara spent $235 million on research and development in fiscal year 2018, ranking it 100th in the nation.[18] UCSB was the No.3 host on the ARPAnet and was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1995..Current UCSB faculty includes 6 Nobel Prize laureates, 1 Fields Medalist, 39 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 27 members of the National Academy of Engineering, and 34 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[19] The faculty also includes two Academy and Emmy Award winners and recipients of a Millennium Technology Prize, an IEEE Medal of Honor, a National Medal of Technology and Innovation and a Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics..UCSB traces its origins back to the Anna Blake School, which was founded in 1891, and offered training in home economics and industrial arts.[20][21] The Anna Blake School was taken over by the state in 1909 and became the Santa Barbara State Normal School, which then became the Santa Barbara State College in 1921.[22].In 1944, intense lobbying by an interest group in the City of Santa Barbara led by Thomas Storke and Pearl Chase persuaded the State Legislature, Gov.Earl Warren, and the Regents of the University of California to move the State College over to the more research-oriented University of California system.The State College system sued to stop the takeover, but the governor did not support the suit.A state constitutional amendment was passed in 1946 to stop subsequent conversions of State Colleges to University of California campuses.[23][24].", "Saint Joseph's Day": "Saint Joseph's Day, also called the Feast of Saint Joseph or the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, is in Western Christianity the principal feast day of Saint Joseph, husband of the Virgin Mary and legal father of Jesus Christ, celebrated on 19 March.It has the rank of a solemnity in the Catholic Church.It is a feast or commemoration in the provinces of the Anglican Communion,[1] and a feast or festival in the Lutheran Church.Saint Joseph's Day is the Patronal Feast day for Poland as well as for Canada, persons named Joseph, Josephine, etc., for religious institutes, schools and parishes bearing his name, and for carpenters.It is also Father's Day in some Catholic countries, mainly Spain, Portugal, and Italy.It is not a holy day of obligation for Catholics in the United States..19 March was dedicated to Saint Joseph in several Western calendars by the 10th century, and this custom was established in Rome by 1479.Pope Pius V extended its use to the entire Roman Rite by his Apostolic Constitution Quo primum (14 July 1570).Originally a double of the second class and a feast of precept, it was re-raised to be of precept in 1917 after having this status intermittently lost, and consequently also raised to its current rank of double of the first class (now called a solemnity), having become in the meantime the rank common to all remaining general feasts of precept.Since 1969, Episcopal Conferences may, if they wish, transfer it to a date outside Lent.Even if it occurs inside Lent on the usual date of 19 March, it is still observed as a Solemnity of a Saint\u2014this is one of the few times during Lent the Gloria may be said or sung, the vesture is changed from the purple or violet of Lent to white or gold (as it would be for such a solemnity normally), the Collect and the Eucharistic Prayer's Preface and other prayers are from the Solemnity and not Lent, the hymns are more joyful, and the Creed is said.However, the Alleluia is still not used, the Tract being used instead, per Lenten regulations.[2].", "Bumblebee": "A bumblebee (or bumble bee, bumble-bee, or humble-bee) is any of over 250 species in the genus Bombus, part of Apidae, one of the bee families.This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini, though a few extinct related genera (e.g., Calyptapis) are known from fossils.They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are also found in South America, where a few lowland tropical species have been identified.European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania.Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals..Most bumblebees are social insects that form colonies with a single queen.The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest.Cuckoo bumblebees are brood parasitic and do not make nests or form colonies; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers.Cuckoo bumblebees were previously classified as a separate genus, but are now usually treated as members of Bombus..Bumblebees have round bodies covered in soft hair (long branched setae) called 'pile', making them appear and feel fuzzy.They have aposematic (warning) coloration, often consisting of contrasting bands of colour, and different species of bumblebee in a region often resemble each other in mutually protective M\u00fcllerian mimicry.Harmless insects such as hoverflies often derive protection from resembling bumblebees, in Batesian mimicry, and may be confused with them.", "Open carry in the United States": "In the United States, open carry refers to the practice of visibly carrying a firearm in public places, as distinguished from concealed carry, where firearms cannot be seen by the casual observer.To \"carry\" in this context indicates that the firearm is kept readily accessible on the person, within a holster or attached to a sling.Carrying a firearm directly in the hands, particularly in a firing position or combat stance, is known as \"brandishing\" and may constitute a serious crime, but is not the mode of \"carrying\" discussed in this article..The practice of open carry, where gun owners openly carry firearms while they go about their daily business, has seen an increase in the United States in recent years,[1][2] and is a hotly debated topic in gun politics.This has been marked by a number of organized events intended to increase the visibility of open carry and public awareness about the practice.[3] Proponents of open carry point to history and statistics, noting that criminals usually conceal their weapons, in contrast to the law-abiding citizens who display their weapons.[4] As of 2022, almost all US states allow for open carry either without a permit or with a permit/license..The gun rights community has become supportive of the practice, while gun control groups are generally opposed.[5][6][7].Today in the United States, the laws vary from state to state regarding open carry of firearms.The categories are defined as follows:.In the United States, the laws concerning open carry vary by state and sometimes by municipality.The following chart lists state policies for openly carrying a loaded handgun in public..Open carry is generally prohibited with certain exceptions, such as when one is at home, their place of work, hunting, fishing, camping, or while practice shooting and while traveling to and from those activities..Open carry is allowed only with a Permit to Carry a Handgun.", "Color motion picture film": "Color motion picture film refers both to unexposed color photographic film in a format suitable for use in a motion picture camera, and to finished motion picture film, ready for use in a projector, which bears images in color..The first color cinematography was by additive color systems such as the one patented by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899 and tested in 1902.[1] A simplified additive system was successfully commercialized in 1909 as Kinemacolor.These early systems used black-and-white film to photograph and project two or more component images through different color filters..During 1930s the first practical subtractive color processes were introduced.These also used black-and-white film to photograph multiple color-filtered source images, but the final product was a multicolored print that did not require special projection equipment.Before 1932, when three-strip Technicolor was introduced, commercialized subtractive processes used only two color components and could reproduce only a limited range of color..In 1935, Kodachrome was introduced, followed by Agfacolor in 1936.They were intended primarily for amateur home movies and \"slides\".These were the first films of the \"integral tripack\" type, coated with three layers of different color-sensitive emulsion, which is usually what is meant by the words \"color film\" as commonly used.The few color photographic films still being made in the 2020s are of this type.The first color negative films and corresponding print films were modified versions of these films.They were introduced around 1940 but only came into wide use for commercial motion picture production in the early 1950s.", "Ashanti (entertainer)": "Ashanti Shequoiya Douglas (born October 13, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter and actress.She was first discovered as a teenager and later signed to Murder Inc.Records in 2002.[4] That year, she was featured on Fat Joe's \"What's Luv?\" and Ja Rule's \"Always on Time\", both of which became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002.She became the first woman artist to occupy the top two positions on the U.S.Billboard Hot 100 chart simultaneously with \"Foolish\" and \"What's Luv?\" at numbers one and two, respectively..In 2002, Ashanti released her eponymous debut album, which sold over 505,000 copies throughout the U.S.in its first week of release.The album earned her many awards, including eight Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, and a Grammy Award in 2003 for Best Contemporary R&B Album.The album has since been certified triple platinum in the United States and sold six million copies worldwide by the end of 2003.[5] The lead single for the album, \"Foolish\", was a critical and commercial success; it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.With \"Foolish\", she became the second artist (after The Beatles) to have their first three chart entries in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously.Ashanti wrote and provided background vocals for Jennifer Lopez's \"Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)\", which also reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[6].In 2003, Ashanti released her second album, Chapter II, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 326,000 copies in the U.S.", "United States Army Air Forces": "The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF or AAF)[1] was the major land-based aerial warfare service component of the United States Army and de facto aerial warfare service branch of the United States[2] during and immediately after World War II (1941\u20131947).It was created on 20 June 1941 as successor to the previous United States Army Air Corps and is the direct predecessor of the United States Air Force, today one of the six armed forces of the United States.The AAF was a component of the United States Army, which on 2 March 1942[1] was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces: the Army Ground Forces, the United States Army Services of Supply (which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces), and the Army Air Forces.Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff..The AAF administered all parts of military aviation formerly distributed among the Air Corps, General Headquarters Air Force, and the ground forces' corps area commanders and thus became the first air organization of the U.S.Army to control its own installations and support personnel.The peak size of the AAF during World War II was over 2.4million men and women in service and nearly 80,000 aircraft by 1944, and 783 domestic bases in December 1943.[3] By \"V-E Day\", the Army Air Forces had 1.25million men stationed overseas and operated from more than 1,600 airfields worldwide.[4].The Army Air Forces was created in June 1941 to provide the air arm greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently, to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force, and to end an increasingly divisive administrative battle within the Army over control of aviation doctrine and organization that had been ongoing since the creation of an aviation section within the U.S.Army Signal Corps in 1914.The AAF succeeded both the Air Corps, which had been the statutory military aviation branch since 1926 and the GHQ Air Force, which had been activated in 1935 to quiet the demands of airmen for an independent Air Force similar to the Royal Air Force which had already been established in the United Kingdom..Although other nations already had separate air forces independent of their army or navy (such as the Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe), the AAF remained a part of the Army until a defense reorganization in the post-war period resulted in the passage by the United States Congress of the National Security Act of 1947 with the creation of an independent United States Air Force in September 1947..In its expansion and conduct of the war, the AAF became more than just an arm of the greater organization.", "Freedom of Information Act (United States)": "The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA /\u02c8f\u0254\u026aj\u0259/ FOY-y\u0259), 5U.S.C.\u00a7552, is the United States federal freedom of information law that requires the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased or uncirculated information and documents controlled by the U.S.government, state, or other public authority upon request.The act defines agency records subject to disclosure, outlines mandatory disclosure procedures, and includes nine exemptions that define categories of information not subject to disclosure.[1][2] The act was intended to make U.S.government agencies' functions more transparent so that the American public could more easily identify problems in government functioning and put pressure on Congress, agency officials, and the president to address them.[3] The FOIA has been changed repeatedly by both the legislative and executive branches..The FOIA is commonly known for being invoked by news organizations for reporting purposes, though such uses make up less than 10% of all requests\u2014which are more frequently made by businesses, law firms, and individuals.[4].As indicated by its long title, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was moved from its original home in Section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).Section 3 of the APA, as enacted in 1946, gave agencies broad discretion concerning the publication of governmental records.Following concerns that the provision had become more of a withholding than a disclosure mechanism, Congress amended the section in 1966 as a standalone act to implement \"a general philosophy of full agency disclosure.\" The amendment required agencies to publish their rules of procedure in the Federal Register, 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(1)(C), and to make available for public inspection and copying their opinions, statements of policy, interpretations, and staff manuals and instructions that are not already published in the Federal Register, \u00a7 552(a)(2).In addition, \u00a7 552(a)(3) requires every agency, \"upon any request for records which ...reasonably describes such records\" to make such records \"promptly available to any person.\"  By \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) if an agency improperly withholds any documents, the district court has jurisdiction to order their production.Unlike the review of other agency action that must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary or capricious, FOIA expressly places the burden \"on the agency to sustain its action,\" and directs the district courts to \"determine the matter de novo.\".", "European Union": "in Europe(dark grey).The European Union (EU) is a supranational political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe.[7][8] The union has a total area of 4,233,255km2 (1,634,469sqmi) and an estimated total population of over 448million.The EU has often been described as a sui generis political entity (without precedent or comparison) combining the characteristics of both a federation and a confederation.[9][10].Containing 5.8% of the world population in 2020,[c] the EU generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around US$16.6trillion in 2022, constituting approximately one sixth of global nominal GDP and the third-biggest global economy after the United States and China.[12] Additionally, all EU states except Bulgaria have a very high Human Development Index according to the United Nations Development Programme.Its cornerstone, the Customs Union, paved the way to establishing an internal single market based on standardised legal framework and legislation that applies in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where the states have agreed to act as one.EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market;[13] enact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain common policies on trade,[14] agriculture,[15] fisheries and regional development.[16] Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area.[17] The eurozone is a group composed of the 20 EU member states that have fully implemented the economic and monetary union and use the euro currency.Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the union has developed a role in external relations and defence.It maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20.Due to its global influence, the European Union has been described by some scholars as an emerging superpower.[18][19][20].The union was established along with its citizenship when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993, and was subsequently incorporated as an international legal juridical person upon entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009,[21] but its beginnings may be traced to its earliest predecessors incorporated primarily by a group of founding states known as the Inner Six (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany) at the start of modern institutionalised European integration in 1948 and onwards, namely to the Western Union (WU, 1954 renamed Western European Union, WEU), the International Authority for the Ruhr (IAR), the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European Economic Community (EEC, 1993 renamed European Community, EC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), established, respectively, by the 1948 Treaty of Brussels, the 1948 London Six-Power Conference, the 1951 Treaty of Paris, the 1957 Treaty of Rome and the 1957 Euratom Treaty.These increasingly amalgamated bodies, later known collectively as the European Communities have grown since, along with their legal successor, the EU, both in size through accessions of further 21 states as well as in power through acquisitions of various policy areas to their remit by the virtue of the abovementioned treaties, as well as numerous other ones, such as the Modified Brussels Treaty, the Merger Treaty, the Single European Act, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice.In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[22].", "Wales national rugby league team": "The Wales national rugby league team (Welsh: t\u00eem rygbi'r gynghrair cenedlaethol Cymru) represents Wales in representative rugby league football matches.Currently the team is ranked 17th in the IRL World Rankings.The team was run under the auspices of the Rugby Football League, but an independent body, Wales Rugby League, now runs the team from Cardiff.Six Welsh players have been entered into the Rugby League Hall Of Fame..As with other Welsh national sporting teams, Wales strip has been primarily red.However, in the World Cup campaign in 2000 they wore a shirt featuring the Welsh flag, adding a touch of green and white.The team is known as \"The Dragons\" and so the team's logo on the shirt is a red dragon..The team date back to 1907, making them the third oldest national side after England and New Zealand, and it was a touring New Zealand side that Wales first played against in 1908, winning 9\u20138 at Aberdare.Since then, Wales have regularly played England, since 1935 France, as well as welcomed the touring Australia and New Zealand teams, although they rarely toured themselves, not playing a match in the Southern Hemisphere until 1975.For 26 years Wales competed against their two biggest rivals, England and France, in the European Nations Cup, winning the trophy four times..Wales has also competed in the World Cup on five occasions, the first time being in 1975.In 1995 and 2000 they had their most successful tournaments to date, making the Semi-Finals on both occasions before being beaten by England and Australia respectively.", "Cardiomyopathy": "Cardiomyopathy is a group of primary diseases of the heart muscle.[1] Early on there may be few or no symptoms.[1] As the disease worsens, shortness of breath, feeling tired, and swelling of the legs may occur, due to the onset of heart failure.[1] An irregular heart beat and fainting may occur.[1] Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.[2].As of 2013, cardiomyopathies are defined as \u201cdisorders characterized by morphologically and functionally abnormal myocardium in the absence of any other disease that is sufficient, by itself, to cause the observed phenotype.\u201d[8][9] Types of cardiomyopathy include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome).[3] In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the heart muscle enlarges and thickens.[3] In dilated cardiomyopathy the ventricles enlarge and weaken.[3] In restrictive cardiomyopathy the ventricle stiffens.[3].In many cases, the cause cannot be determined.[4] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually inherited, whereas dilated cardiomyopathy is inherited in about one third of cases.[4] Dilated cardiomyopathy may also result from alcohol, heavy metals, coronary artery disease, cocaine use, and viral infections.[4] Restrictive cardiomyopathy may be caused by amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and some cancer treatments.[4] Broken heart syndrome is caused by extreme emotional or physical stress.[3].Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and the severity of symptoms.[5] Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery.[5] Surgery may include a ventricular assist device or heart transplant.[5] In 2015 cardiomyopathy and myocarditis affected 2.5 million people.[6] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affects about 1 in 500 people while dilated cardiomyopathy affects 1 in 2,500.[3][10] They resulted in 354,000 deaths up from 294,000 in 1990.[7][11] Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is more common in young people.[2].Signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy include:.Cardiomyopathies can be of genetic (familial) or non-genetic (acquired) origin.[12] Genetic cardiomyopathies usually are caused by sarcomere or cytoskeletal diseases, neuromuscular disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, malformation syndromes and sometimes are unidentified.[13][14] Non-genetic cardiomyopathies can have a definitive causes such as viral infections, myocarditis and others.[15][16].Cardiomyopathies are either confined to the heart or are part of a generalized systemic disorder, both often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability.Other diseases that cause heart muscle dysfunction are excluded, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, or abnormalities of the heart valves.[17] Often, the underlying cause remains unknown, but in many cases the cause may be identifiable.[18] Alcoholism, for example, has been identified as a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, as has drug toxicity, and certain infections (including Hepatitis C).[19][20][21] Untreated celiac disease can cause cardiomyopathies, which can completely reverse with a timely diagnosis.[22] In addition to acquired causes, molecular biology and genetics have given rise to the recognition of various genetic causes.[20][23].A more clinical categorization of cardiomyopathy as 'hypertrophied', 'dilated', or 'restrictive',[24] has become difficult to maintain because some of the conditions could fulfill more than one of those three categories at any particular stage of their development.[25].The current American Heart Association (AHA) definition divides cardiomyopathies into primary, which affect the heart alone, and secondary, which are the result of illness affecting other parts of the body.These categories are further broken down into subgroups which incorporate new genetic and molecular biology knowledge.[26].The pathophysiology of cardiomyopathies is better understood at the cellular level with advances in molecular techniques.", "Fuck": "Fuck is an English-language profanity which often refers to the act of sexual intercourse, but is also commonly used as an intensifier or to convey disdain.While its origin is obscure, it is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475CE.[1] In modern usage, the term fuck and its derivatives (such as fucker and fucking) are used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, an interjection or an adverb.There are many common phrases that employ the word as well as compounds that incorporate it, such as motherfucker, fuckwit, fuckup, fucknut, fucktard, and fuck off..It is unclear whether the word has always been considered a pejorative or, if not, when it first came to be used to describe (often in an extremely angry, hostile or belligerent manner) unpleasant circumstances or people in an intentionally offensive way, such as in the term motherfucker, one of its more common usages in some parts of the English-speaking world.Some English-speaking countries censor it on television and radio.Andrea Millwood Hargrave's 2000 study of the attitudes of the British public found that fuck was considered the third-most-severe profanity, and its derivative motherfucker second.Cunt was considered the most severe.[2].Nevertheless, the word has increasingly become less of a pejorative and more publicly acceptable, an example of the \"dysphemism treadmill\" or semantic drift known as melioration, wherein former pejoratives become inoffensive and commonplace.[3][4] Because of its increasing usage in the public forum, in 2005 the word was included for the first time as one of three vulgarities in The Canadian Press's Canadian Press Caps and Spelling guide.Journalists were advised to refrain from censoring the word but use it sparingly and only when its inclusion was essential to the story.[5] According to linguist Pamela Hobbs, \"notwithstanding its increasing public use, enduring cultural models that inform our beliefs about the nature of sexuality and sexual acts preserve its status as a vile utterance that continues to inspire moral outrage.\" Hobbs considers users rather than usage of the word and sub-divides users into \"non-users\", for whom \"the word belongs to a set of taboo words, the very utterance of which constitutes an affront, and any use of the word, regardless of its form (verb, adjective, adverb, etc.) or meaning (literal or metaphorical) evokes the core sexual meanings and associated sexual imagery that motivate the taboo.\"; and \"users\", for whom \"metaphorical uses of the word fuck no more evoke images of sexual intercourse than a ten-year-old's 'My mom'll kill me if she finds out' evokes images of murder,\" so that the \"criteria of taboo are missing.\"[6].The Oxford English Dictionary states that the ultimate etymology is uncertain, but that the word is \"probably cognate\" with a number of Germanic words with meanings involving striking, rubbing and having sex or is derivative of the Old French word that meant 'to have sex'.[7].The word has probable cognates in other Germanic languages, such as German ficken ('to fuck'); Dutch fokken ('to breed', 'to beget'); Afrikaans fok ('to fuck');[8] Icelandic fokka ('to mess around', 'to rush');[9] dialectal Norwegian fukka ('to copulate'); and dialectal Swedish focka ('to strike', 'to copulate') and fock ('penis').[7] This points to a possible etymology where Common Germanic *fuk(k)\u014dn-from the verbal root *fug- ('to blow')[9] comes from an Indo-European root *peuk-, or *peu\u011d- ('to strike'),[10] cognate with non-Germanic words such as Latin pugno ('I fight') or pugnus ('fist').[7] By application of Grimm's law, this hypothetical root also has the Pre-Germanic form *pug-n\u00e9h2- (''to blow'),[9] which is the etymon of, amongst others, Dutch fok(zeil) ('foresail').[11] There is a theory that fuck is most likely derived from German or Dutch roots, and is probably not derived from an Old English root.[12].One reason that the word fuck is difficult to trace etymologically is that it was used far more extensively in common speech, rather than in easily traceable documents or writings.", "Passenger vehicles in the United States": "Since 2009, the United States is home to the second largest passenger vehicle market of any country in the world, second to China.[1] Overall, there were an estimated 263.6million registered vehicles in the United States in 2015, most of which were passenger vehicles.[2] This number, along with the average age of vehicles, has increased steadily since 1960.The United States is also home to three large vehicle manufacturers: General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler, which have historically been referred to as the \"Big Three\"..Cars became popular in the U.S.after the introduction of the Ford Model T in 1908, and experienced a further increase in popularity after the construction of the Interstate Highway System and the suburbanization of the United States in the 1950s.In the 21st century, large SUVs have become popular in the U.S., leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions[3] and pedestrian deaths.[4][5].The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration writes and enforces the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards..The United States is commonly regarded as a car-centric country, with cars being a dominant American mode of transport.U.S.infrastructure and road rules tend to privilege cars over other road users such as cyclists and pedestrians.Cars have been a major component of American culture, particularly since the 1950s.[6][7].The United States Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration as well as the National Automobile Dealers Association have published data in regard to the total number of vehicles, growth trends, and ratios between licensed drivers, the general population, and the increasing number of vehicles on American roads.Overall passenger vehicles have been outnumbering licensed drivers since 1972 at an ever-increasing rate, while light trucks and vehicles manufactured by foreign makes have gained a larger share of the automotive market in the United States.", "Medical laboratory": "A medical laboratory or clinical laboratory is a laboratory where tests are conducted out on clinical specimens to obtain information about the health of a patient to aid in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.[1] Clinical medical laboratories are an example of applied science, as opposed to research laboratories that focus on basic science, such as found in some academic institutions..Medical laboratories vary in size and complexity and so offer a variety of testing services.More comprehensive services can be found in acute-care hospitals and medical centers, where 70% of clinical decisions are based on laboratory testing.[2]  Doctors offices and clinics, as well as skilled nursing and long-term care facilities, may have laboratories that provide more basic testing services.Commercial medical laboratories operate as independent businesses and provide testing that is otherwise not provided in other settings due to low test volume or complexity.[3].In hospitals and other patient-care settings, laboratory medicine is provided by the Department of Pathology and Medical Laboratory, and generally divided into two sections, each of which will be subdivided into multiple specialty areas.[4] The two sections are:.Layouts of clinical laboratories in health institutions vary greatly from one facility to another.For instance, some health facilities have a single laboratory for the microbiology section, while others have a separate lab for each specialty area..The following is an example of a typical breakdown of the responsibilities of each area:.The staff of clinical laboratories may include:.The United States has a documented shortage of working laboratory professionals.For example, as of 2016[update] vacancy rates for Medical Laboratory Scientists ranged from 5% to 9% for various departments.The decline is primarily due to retirements, and to at-capacity educational programs that cannot expand which limits the number of new graduates.", "List of poker hands": "In poker, players form sets of five playing cards, called hands, according to the rules of the game.[1] Each hand has a rank, which is compared against the ranks of other hands participating in the showdown to decide who wins the pot.[2] In high games, like Texas hold 'em and seven-card stud, the highest-ranking hands win.In low games, like razz, the lowest-ranking hands win.In high-low split games, both the highest-ranking and lowest-ranking hands win, though different rules are used to rank the high and low hands.[3][4].Each hand belongs to a category determined by the patterns formed by its cards.A hand in a higher-ranking category always ranks higher than a hand in a lower-ranking category.A hand is ranked within its category using the ranks of its cards.Individual cards are ranked, from highest to lowest: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2.[5] However, aces have the highest rank under ace-to-five high or six-to-ace low rules, or under high rules as part of a five-high straight or straight flush.[6][7] Suits are not ranked, so hands that differ by suit alone are of equal rank.[8].There are nine categories of hand when using a standard 52-card deck, except under ace-to-five low rules where straights, flushes and straight flushes are not recognized.An additional category, five of a kind, exists when using one or more wild cards.The fewer hands a category contains, the higher its rank.[9] There are.52.!.", "Bruce Hornsby": "Bruce Randall Hornsby

domestic product (GDP), but it employs about 20% of the working population.About 30% of the country's land is used for crop cultivation.[1].Cuba's agricultural history can be divided into five periods, reflecting Cuban history in general:.During each of these periods, agriculture in Cuba has confronted unique obstacles..Before the 1959 Cuban Revolution, the agricultural sector in Cuba was largely oriented towards and dominated by the US economy.After the Revolution, the revolutionary government nationalised farmland, and the Soviet Union supported Cuban agriculture by paying premium prices for Cuba's main agricultural product, sugarcane, and by delivering fertilizers.Sugar was bought by the Soviets at more than five times the market price.95% of its citrus crop was exported to the Comecon countries.The Soviets provided Cuba with 63% of its food imports and 90% of its petrol.[2].After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Cuban agricultural sector faced a very difficult period.Cuba had to rely on sustainable farming methods.", "Mega Millions": "Mega Millions (originally known as The Big Game in 1996 and renamed, temporarily, to The Big Game Mega Millions

Allhalloween,[9] All Hallows' Eve,[10] or All Saints' Eve)[11] is a celebration observed in many countries  on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day.It is at the beginning of the observance of Allhallowtide,[12] the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed.[5][13][14][15] In popular culture, the day has become a celebration of horror, being associated with the macabre and supernatural.[16].One theory holds that many Halloween traditions were influenced by Celtic harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain, which are believed to have pagan roots.[17][18][19][20] Some go further and suggest that Samhain may have been Christianized as All Hallow's Day, along with its eve, by the early Church.[21] Other academics believe Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, being the vigil of All Hallow's Day.[22][23][24][25] Celebrated in Ireland and Scotland for centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants took many Halloween customs to North America in the 19th century,[26][27] and then through American influence various Halloween customs spread to other countries by the late 20th and early 21st century.[16][28].Popular Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the related guising and souling), attending Halloween costume parties, carving pumpkins or turnips into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, and watching horror or Halloween-themed films.[29] Some people practice the Christian observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead,[30][1][31] although it is a secular celebration for others.[32][2][33] Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows' Eve, a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day, including apples, potato pancakes, and soul cakes.[34][35][36][37].The word Halloween or Hallowe'en (\"Saints' evening\"[38]) is of Christian origin;[39][40] a term equivalent to \"All Hallows Eve\" is attested in Old English.[41] The word hallowe[']en comes from the Scottish form of All Hallows' Eve (the evening before All Hallows' Day):[42] even is the Scots term for \"eve\" or \"evening\",[43] and is contracted to e'en or een;[44] (All) Hallow(s) E(v)en became Hallowe'en..Halloween is thought to have influences from Christian beliefs and practices.[45][46] The English word 'Halloween' comes from \"All Hallows' Eve\", being the evening before the Christian holy days of All Hallows' Day (All Saints' Day) on 1 November and All Souls' Day on 2 November.[47] Since the time of the early Church,[48] major feasts in Christianity (such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost) had vigils that began the night before, as did the feast of All Hallows'.[49][45] These three days are collectively called Allhallowtide and are a time when Western Christians honour all saints and pray for recently departed souls who have yet to reach Heaven.Commemorations of all saints and martyrs were held by several churches on various dates, mostly in springtime.[50] In 4th-century Roman Edessa it was held on 13 May, and on 13 May 609, Pope Boniface IV re-dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to \"St Mary and all martyrs\".[51] This was the date of Lemuria, an ancient Roman festival of the dead.[52].In the 8th century, Pope Gregory III (731\u2013741) founded an oratory in St Peter's for the relics \"of the holy apostles and of all saints, martyrs and confessors\".[45][53] Some sources say it was dedicated on 1 November,[54] while others say it was on Palm Sunday in April 732.[55][56] By 800, there is evidence that churches in Ireland[57] and Northumbria were holding a feast commemorating all saints on 1 November.[58] Alcuin of Northumbria, a member of Charlemagne's court, may then have introduced this 1 November date in the Frankish Empire.[59] In 835, it became the official date in the Frankish Empire.[58] Some suggest this was due to Celtic influence, while others suggest it was a Germanic idea,[58] although it is claimed that both Germanic and Celtic-speaking peoples commemorated the dead at the beginning of winter.[60] They may have seen it as the most fitting time to do so, as it is a time of 'dying' in nature.[58][60] It is also suggested the change was made on the \"practical grounds that Rome in summer could not accommodate the great number of pilgrims who flocked to it\", and perhaps because of public health concerns over Roman Fever, which claimed a number of lives during Rome's sultry summers.[61][45].By the end of the 12th century, the celebration had become known as the holy days of obligation in Western Christianity and involved such traditions as ringing church bells for souls in purgatory.It was also \"customary for criers dressed in black to parade the streets, ringing a bell of mournful sound and calling on all good Christians to remember the poor souls\".[63] The Allhallowtide custom of baking and sharing soul cakes for all christened souls,[64] has been suggested as the origin of trick-or-treating.[65] The custom dates back at least as far as the 15th century[66] and was found in parts of England, Wales, Flanders, Bavaria and Austria.[67] Groups of poor people, often children, would go door-to-door during Allhallowtide, collecting soul cakes, in exchange for praying for the dead, especially the souls of the givers' friends and relatives.This was called \"souling\".[66][68][69] Soul cakes were also offered for the souls themselves to eat,[67] or the 'soulers' would act as their representatives.[70] As with the Lenten tradition of hot cross buns, soul cakes were often marked with a cross, indicating they were baked as alms.[71] Shakespeare mentions souling in his comedy The Two Gentlemen of Verona (1593).[72] While souling, Christians would carry \"lanterns made of hollowed-out turnips\", which could have originally represented souls of the dead;[73][74] jack-o'-lanterns were used to ward off evil spirits.[75][76] On All Saints' and All Souls' Day during the 19th century, candles were lit in homes in Ireland,[77] Flanders, Bavaria, and in Tyrol, where they were called \"soul lights\",[78] that served \"to guide the souls back to visit their earthly homes\".[79] In many of these places, candles were also lit at graves on All Souls' Day.[78] In Brittany, libations of milk were poured on the graves of kinfolk,[67] or food would be left overnight on the dinner table for the returning souls;[78] a custom also found in Tyrol and parts of Italy.[80][78].Christian minister Prince Sorie Conteh linked the wearing of costumes to the belief in vengeful ghosts: \"It was traditionally believed that the souls of the departed wandered the earth until All Saints' Day, and All Hallows' Eve provided one last chance for the dead to gain vengeance on their enemies before moving to the next world.", "Taxicabs of New York City": "In New York City, taxicabs come in two varieties: yellow and green; they are widely recognizable symbols of the city.Taxis painted yellow (medallion taxis) are able to pick up passengers anywhere in the five boroughs.Those painted apple green (street hail livery vehicles, commonly known as \"boro taxis\"), which began to appear in August 2013, are allowed to pick up passengers in Upper Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens (excluding LaGuardia Airport and John F.Kennedy International Airport), and Staten Island.Both types have the same fare structure.Taxicabs are operated by private companies and licensed by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).It also oversees over 40,000 other for-hire vehicles, including \"black cars\", commuter vans, and ambulettes..Taxicab vehicles, each of which must have a medallion to operate, are driven an average of 180 miles per shift.As of March14, 2014[update], there were 51,398 individuals licensed to drive medallion taxicabs.There were 13,605 taxicab medallion licenses in existence.By July 2016[update], that number had dropped slightly to 13,587 medallions, or 18 lower than the 2014 total.Taxi patronage has declined since 2011 due to competition from ridesharing companies..", "Xylem": "Xylem is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants, the other being phloem.The basic function of the xylem is to transport water from roots to stems and leaves, but it also transports nutrients.[1][2] The word xylem is derived from the Ancient Greek word \u03be\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd (xylon), meaning \"wood\"; the best-known xylem tissue is wood, though it is found throughout a plant.[3] The term was introduced by Carl N\u00e4geli in 1858.[4][5].The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water.Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.[6].Xylem also contains two other type of cells: parenchyma and fibers.[7].Xylem can be found:.In transitional stages of plants with secondary growth, the first two categories are not mutually exclusive, although usually a vascular bundle will contain primary xylem only..The branching pattern exhibited by xylem follows Murray's law.[8].Primary xylem is formed during primary growth from procambium.It includes protoxylem and metaxylem.Metaxylem develops after the protoxylem but before secondary xylem.Metaxylem has wider vessels and tracheids than protoxylem..", "Women's suffrage": "Women's suffrage is the right of women to vote in elections.In the beginning of the 18th century, some people sought to change voting laws to allow women to vote.Liberal political parties would go on to grant women the right to vote, increasing the number of those parties' potential constituencies.National and international organizations formed to coordinate efforts towards women voting, especially the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (founded in 1904 in Berlin, Germany).[1].Many instances occurred in recent centuries where women were selectively given, then stripped of, the right to vote.In Sweden, conditional women's suffrage was in effect during the Age of Liberty (1718\u20131772).[2].The first territory to continuously allow women to vote was Pitcairn Islands in 1838, and the first sovereign nation was Finland[citation needed] in 1906, as the Kingdom of Hawai'i, which originally had universal suffrage in 1840, rescinded this in 1852 and was subsequently annexed by the United States in 1898.In the years after 1869, a number of provinces held by the British and Russian empires conferred women's suffrage, and some of these became sovereign nations at a later point, like New Zealand, Australia, and Finland.Several states and territories of the United States, such as Wyoming (1869) and Utah (1870), also granted women the right to vote.Women who owned property gained the right to vote in the Isle of Man in 1881, and in 1893, women in the then self-governing[3] British colony of New Zealand were granted the right to vote.In Australia, the colony of South Australia conferred voter rights on all women from 1894, and the right to stand for Parliament from 1895, while the Australian Federal Parliament conferred the right to vote and stand for election in 1902 (although it allowed for the exclusion of \"aboriginal natives\").[4][5] Prior to independence, in the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland, women gained equal suffrage, with both the right to vote and to stand as candidates in 1906.[6][7][8] Most major Western powers extended voting rights to women in the interwar period, including Canada (1917), the United Kingdom and Germany (1918), Austria, the Netherlands (1919) and the United States (1920).Notable exceptions in Europe were France, where women could not vote until 1944, Greece (equal voting rights for women did not exist there until 1952, although, since 1930, literate women were able to vote in local elections), and Switzerland (where, since 1971, women could vote at the federal level, and between 1959 and 1990, women got the right to vote at the local canton level).", "The Thirteenth Tale": "The Thirteenth Tale (2006) by Diane Setterfield is a gothic suspense novel, the author's first published book..Vida Winter, a famous novelist in England, has evaded journalists' questions about her past, refusing to answer their inquiries and spinning elaborate tales that they later discover to be false.Her entire life is a secret: and, for over fifty years, reporters and biographers have tried innumerable methods in an attempt to extract the truth from Winter.With her health quickly fading, Winter enlists Margaret Lea, a bookish amateur biographer, to hear her story and write her biography.With her own family secrets, Lea finds the process of unraveling the past for Winter bringing her to confront her own ghosts..The novel opens as Lea returns to her apartment above her father's antiquarian bookshop and finds a hand-written letter from Winter.It requests her presence at the author's residence and offers the chance to write Winter's life story before she succumbs to a terminal illness.Lea is surprised by the proposal, as she is only vaguely aware of the famous author and has not read any of the dozens of novels penned by

woman.", "Jehovah's Witnesses": "Jehovah's Witnesses is a nontrinitarian millenarian restorationist Christian denomination.[6].As of 2022, the group reported approximately 8.5million members involved in evangelism, with 19.7million attending the annual Memorial of Christ's death.[5][en 1] The denomination is directed by a group of elders known as the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, which establishes all doctrines.[7][8] Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent, and the establishment of God's kingdom over earth is the only solution to all of humanity's problems.[9].The group emerged from the Bible Student movement founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell, who also co-founded Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881 to organize and print the movement's publications.[3] A leadership dispute after Russell's death resulted in several groups breaking away, with Joseph Franklin Rutherford retaining control of the Watch Tower Society and its properties.[10] Rutherford made significant organizational and doctrinal changes,[11] including adoption of the name Jehovah's witnesses[en 2] in 1931 to distinguish the group from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell's traditions.[13][14].Jehovah's Witnesses are known for their door-to-door preaching, distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake!, and for refusing military service and blood transfusions.They consider the use of God's name vital for proper worship.They reject Trinitarianism, inherent immortality of the soul, and hellfire, which they consider unscriptural doctrines.They do not observe Christmas, Easter, birthdays, or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity.[15] They prefer to use their own Bible translation, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.[16][17] Witnesses commonly call their body of beliefs \"The Truth\" and consider themselves to be \"in the Truth\".[18] They consider human society morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan, and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses.[19].Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping, their term for formal expulsion and shunning, a last resort for what they consider serious offenses.[20][21] Baptized people who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned.Disfellowshipped and disassociated people may eventually be reinstated.[22] Former members can experience significant mental distress as a result of this ostracism,[23] and some seek reinstatement to keep contact with their friends and family.[22].The group's position on conscientious objection to military service and refusal to salute state symbols (like national anthems and flags) has brought it into conflict with some governments.[24] Some Jehovah's Witnesses have been persecuted, and their activities banned or restricted in some countries.Persistent legal challenges by Jehovah's Witnesses have influenced legislation related to civil rights in several countries.[25].The organization has been criticized regarding biblical translation, doctrines, and alleged coercion of its members.", "Last Tango in Paris": "Last Tango in Paris (Italian: Ultimo tango a Parigi; French: Le Dernier Tango \u00e0 Paris) is

manufacturing on August 24, 2001, and later to retail on October 25, 2001.It is a direct upgrade to its predecessors, Windows 2000 for high-end and business users and Windows Me for home users, and is available for any devices running Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 2000, or Windows Me that meet the new Windows XP system requirements..Development of Windows XP began in the late 1990s under the codename \"Neptune\", built on the Windows NT kernel and explicitly intended for mainstream consumer use.An updated version of Windows 2000 was also initially planned for the business market.However, in January 2000, both projects were scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed \"Whistler\", which would serve as a single platform for both consumer and business markets.As a result, Windows XP is the first consumer edition of Windows not based on the Windows 95 kernel or MS-DOS.Windows XP removed support for PC-98, i486 and SGI Visual Workstation 320 and 540 and will only run on 32-bit x86 CPUs and devices that use BIOS firmware..Upon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim, noting increased performance and stability (especially compared to Windows Me), a more intuitive user interface, improved hardware support, and expanded multimedia capabilities.Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were succeeded by Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, released in 2007 and 2008, respectively.However, some criticisms of Windows XP were its security issues at launch, and many people believed their anti-piracy schemes had gone too far..Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009, and extended support ended on April 8, 2014.", "Por una Cabeza": "\"Por una Cabeza\" (pronounced [\u02c8po\u027e \u02c8una ka\u02c8\u03b2esa]) is a tango song written in 1935 with music by Carlos Gardel and lyrics by Alfredo Le Pera.[1].The name is a Spanish horse-racing phrase meaning \"by a head\", which refers to a horse winning a race narrowly\u2013  by just the length of its head.The lyrics speak of a compulsive horse-track gambler who compares his addiction for horses with his attraction to women..Alfredo Le Pera was born in Brazil, son of Italian immigrants.Le Pera and Gardel died in an aeroplane crash in Medell\u00edn, on Monday, June 24, 1935.[2].\"Por Una Cabeza\" is featured in a famous tango scene in Martin Brest's film Scent of a Woman (1992), in the opening scene of Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993), and in James Cameron's True Lies (1994).[3][4].Por una cabeza.de un noble potrillo.que justo en la raya.afloja al llegar,.y que al regresar.parece decir:.", "Baroreflex": "The baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the body's homeostatic mechanisms that helps to maintain blood pressure at nearly constant levels.The baroreflex provides a rapid negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure causes the heart rate to decrease.Decreased blood pressure decreases baroreflex activation and causes heart rate to increase and to restore blood pressure levels.Their function is to sense pressure changes by responding to change in the tension of the arterial wall[1] The baroreflex can begin to act in less than the duration of a cardiac cycle (fractions of a second) and thus baroreflex adjustments are key factors in dealing with postural hypotension, the tendency for blood pressure to decrease on standing due to gravity..The system relies on specialized neurons, known as baroreceptors, chiefly in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses, to monitor changes in blood pressure and relay them to the medulla oblongata.Baroreceptors are stretch receptors and respond to the pressure induced stretching of the blood vessel in which they are found.Baroreflex-induced changes in blood pressure are mediated by both branches of the autonomic nervous system: the parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves.Baroreceptors are active even at normal blood pressures so their activity informs the brain about both increases and decreases in blood pressure..The body contains two other, slower-acting systems to regulate blood pressure: the heart releases atrial natriuretic peptide when blood pressure is too high, and the kidneys sense and correct low blood pressure with the renin\u2013angiotensin system.[2].Baroreceptors are present in the atria of the heart and vena cavae, but the most sensitive baroreceptors are in the carotid sinuses and aortic arch.While the carotid sinus baroreceptor axons travel within the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), the aortic arch baroreceptor axons travel within the vagus nerve (CN X).Baroreceptor activity travels along these nerves directly into the central nervous system to excite glutamatergic neurons within the solitary nucleus (SN) in the brainstem.[3] Baroreceptor information flows from these NSS neurons to both parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons within the brainstem.[citation needed].", "1989 Loma Prieta earthquake": "The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred on California's Central Coast on October 17 at 5:04 p.m.local time.The shock was centered in The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park in Santa Cruz County, approximately 10mi (16km) northeast of Santa Cruz on a section of the San Andreas Fault System and was named for the nearby Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains.With an Mw magnitude of 6.9[10] and a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent), the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries.The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (to the degree that it was designated a seismic gap) until two moderate foreshocks occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989..Damage was heavy in Santa Cruz County and less so to the south in Monterey County, but effects extended well to the north into the San Francisco Bay Area, both on the San Francisco Peninsula and across the bay in Oakland.No surface faulting occurred, though many other ground failures and landslides were present, especially in the Summit area of the Santa Cruz Mountains.Liquefaction was also a significant issue, especially in the heavily damaged Marina District of San Francisco, but its effects were also seen in the East Bay, and near the shore of Monterey Bay, where a non-destructive tsunami was also observed.[11].Because it happened during a national live broadcast of the 1989 World Series, the annual championship series of Major League Baseball, taking place between Bay Area teams San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics, it is sometimes referred to as the \"World Series earthquake\", with the championship games of the year being referred to as the \"Earthquake Series\".Rush-hour traffic on the Bay Area freeways was lighter than normal because the game, being played at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, was about to begin, and this may have prevented a larger loss of life, as several of the Bay Area's major transportation structures suffered catastrophic failures.The collapse of a section of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland was the site of the largest number of casualties for the event, but the collapse of man-made structures and other related accidents contributed to casualties occurring in San Francisco, Los Altos, and Santa Cruz..The history of earthquake investigations in California has been largely focused on the San Andreas Fault system because of its strong influence in the state as the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate; it is the most studied fault on Earth.", "Pawn (chess)": "The pawn (\u2659, \u265f) is the most numerous and weakest piece in the game of chess.It may move one vacant square directly forward, it may move two vacant squares directly forward on its first move, and it may capture one square diagonally forward.Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of their second rank.The white pawns start on a2 through h2; the black pawns start on a7 through h7..Individual pawns are referred to by the file on which they stand.For example, one speaks of \"White's f-pawn\" or \"Black's b-pawn\".Alternatively, they can be referred to by the piece which stood on that file at the beginning of the game, e.g.\"White's king bishop's pawn\" or \"Black's queen knight's pawn\".It is also common to refer to a rook's pawn, meaning any pawn on the a- or h-files, a knight's pawn (on the b- or g-files), a bishop's pawn (on the c- or f-files), a queen's pawn (on the d-file), a king's pawn (on the e-file), and a central pawn (on the d- or e-files)..The pawn historically represents soldiers or infantry, or more particularly, armed peasants or pikemen.[1].Each player begins the game with eight pawns placed along their second rank..A pawn may move by vertically advancing to a vacant square ahead.", "Sexual orientation and military service": "LGB service by country.Trans service by country.Intersex service by country.Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) personnel are able to serve in the armed forces of some countries around the world: the vast majority of industrialized, Western countries including some South American countries such as Argentina and Chile[1][2] in addition to South Africa, and Israel.[3] The rights concerning intersex people are more vague..This keeps pace with the latest global figures on acceptance of homosexuality, which suggest that acceptance of LGBTQ communities is becoming more widespread only in secular, affluent countries.[4].However, an accepting policy toward gay and lesbian soldiers does not invariably guarantee that LGBTQ citizens are immune to discrimination in that particular society.Even in countries where LGBTQ persons are free to serve in the military, activists lament that there remains room for improvement.Israel, for example, a country that otherwise struggles to implement LGBTQ-positive social policy, nevertheless has a military well known for its broad acceptance of openly gay soldiers.[5][6].History has seen societies that both embrace and shun openly gay service-members in the military.But more recently, the high-profile 2010 hearings on \"Don't ask, don't tell\" in the United States propelled the issue to the center of international attention.They also shed light both on the routine discrimination, violence, and hardship faced by LGBTQ-identified soldiers, as well as arguments for and against a ban on their service.[7].In ancient Greece, the Sacred Band of Thebes was a military unit from 378 BCE which consisted of male lovers who were known for their effectiveness in battle.[8] Same-sex love also occurred among the Samurai class in Japan, being practiced between an adult and a younger apprentice.[9].", "Hydrogen production": "Hydrogen production is the family of industrial methods for generating hydrogen gas..There are four main sources for the commercial production of hydrogen: natural gas, oil, coal, and electrolysis of water; which account for 48%, 30%, 18% and 4% of the world's hydrogen production respectively.[1] Fossil fuels are the dominant source of industrial hydrogen.[2] As of 2020, the majority of hydrogen (~95%) is produced by steam reforming of natural gas and other light hydrocarbons, partial oxidation of heavier hydrocarbons, and coal gasification.[3][4] Other methods of hydrogen production include biomass gasification and methane pyrolysis.Methane pyrolysis and water electrolysis can use any source of electricity including renewable energy..The production of hydrogen plays a key role in any industrialized society, since hydrogen is required for many chemical processes.[5] In 2020, roughly 87 million tons of hydrogen was produced[6] worldwide for various uses, such as oil refining, in the production of ammonia through the Haber process, and in the production of methanol through reduction of carbon monoxide.The global hydrogen generation market was valued at US$155 billion in 2022, and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.3% from 2023 to 2030.[7].Steam methane reforming (SMR) produces hydrogen from natural gas, mostly methane (CH4), and water.It is the cheapest source of industrial hydrogen, being the source of nearly 50% of the world's hydrogen.[8] The process consists of heating the gas to 700\u20131,100\u00b0C (1,300\u20132,000\u00b0F) in the presence of steam over a nickel catalyst.The resulting endothermic reaction  forms carbon monoxide and molecular hydrogen (H2).[9].In the water-gas shift reaction, the carbon monoxide reacts with steam  to obtain further quantities of H2.The WGSR also requires a catalyst, typically over iron oxide or other oxides.The byproduct is CO2.[9] Depending on the quality of the feedstock (natural gas, naphtha, etc.), one ton of hydrogen produced will also produce 9 to 12 tons of CO2, a greenhouse gas that may be captured.[10].For this process, high temperature steam (H2O) reacts with methane (CH4) in an endothermic reaction to yield syngas.[11].", "Basis point": "A basis point (often abbreviated as bp, often pronounced as \"bip\" or \"beep\"[1]) is one hundredth of 1 percentage point.The related term permyriad means one hundredth of 1 percent.Changes of interest rates are often stated in basis points.If an interest rate of 10% increased by 1 basis point, it changed to 10.01%.[2].Basis points are used as a convenient unit of measurement in contexts where percentage differences of less than 1% are discussed.The most common example is interest rates, where differences in interest rates of less than 1% per year are usually meaningful to talk about.For example, a difference of 0.10 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 basis points (e.g., a 4.67% rate increases by 10 basis points to 4.77%).In other words, an increase of 100 basis points means a rise by 1 percentage point..Like percentage points, basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate.For example,  if a report says there has been a \"1% increase\" from a 10% interest rate, this could refer to an increase either from 10% to 10.1% (relative, 1% of 10%), or from 10% to 11% (absolute, 1% plus 10%).However, if the report says there has been a \"100 basis point increase\" from a 10% interest rate, then the interest rate of 10% has increased by 1.00% (the absolute change) to an 11% rate..It is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument, or the difference (spread) between two interest rates, including the yields of fixed-income securities..", "British Royal Family": "The British royal family comprises King Charles III and his close relations.Charles is the head of the House of Windsor.There is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member, although the Royal Household has issued different lists outlining who is a part of the royal family.[1][2] Members often support the monarch in undertaking public engagements, and pursue charitable work and interests.The royal family are regarded as British and world cultural icons..The Lord Chamberlain's \"List of the Royal Family\" published in 2020 mentions all of King George VI's descendants and their spouses (including Sarah, Duchess of York, who is divorced), along with Queen Elizabeth II's cousins with royal rank and their spouses.[2] The Lord Chamberlain's list applies for the purposes of regulating the use of royal symbols and images of the family.[3] Meanwhile, the website of the royal family provides a list of \"Members of the Royal Family\"; those listed correspond to the royal family members mentioned and pictured below, with the exception of Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, the Duchess of Kent, and Prince Michael of Kent and his wife.[4].The

(/\u02c8he\u026ati/ \u24d8 HAY-tee; French: Ha\u00efti [a.iti]; Haitian Creole: Ayiti [ajiti]), officially the Republic of Haiti (French: R\u00e9publique d'Ha\u00efti; Haitian Creole: Repiblik d Ayiti),[14] and formerly known as Hayti,[b] is a country on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea, east of Cuba and Jamaica, and south of The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.It occupies the western three-eighths of the island which it shares with the Dominican Republic.[20][21] To its south-west lies the small Navassa Island, which is claimed by Haiti but is disputed as a United States territory under federal administration.[22][23] Haiti is 27,750km2 (10,714sqmi) in size, the third largest country in the Caribbean by area, and has an estimated population of 11.4 million,[24][25] making it the most populous country in the Caribbean.The capital is Port-au-Prince..The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people, who originated in South America.[26] The first Europeans arrived on 5 December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus.[27] Columbus subsequently founded the first European settlement in the Americas, La Navidad, on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti.[28][29][30][31] The island was claimed by Spain and named La Espa\u00f1ola, forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century.However, competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being ceded to France in 1697, which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue.French colonists established lucrative sugarcane plantations, worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa, which made the colony one of the richest in the world..In the midst of the French Revolution (1789\u201399), slaves, maroons, and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804), led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army, Toussaint Louverture.After 12 years of conflict, Napoleon Bonaparte's forces were defeated by Louverture's successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines (later Emperor Jacques I), who declared Haiti's sovereignty on 1 January 1804\u2014the first independent nation of Latin America and the Caribbean, the second republic in the Americas, the first country in the Americas to eliminate slavery, and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt.[32][33] Apart from Alexandre P\u00e9tion, the first President of the Republic, all of Haiti's first leaders were former slaves.[34] After a brief period in which the country was split in two, President Jean-Pierre Boyer united the country and then attempted to expand Haitian influence over the eastern part of Hispaniola, which eventually led to the Haitian\u2013Dominican Wars.Haiti recognized Dominican independence in 1867, following their declaration in 1844..Haiti's first century of independence was characterized by political instability, ostracism by the international community, and the payment of a crippling debt to France.Political volatility and foreign economic influence in the country prompted the United States to occupy the country from 1915 to 1934.Following a series of short-lived presidencies, Fran\u00e7ois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier took power in 1957, ushering in a long period of autocratic rule continued by his son, Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier, that lasted until 1986; the period was characterized by state-sanctioned violence against the opposition and civilians, corruption, and economic stagnation.", "The Bloody Beetroots": "The Bloody Beetroots is an Italian electronic music project of musician and producer Bob Rifo (also Sir Bob Cornelius Rifo and SBCR, born Simone Cogo).Established in late 2006, the Bloody Beetroots were initially a duo consisting of Bob Rifo and Tommy Tea, who later left in 2012.[1].The leader of the band, Sir Bob Cornelius Rifo, was born in 1977 in Bassano del Grappa, Italy.He lives in Venice Beach, California.He is a classically trained musician, but gained reputation for producing music with styles ranging from punk rock to the new wave of the 1980s.His identity remains largely anonymous.In fact, the only identifying public feature he has is the year \"1977\" tattooed across his chest, which is the year of his birth, that coincided with the year punk-rock was born.Rifo, a music producer, DJ and photographer uses the pseudonym the Bloody Beetroots himself.[2].Sir Bob Cornelius Rifo gained the support of Etienne De Crecy, Alex Gopher, and Dim Mak's Steve Aoki[3] with his early singles \"Warp 1.9\" and \"Cornelius\", In 2008, his EP Cornelius was in the Top 100 International iTunes downloads.[citation needed].In 2009, the Bloody Beetroots released his first album, Romborama.[citation needed] The Bloody Beetroots DJ Set (Sir Rifo and ex-member Tommy Tea) had a short tour of the United States in early 2008, alongside DJ Steve Aoki.[citation needed].In 2009, Sir Rifo also worked on Rifoki, a hardcore punk band with Steve Aoki..Bloody Beetroots DJ Set played festivals including Stereosonic Festival in Australia, Ultra Music Festival in Miami and Rock Werchter in Belgium.[citation needed] During his 2010 Live Tour, Sir Rifo labeled himself and the live band the Bloody Beetroots Death Crew 77 and introduced drummer Edward Grinch.", "Pager": "A pager, also known as a beeper or bleeper,[1] is a wireless telecommunications device that receives and displays alphanumeric or voice messages.One-way pagers can only receive messages, while response pagers and two-way pagers can also acknowledge, reply to, and originate messages using an internal transmitter.[2] In Japanese, it was commonly called a pocket bell (\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30d9\u30eb, poketto beru) or pokeberu (\u30dd\u30b1\u30d9\u30eb),[3] which is an example of wasei-eigo..Pagers operate as part of a paging system which includes one or more fixed transmitters (or in the case of response pagers and two-way pagers, one or more base stations), as well as a number of pagers carried by mobile users.These systems can range from a restaurant system with a single low power transmitter, to a nationwide system with thousands of high-power base stations..Pagers were developed in the 1950s and 1960s,[4] and became widely used by the 1980s through the late 1990s and early 2000s.In the 21st century, the widespread availability of cellphones and smartphones with text messaging capability has greatly diminished the pager industry.Nevertheless, pagers continue to be used by some emergency services and public safety personnel, because modern pager systems' coverage overlap, combined with use of satellite communications, can make paging systems more reliable than terrestrial based cellular networks in some cases, including during natural and human-made disasters.[5] This resilience has led public safety agencies to adopt pagers over cellular and other commercial services for critical messaging.[6][7].The first telephone pager system was patented in 1949 by Alfred J.Gross.[8].One of the first practical paging services was launched in 1950 for physicians in the New York City area.Physicians paid US$12 per month for the service and carried a 200-gram (7oz) pager that would receive phone messages within 40 kilometres (25mi) of a single transmitter tower.The system was manufactured by the Reevesound Company and operated by Telanswerphone.[9] In 1960, John Francis Mitchell combined elements of Motorola's walkie-talkie and automobile radio technologies to create the first transistorized pager,[10][11][12] and from that time, paging technology continued to advance and pager adoption among emergency personnel is still popular as of July 2016.[13].", "Reevesville, South Carolina": "Reevesville is a town in Dorchester County, South Carolina, United States.The population was 196 at the 2010 census.As defined by the U.S.Office of Management and Budget, and used by the U.S.Census Bureau for statistical purposes only, Reevesville is included within the  Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville metropolitan area..Reevesville is located at 33\u00b012\u203215\u2033N 80\u00b038\u203250\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff33.20417\u00b0N 80.64722\u00b0W\ufeff / 33.20417; -80.64722

(0.1km2) of it (1.23%) is water..Reevesville is a predominantly agrarian community located between the banks of Cattle Creek and Polk Swamp near the Edisto River in Upper Dorchester County.The town\u2019s name originates from its time as a once bustling railroad community known as \u201cReeves Station\u201d.South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company built a railroad through the area in 1832 and shortly after, became known as \u201cReeves Station\u201d for local farmer, David D.Reeves.Reeves hailed from one of the area\u2019s original settling families and supplied wood as a source of fuel to the first locomotives to pass through the area.", "Frida Kahlo": "Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calder\u00f3n (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8f\u027ei\u00f0a \u02c8kalo]; 6 July 1907 \u2013 13 July 1954[1]) was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico.Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a na\u00efve folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society.[2] Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy.In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicayotl movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist.[3] She is also known for painting about her experience of chronic pain.[4].Born to a German father and a mestiza mother, Kahlo spent most of her childhood and adult life at La Casa Azul, her family home in Coyoac\u00e1n\u2013 now publicly accessible as the Frida Kahlo Museum.Although she was disabled by polio as a child, Kahlo had been a promising student headed for medical school until being injured in a bus accident at the age of 18, which caused her lifelong pain and medical problems.During her recovery, she returned to her childhood interest in art with the idea of becoming an artist..Kahlo's interests in politics and art led her to join the Mexican Communist Party in 1927,[1] through which she met fellow Mexican artist Diego Rivera.The couple married in 1929[1][5] and spent the late 1920s and early 1930s travelling in Mexico and the United States together.During this time, she developed her artistic style, drawing her main inspiration from Mexican folk culture, and painted mostly small self-portraits that mixed elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic beliefs.Her paintings raised the interest of surrealist artist Andr\u00e9 Breton, who arranged for Kahlo's first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938; the exhibition was a success and was followed by another in Paris in 1939.While the French exhibition was less successful, the Louvre purchased a painting from Kahlo, The Frame, making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection.[1] Throughout the 1940s, Kahlo participated in exhibitions in Mexico and the United States and worked as an art teacher.She taught at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado (\"La Esmeralda\") and was a founding member of the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana.", "Oktoberfest": "Oktoberfest (German pronunciation: [\u0254k\u02c8to\u02d0b\u0250\u02ccf\u025bst] \u24d8; Bavarian: Wiesn, Oktobafest) is the world's largest Volksfest, featuring a beer festival and a travelling carnival, and is held annually in Munich, Bavaria, from mid- or late-September to the first Sunday in October, with more than six million international and national visitors attending the event.Locally, it is called d'Wiesn, after the colloquial name for the fairgrounds, Theresienwiese.Oktoberfest is an important part of Bavarian culture, having been held since the year 1810.Other cities across the world also hold Oktoberfest celebrations that are modeled after the original Munich event..During the event, large quantities of Oktoberfest Beer are consumed: in 2014, 7.7million litres (2,000,000USgal) were served.[1][2] Visitors also enjoy numerous attractions, such as amusement rides, side stalls, and games.There is also a wide variety of traditional foods available..Oktoberfest originally took place in the 16-day period leading up to the first Sunday in October.In 1994, this longstanding schedule was modified in response to German reunification.As a result, if the first Sunday in October falls on the 1st or the 2nd, then the festival runs until 3 October (German Unity Day).Thus, the festival now runs for 17 days when the first Sunday is 2 October and 18 days when it is 1 October.In 2010, the festival lasted until the first Monday in October (4 October), to mark the event's bicentennial..Kronprinz Ludwig (1786\u20131868), later King Ludwig I (reign: 1825\u20131848), married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen on 12 October 1810.", "Cheese": "Cheese is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein.It comprises proteins and fat from milk (usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep).During production, milk is usually acidified and either the enzymes of rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate.The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese.[1] Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout..Over a thousand types of cheese exist and are produced in various countries.Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and how long they have been aged.Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents.The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding annatto.Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives, or cranberries.A cheesemonger, or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting, purchasing, receiving, storing and ripening cheeses.[2].For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice.Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling.", "Legal citation signals": "In law, a citation or introductory signal is a set of phrases or words used to clarify the authority (or significance) of a legal citation as it relates to a proposition.It is used in citations to present authorities and indicate how those authorities relate to propositions in statements.Legal writers use citation signals to tell readers how the citations support (or do not support) their propositions, organizing citations in a hierarchy of importance so the reader can quickly determine the relative weight of a citation.Citation signals help a reader to discern meaning or usefulness of a reference when the reference itself provides inadequate information..Citation signals have different meanings in different U.S.citation-style systems.The two most prominent citation manuals are The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation[1] and the ALWD Citation Manual.[2] Some state-specific style manuals also provide guidance on legal citation.The Bluebook citation system is the most comprehensive and the most widely used system by courts, law firms and law reviews.[citation needed].Most citation signals are placed in front of the citation to which they apply.In the paragraph:.When writing a legal argument, it is important to refer to primary sources.To assist readers in locating these sources, it is desirable to use a standardized citation format.", "Neil Armstrong": "Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930\u2013 August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer who in 1969 became the first person to walk on the Moon.He was also a naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor..Armstrong was born and raised in Wapakoneta, Ohio.He entered Purdue University, studying aeronautical engineering, with the U.S.Navy paying his tuition under the Holloway Plan.He became a midshipman in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year.He saw action in the Korean War, flying the Grumman F9F Panther from the aircraft carrier USSEssex.After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in California.He was the project pilot on Century Series fighters and flew the North American X-15 seven times.He was also a participant in the U.S.Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs..Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group, which was selected in 1962.", "Secretariat (horse)": "Secretariat (March 30, 1970 \u2013 October 4, 1989), also known as Big Red, was a champion American thoroughbred racehorse who was the ninth winner of the American Triple Crown, setting and still holding the fastest time record in all three of its constituent races.He is considered by many to be the greatest racehorse of all time.He became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years and his record-breaking victory in the Belmont Stakes, which he won by 31 lengths, is widely regarded as one of the greatest races in history.During his racing career, he won five Eclipse Awards, including Horse of the Year honors at ages two and three.He was nominated to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974.In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S.Racehorses of the 20th Century, Secretariat was second to Man o' War..At age two, Secretariat finished fourth in his 1972 debut in a maiden race, but then won seven of his remaining eight starts, including five stakes victories.His only loss during this period was in the Champagne Stakes, where he finished first but was disqualified to second for interference.He received the Eclipse Award for champion two-year-old colt, and also was the 1972 Horse of the Year, a rare honor for a horse so young..At age three, Secretariat not only won the Triple Crown, but he also set speed records in all three races.His time in the Kentucky Derby still stands as the Churchill Downs track record for 1+1\u20444 miles, and his time in the Belmont Stakes stands as the American record for 1+1\u20442 miles on the dirt.", "Madrid": "Madrid (/m\u0259\u02c8dr\u026ad/ m\u0259-DRID, Spanish: [ma\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei\u00f0] \u24d8)[n.1] is the capital and most populous city of Spain.The city has almost 3.4million[7] inhabitants and a metropolitan area population of approximately 6.7million.It is the second-largest city in the European Union (EU), and its monocentric metropolitan area is the second-largest in the EU.[8][9][10] The municipality covers 604.3km2 (233.3sqmi) geographical area.[11] Madrid lies on the River Manzanares in the central part of the Iberian Peninsula at about 650 metres above mean sea level.Capital city of both Spain and the surrounding autonomous community of Madrid (since 1983),[12] it is also the political, economic and cultural centre of the country.[13] The climate of Madrid features hot summers and cool winters..The Madrid urban agglomeration has the second-largest GDP[14] in the European Union and its influence in politics, education, entertainment, environment, media, fashion, science, culture, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the world's major global cities.[15][16] Due to its economic output, high standard of living, and market size, Madrid is considered the major financial centre[17] and the leading economic hub of the Iberian Peninsula and of Southern Europe.[18][19] The metropolitan area hosts major Spanish companies such as Telef\u00f3nica, Iberia, BBVA and FCC.[20] It concentrates the bulk of banking operations in the country and it is the Spanish-speaking city generating the largest amount of webpages.[20] For innovation, Madrid is ranked 19th in the world and 7th in Europe from 500 cities, in the 2022\u20132023 annual analysts Innovation Cities Index, published by 2ThinkNow.[21].Madrid houses the headquarters of the UN's World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB), the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), and the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB).It also hosts major international regulators and promoters of the Spanish language: the Standing Committee of the Association of Spanish Language Academies, headquarters of the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE), the Instituto Cervantes and the Foundation of Urgent Spanish (Fund\u00e9uRAE).Madrid organises fairs such as FITUR,[22] ARCO,[23] SIMO TCI[24] and the Madrid Fashion Week.[25] Madrid is home to two world-famous football clubs, Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid..While Madrid possesses modern infrastructure, it has preserved the look and feel of many of its historic neighbourhoods and streets.Its landmarks include the Plaza Mayor, the Royal Palace of Madrid; the Royal Theatre with its restored 1850 Opera House; the Buen Retiro Park, founded in 1631; the 19th-century National Library building (founded in 1712) containing some of Spain's historical archives; many national museums,[26] and the Golden Triangle of Art, located along the Paseo del Prado and comprising three art museums: Prado Museum, the Reina Sof\u00eda Museum, a museum of modern art, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, which complements the holdings of the other two museums.[27] Cibeles Palace and Fountain has become one of the monument symbols of the city.[28][29] The mayor is Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida from the People's Party.[30].There are various theories regarding the origin of the toponym \"Madrid\" (all of them with problems when it comes to fully explain the phonetic evolution of the toponym along history), namely:[31].", "Appian Way": "The Appian Way (Latin and Italian: Via Appia) is one of the earliest and strategically most important Roman roads of the ancient republic.It connected Rome to Brindisi, in southeast Italy.[1] Its importance is indicated by its common name, recorded by Statius,[2][3] of Appia longarum...regina viarum (\"the Appian Way, the queen of the long roads\")..The road is named after Appius Claudius Caecus,[4] the Roman censor who began and completed the first section as a military road to the south in 312 BC[5] during the Samnite Wars..The Appian Way was a Roman road used as a main route for military supplies for its conquest of southern Italy in 312 BC and for improvements in communication.[6][7].The Appian Way was the first long road built specifically to transport troops outside the smaller region of greater Rome (this was essential to the Romans).The few roads outside the early city were Etruscan and went mainly to Etruria.By the late Republic, the Romans had expanded over most of Italy and were masters of road construction.Their roads began at Rome, where the master itinerarium, or list of destinations along the roads, was located, and extended to the borders of their domain\u2013 hence the expression, \"All roads lead to Rome\"..Romans had an affinity for the people of Campania, who, like themselves, traced their backgrounds to the Etruscans.The Samnite Wars were instigated by the Samnites when Rome attempted to ally itself with the city of Capua in Campania.The Italic speakers in Latium had long ago been subdued and incorporated into the Roman state.", "Rogue wave": "Rogue waves (also known as freak waves, monster waves, episodic waves, killer waves, extreme waves, and abnormal waves) are unusually large, unpredictable, and suddenly appearing surface waves that can be extremely dangerous to ships and isolated structures such as lighthouses.[1] They are distinct from tsunamis, which are often almost unnoticeable in deep waters and are caused by the displacement of water due to other phenomena (such as earthquakes).A rogue wave at the shore is sometimes called a sneaker wave.[2].In oceanography, rogue waves are more precisely defined as waves whose height is more than twice the significant wave height (Hs or SWH), itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record.Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single exceptionally large wave.[1].Among other causes, studies of nonlinear waves such as the Peregrine soliton, and waves modeled by the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NLS), suggest that modulational instability can create an unusual sea state where a \"normal\" wave begins to draw energy from other nearby waves, and briefly becomes very large.Such phenomena are not limited to water and are also studied in liquid helium, nonlinear optics, and microwave cavities.A 2012 study reported that in addition to the Peregrine soliton reaching up to about three times the height of the surrounding sea, a hierarchy of higher order wave solutions could also exist having progressively larger sizes, and demonstrated the creation of a \"super rogue wave\" \u2014a breather around five times higher than surrounding waves\u2014 in a water-wave tank.[3].A 2012 study supported the existence of oceanic rogue holes, the inverse of rogue waves, where the depth of the hole can reach more than twice the significant wave height.Rogue holes have been replicated in experiments using water-wave tanks but have not been confirmed in the real world.[4].Rogue waves are open-water phenomena, in which winds, currents, nonlinear phenomena such as solitons, and other circumstances cause a wave to briefly form that is far larger than the \"average\" large wave (the significant wave height or \"SWH\") of that time and place.The basic underlying physics that makes phenomena such as rogue waves possible is that different waves can travel at different speeds, so they can \"pile up\" in certain circumstances, known as \"constructive interference\".(In deep ocean, the speed of a gravity wave is proportional to the square root of its wavelength, the peak-to-peak distance between adjacent waves.) However, other situations can also give rise to rogue waves, particularly situations where nonlinear effects or instability effects can cause energy to move between waves and be concentrated in one or very few extremely large waves before returning to \"normal\" conditions..", "Line of succession to the British throne": "Succession to the British throne is determined by descent, sex,[note 1] legitimacy, and religion.Under common law, the Crown is inherited by a sovereign's children or by a childless sovereign's nearest collateral line.The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701 restrict succession to the throne to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover who are in \"communion with the Church of England\".[1] Spouses of Catholics were disqualified from 1689 until the law was amended in 2015.Protestant descendants of those excluded for being Roman Catholics are eligible.[2].King Charles III is the sovereign, and his heir apparent is his elder son, William, Prince of Wales.William's three children are next, in order of birth: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis.Fifth in line is Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the younger son of the King; sixth is Harry's elder child, Prince Archie.Under the Perth Agreement, which came into effect in 2015, only the first six in line of succession require the sovereign's consent before they marry; without such consent, they and their children would be disqualified from succession..The United Kingdom is one of the Commonwealth realms, which are sovereign states that share the same person as monarch and the same order of succession.In 2011, the prime ministers of the then-16 realms agreed unanimously to amend the rules of succession.Male-preference primogeniture was abandoned, meaning that males born after 28 October 2011 no longer precede females in line, and the ban on marriages to Catholics was lifted.The monarch still needs to be in communion with the Church of England.", "Montgomery Clift": "Edward Montgomery Clift (/m\u0252nt\u02c8\u0261\u028cm\u0259ri/; October 17, 1920 \u2013 July 23, 1966) was an American actor.A four-time Academy Award nominee, he was known for his portrayal of \"moody, sensitive young men\", according to The New York Times.[1][2].He is best remembered for his roles in Howard Hawks's Red River (1948), George Stevens's A Place in the Sun (1951), Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity (1953), Stanley Kramer's Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and John Huston's The Misfits (1961)..Along with Marlon Brando and James Dean, Clift was considered one of the original method actors in Hollywood (though Clift distanced himself from the term); he was one of the first actors to be invited to study in the Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg and Elia Kazan.[3] He also executed a rare move by not signing a contract after arriving in Hollywood, only doing so after his first two films were a success.This was described as \"a power differential that would go on to structure the star\u2013studio relationship for the next 40 years\".[4] A documentary titled Making Montgomery Clift was made by his nephew in 2018, to clarify myths that were created about the actor.[5].Edward Montgomery Clift was born on October 17, 1920, in Omaha, Nebraska.His father, William Brooks \"Bill\" Clift (1886\u20131964), was the vice-president of Omaha National Trust Company.[6] His mother was Ethel Fogg \"Sunny\" Clift (n\u00e9e Anderson; 1888\u20131988).His parents were Quakers and met as students at Cornell University, marrying in 1914.[7][8] Clift had a twin sister, Roberta (who later went by \"Ethel\"), who survived him by 48 years, and an older brother, William Brooks Clift, Jr.(1919\u20131986), known as \"Brooks,\" who had a son with actress Kim Stanley and was later married to political reporter Eleanor Clift.[9] Clift had English and Scottish ancestry on his father's side, wealthy relatives who hailed from Chattanooga, Tennessee.His mother, Sunny, was adopted; she maintained that Clift\u2019s true maternal great-grandfathers were the US postmaster-general Montgomery Blair and Union commander Robert Anderson, a part of her lineage that was clarified to her (when she came of age) by Dr.Edward Montgomery, the family doctor who delivered her.[10][11] She spent the rest of her life trying to gain the recognition of her alleged relations..Part of Clift's mother's effort was her determination that her children should be brought up in the style of aristocrats.", "War on Terror": "Major wars ended and heavy fighting mostly ceased.Al-Qaeda insurgency in Yemen (since 1998):[note 4].War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021):.Iraqi conflict (since 2003):.American-led intervention in the Syrian civil war

campaign initiated by the United States following the September 11 attacks and is the most recent global conflict spanning multiple wars.The main targets of the campaign are militant Islamist movements like al-Qaeda, Taliban and their allies.Other major targets included the Ba'athist regime in Iraq, which was deposed in an invasion in 2003, and various militant factions that fought during the ensuing insurgency.", "Causes of World War II": "The causes of World War II have been given considerable attention by historians.The immediate precipitating event was the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany on September 1, 1939, and the subsequent declarations of war on Germany made by Britain and France, but many other prior events have been suggested as ultimate causes.Primary themes in historical analysis of the war's origins include the political takeover of Germany in 1933 by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party; Japanese militarism against China, which led to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and the Second Sino-Japanese War; Italian aggression against Ethiopia, which led to the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the consent of Western countries to Germany's actions on the annexation of Austria and the partition of Czechoslovakia and Germany's initial success in negotiating the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviet Union to divide the territorial control of Eastern Europe between them..During the interwar period, deep anger arose in the Weimar Republic on the conditions of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which punished Germany for its role in World War I with heavy financial reparations and severe limitations on its military that were intended to prevent it from becoming a military power again.The demilitarisation of the Rhineland, the prohibition of German unification with Austria, the loss of its overseas colonies and of some 12% of its pre-war land area and population provoked strong currents of revanchism in German politics..During the worldwide economic crisis of the Great Depression in the 1930s, many people lost faith in liberal democracy and countries across the world turned to authoritarian regimes.[1] In Germany, resentment over the terms of the Treaty of Versailles was intensified by the instability of the German political system, as many on both the Right and the Left rejected the Weimar Republic liberalism.The most extreme political aspirant to emerge from that situation was Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi Party.The Nazis took totalitarian power in Germany from 1933 and demanded the undoing of the Versailles provisions.Their ambitious and aggressive domestic and foreign policies reflected their ideologies of Antisemitism, unification of all Germans, the acquisition of \"living space\" (Lebensraum) for agrarian settlers, the elimination of Bolshevism and the hegemony of an \"Aryan\"/\"Nordic\" master race over \"subhumans\" (Untermenschen) such as Jews and Slavs.Other factors leading to the war included the aggression by Fascist Italy against Ethiopia and by Imperial Japan against China..At first, the aggressive moves met with only feeble and ineffectual policies of appeasement from the other major world powers.The League of Nations proved helpless, especially regarding China and Ethiopia.", "List of Greek mythological figures": "The following is a list of gods, goddesses, and many other divine and semi-divine figures from ancient Greek mythology and ancient Greek religion..The Greeks created images of their deities for many purposes.A temple would house the statue of a god or goddess, or multiple deities, and might be decorated with relief scenes depicting myths.Divine images were common on coins.Drinking cups and other vessels were painted with scenes from Greek myths..Goddess of beauty, love, desire, and pleasure.In Hesiod's Theogony (188\u2013206), she was born from sea-foam and the severed genitals of Uranus; in Homer's Iliad (5.370\u2013417), she is daughter of Zeus and Dione.She was married to Hephaestus, but bore him no children.She had many lovers, most notably Ares, to whom she bore Harmonia, Phobos, and Deimos.She was also a lover to Adonis and Anchises, to whom she bore Aeneas.She is usually depicted as a naked or semi-nude beautiful woman.Her symbols include the magical girdle, myrtle, roses, and the scallop shell.", "Mitsubishi Galant": "The Mitsubishi Galant (Japanese: \u4e09\u83f1\u30fb\u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30f3, Mitsubishi Gyaran) is an automobile which was produced by Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi from 1969 until 2012.The model name was derived from the French word galant, meaning \"chivalrous\".[3] There have been nine distinct generations with total cumulative sales exceeding five million units.[4] It began as a compact sedan, but over the course of its life evolved into a mid-size car.Initial production was based in Japan, but from 1994 the American market was served by vehicles assembled at the former Diamond-Star Motors (DSM) facility in Normal, Illinois..The first generation of the car, initially known as the Colt Galant, was released in December 1969 at a new Mitsubishi Japanese dealership called Galant Shop.The design was dubbed \"Dynawedge\" by Mitsubishi, referring to the influence of aerodynamics on the silhouette.[4] Three models were available, powered by the new 'Saturn' engine in 1.3- (AI model) or 1.5-liter (AII and AIII) configurations.1.4- and 1.6-liter versions (14L and 16L) replaced these in September 1971.A larger 115PS (85kW) 1.7-liter arrived for the top GS model in January 1973.[8] Initially only available as a four-door sedan, five-door estate and two-door hardtop (A53) variants were added in 1970.The hardtop was Mitsubishi's first production passenger car with full side windows and no side pillars.In March 1973, with only two months of production left, the cleaner \"MCA-II\" version of the 1.6 arrived.With 97PS (71kW) it was three horsepower down on the regular version.[8].The Galant was offered as a competitor to the Toyota Corona, Nissan Bluebird, Honda Accord, and Mazda Capella.It became Mitsubishi's first car to be sold in the United States in 1971 when the Chrysler Corporation, the company's new partner and stakeholder, began importing the car as the Dodge Colt.", "Blood pressure": "Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure of circulating blood against the walls of blood vessels.Most of this pressure results from the heart pumping blood through the circulatory system.When used without qualification, the term \"blood pressure\" refers to the pressure in a brachial artery, where it is most commonly measured.Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum pressure during one heartbeat) over diastolic pressure (minimum pressure between two heartbeats) in the cardiac cycle.It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) above the surrounding atmospheric pressure, or in kilopascals (kPa)..Blood pressure is one of the vital signs\u2014together with respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature\u2014that healthcare professionals use in evaluating a patient's health.Normal resting blood pressure,  in an adult is approximately 120 millimetres of mercury (16kPa) systolic over 80 millimetres of mercury (11kPa) diastolic, denoted as \"120/80mmHg\".Globally, the average blood pressure, age standardized,  has remained about the same since 1975 to the present, at approx.127/79 mmHg in men and 122/77 mmHg in women, although these average data mask significantly diverging regional trends.[1].Traditionally, a health-care worker measured blood pressure non-invasively by auscultation (listening) through a stethoscope for sounds in one arm's artery as the artery is squeezed, closer to the heart, by an aneroid gauge or a mercury-tube sphygmomanometer.[2] Auscultation is still generally considered to be the gold standard of accuracy for non-invasive blood pressure readings in clinic.[3] However, semi-automated methods have become common, largely due to concerns about potential mercury toxicity,[4] although cost, ease of use and applicability to ambulatory blood pressure or home blood pressure measurements have also influenced this trend.[5] Early automated alternatives to mercury-tube sphygmomanometers were often seriously inaccurate, but modern devices validated to international standards achieve an average difference between two standardized reading methods of 5mm Hg or less, and a standard deviation of less than 8mm Hg.[5] Most of these semi-automated methods measure blood pressure using oscillometry (measurement by a pressure transducer in the cuff of the device of small oscillations of.intra-cuff pressure accompanying heartbeat-induced changes in the volume of each pulse).[6].Blood pressure is influenced by cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, blood volume and arterial stiffness, and varies depending on patient's situation, emotional state, activity and relative health or disease state.", "Veto": "A veto is a legal power to unilaterally stop an official action.In the most typical case, a president or monarch vetoes a bill to stop it from becoming law.In many countries, veto powers are established in the country's constitution.Veto powers are also found at other levels of government, such as in state, provincial or local government, and in international bodies..Some vetoes can be overcome, often by a supermajority vote: in the United States, a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate can override a presidential veto.[1] Some vetoes, however, are absolute and cannot be overridden.For example, in the United Nations Security Council, the five permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) have an absolute veto over any Security Council resolution..In many cases, the veto power can only be used to prevent changes to the status quo.But some veto powers also include the ability to make or propose changes.For example, the Indian president can use an amendatory veto to propose amendments to vetoed bills..The executive power to veto legislation is one of the main tools that the executive has in the legislative process, along with the proposal power.[2] It is most commonly found in presidential and semi-presidential systems.[3] In parliamentary systems, the head of state often has either a weak veto power or none at all.[4] But while some political systems do not contain a formal veto power, all political systems contain veto players, people or groups who can use social and political power to prevent policy change.[5].The word \"veto\" comes from the Latin for \"I forbid\".The concept of a veto originated with the Roman offices of consul and tribune of the plebs.", "Sulfur dioxide": "Selenium dioxide.Sulfurous acid.Tellurium dioxide.Sulfur dioxide (IUPAC-recommended spelling) or sulphur dioxide (traditional Commonwealth English) is the chemical compound with the formula SO2.It is a toxic gas responsible for the odor of burnt matches.It is released naturally by volcanic activity and is produced as a by-product of copper extraction and the burning of sulfur-bearing fossil fuels.[8].SO2 is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry point group..A valence bond theory approach considering just s and p orbitals would describe the bonding in terms of resonance between two resonance structures..The sulfur\u2013oxygen bond has a bond order of 1.5.There is support for this simple approach that does not invoke d orbital participation.[9].In terms of electron-counting formalism, the sulfur atom has an oxidation state of +4 and a formal charge of +1..Sulfur dioxide is found on Earth and exists in very small concentrations in the atmosphere at about 15 ppb.[10].", "Myasthenia Gravis": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a long-term neuromuscular junction disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness.[1] The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing.[1][5] It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking.[1] Onset can be sudden.[1] Those affected often have a large thymus or develop a thymoma.[1].Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuro-muscular junction which results from antibodies that block or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the junction between the nerve and muscle.[6][7][1] This prevents nerve impulses from triggering muscle contractions.[1] Most cases are due to immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG3 antibodies that attack AChR in the postsynaptic membrane, causing complement-mediated damage and muscle weakness.[8] Rarely, an inherited genetic defect in the neuromuscular junction results in a similar condition known as congenital myasthenia.[9][10] Babies of mothers with myasthenia may have symptoms during their first few months of life, known as neonatal myasthenia.[1] Diagnosis can be supported by blood tests for specific antibodies, the edrophonium test, or a nerve conduction study.[1].MG is generally treated with medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine.[1] Immunosuppressants, such as prednisone or azathioprine, may also be used.[1] The surgical removal of the thymus may improve symptoms in certain cases.[1] Plasmapheresis and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin may be used during sudden flares of the condition.[1] If the breathing muscles become significantly weak, mechanical ventilation may be required.[1] Once intubated acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be temporarily held to reduce airway secretions.[11].MG affects 50 to 200 people per million.[3][4] It is newly diagnosed in 3 to 30 people per million each year.[12] Diagnosis has become more common due to increased awareness.[12] MG most commonly occurs in women under the age of 40 and in men over the age of 60.[1][13][14] It is uncommon in children.[1] With treatment, most of those affected lead relatively normal lives and have a normal life expectancy.[1] The word is from the Greek mys, \"muscle\" and astheneia \"weakness\", and the Latin gravis, \"serious\".[15].The initial, main symptom in MG is painless weakness of specific muscles, not fatigue.[16] The muscle weakness becomes progressively worse during periods of physical activity and improves after periods of rest.Typically, the weakness and fatigue are worse toward the end of the day.[17] MG generally starts with ocular (eye) weakness; it might then progress to a more severe generalized form, characterized by weakness in the extremities or in muscles that govern basic life functions.[18].In about two-thirds of individuals, the initial symptom of MG is related to the muscles around the eye.[16] Eyelid drooping (ptosis may occur due to weakness of m.levator palpebrae superioris)[19] and double vision (diplopia,[16] due to weakness of the extraocular muscles).[17] Eye symptoms tend to get worse when watching television, reading, or driving, particularly in bright conditions.[16] Consequently, some affected individuals choose to wear sunglasses.[16] The term \"ocular myasthenia gravis\" describes a subtype of MG where muscle weakness is confined to the eyes, i.e.extraocular muscles, m.levator palpebrae superioris, and m.orbicularis oculi.[19] Typically, this subtype evolves into generalized MG, usually after a few years.[19].The weakness of the muscles involved in swallowing may lead to swallowing difficulty (dysphagia).", "Liquid-crystal display": "A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers.Liquid crystals do not emit light directly[1] but instead use a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome.[2] LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images with low information content, which can be displayed or hidden: preset words, digits, and seven-segment displays (as in a digital clock) are all examples of devices with these displays.They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are made from a matrix of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements.LCDs can either be normally on (positive) or off (negative), depending on the polarizer arrangement.For example, a character positive LCD with a backlight will have black lettering on a background that is the color of the backlight, and a character negative LCD will have a black background with the letters being of the same color as the backlight.Optical filters are added to white on blue LCDs to give them their characteristic appearance..LCDs are used in a wide range of applications, including LCD televisions, computer monitors, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays, and indoor and outdoor signage.Small LCD screens are common in LCD projectors and portable consumer devices such as digital cameras, watches, calculators, and mobile telephones, including smartphones.LCD screens have replaced heavy, bulky and less energy-efficient cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays in nearly all applications.The phosphors used in CRTs make them vulnerable to image burn-in when a static image is displayed on a screen for a long time, e.g., the table frame for an airline flight schedule on an indoor sign.LCDs do not have this weakness, but are still susceptible to image persistence.[3].Each pixel of an LCD typically consists of a layer of molecules aligned between two transparent electrodes, often made of indium tin oxide (ITO) and two polarizing filters (parallel and perpendicular polarizers), the axes of transmission of which are (in most of the cases) perpendicular to each other.", "The Borgata": "Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa is a hotel, casino, and spa in Atlantic City, New Jersey.It is owned by Vici Properties and operated by MGM Resorts International.The casino hotel features 2,798 rooms and is the largest hotel in New Jersey.Borgata opened in July 2003 and is the top-grossing casino in Atlantic City..Borgata was part of a major project in Atlantic City nicknamed \"The Tunnel Project\", started around 1999.When Steve Wynn planned the Le Jardin in Atlantic City, he wanted to connect a $330 million 2.5-mile (4.0km) tunnel from the Atlantic City Expressway to the new resort, later named the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, which would funnel incoming traffic off the Atlantic City Expressway into the city's marina district.This caused major controversy, as it would cut through a residential neighborhood; competitor Donald Trump sued Wynn for it saying that it was a \"driveway\" to Wynn's casino.The Tunnel Project did progress, even after Le Jardin was cancelled, and finally opened in 2001..Borgata opened on July 2, 2003, at 11:45pm, as a joint venture between MGM Mirage and Boyd Gaming.The main tower - the third tallest building in Atlantic City - is visible from many miles away due to its facade of reflective gold glass.The firms Marnell Corrao Associates of Las Vegas, and Philadelphia\u2019s Bower Lewis and Thrower Architects (BLT) worked on the project.[2].In late 2005 and

called vitamers) that are essential to an organism in small quantities for proper metabolic function.Essential nutrients cannot be synthesized in the organism in sufficient quantities for survival, and therefore must be obtained through the diet.For example, Vitamin C can be synthesized by some species but not by others; it is not considered a vitamin in the first instance but is in the second.Most vitamins are not single molecules, but groups of related molecules called vitamers.For example, there are eight vitamers of vitamin E: four tocopherols and four tocotrienols..The term vitamin does not include the three other groups of essential nutrients: minerals, essential fatty acids, and essential amino acids.[2].Major health organizations list thirteen vitamins:[3][4][5].Some sources include a fourteenth, choline.[6].Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions.Vitamin A acts as a regulator of cell and tissue growth and differentiation.Vitamin D provides a hormone-like function, regulating mineral metabolism for bones and other organs.The B complex vitamins function as enzyme cofactors (coenzymes) or the precursors for them.", "Islam by country": "Adherents of Islam constitute the world's second largest religious group.A projection by the PEW suggests that Muslims numbered approximately 1.9 billion followers in 2020.[2][3] Studies in the 21st century suggest that, in terms of percentage and worldwide spread, Islam is the fastest-growing major religion in the world, mostly because Muslims have more children than other major religious groups.[4][5] Most Muslims are either of two denominations: Sunni (87\u201390%, roughly 1.7 billion people)[6] or Shia (10\u201313%, roughly 180\u2013230 million people).[7] Islam is the majority religion in several subregions: Central Asia, Western Asia, North Africa, West Africa, the Sahel, and the Middle East.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14] The diverse Asia-Pacific region contains the highest number of Muslims in the world, easily surpassing the combined Middle East and North Africa.[15].According to the Pew Research Center in 2010, there were 50 Muslim-majority countries.[16][17] Around 62% of the world's Muslims live in the Asia-Pacific region (from Turkey to Indonesia), with over one billion adherents.[18] The largest Muslim population in a country is in Indonesia, a country home to 12.7% of the world's Muslims, followed by Pakistan (11.1%), India (10.9%) and Bangladesh (9.2%).[8][19].About 20% of Muslims live in the Arab world.[20] In the Middle East, Iran and Turkey are the largest Muslim-majority countries, while Egypt and Nigeria in Africa have the same status.[8][19].South Asia has the largest population of Muslims in the world, with about one-third of all Muslims being from South Asia.[21][22][23] Islam is the dominant religion in the Maldives, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.India is the country with the largest Muslim population outside Muslim-majority countries with more than 200 million adherents.[24].The Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region hosts 23% of the world's Muslims, and Islam is the dominant religion in every country in the region[25] other than Israel,[9].The country with the single largest population of Muslims is Indonesia in Southeast Asia, which on its own hosts 13% of the world's Muslims.[26] Together, the Muslims in the countries of Southeast Asia constitute the world's third-largest population of Muslims.In the countries of the Malay Archipelago, Muslims are in the majority in Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia..About 15% of Muslims reside in Sub-Saharan Africa,[27][pageneeded][10][28] and sizeable Muslim communities are also found in the Americas, Russia, China and Europe.[8].Western Europe hosts many Muslim immigrant communities where Islam is the second-largest religion after Christianity, where it represents 6% of the total population or 24 million people.[29].Islam is divided into two major denominations, Sunni and Shi'a.", "Rhode Island": "Rhode Island (/\u02ccro\u028ad-/ \u24d8)[6][7] is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States.It is the smallest U.S.state by area and the seventh-least populous, with slightly fewer than 1.1 million residents as of 2020;[8] but Rhode Island has grown at every decennial count since 1790 and is the second-most densely populated state, after New Jersey.The state takes its name from the eponymous island, though nearly all its land area is on the mainland.Rhode Island borders Connecticut to its west; Massachusetts to its north and east; and the Atlantic Ocean to its south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound; and shares a small maritime border with New York, east of Long Island.[9] Providence is its capital and most populous city..Native Americans lived around Narragansett Bay for thousands of years before English settlers began arriving in the early 17th century.[10] Rhode Island was unique among the Thirteen British Colonies in having been founded by a refugee, Roger Williams, who fled religious persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to establish a haven for religious liberty.He founded Providence in 1636 on land purchased from local tribes, creating the first settlement in North America with an explicitly secular government.[10] The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations subsequently became a destination for religious and political dissenters and social outcasts, earning it the moniker \"Rogue's Island.\"[11].Rhode Island was the first colony to call for a Continental Congress, which it did in 1774, and the first to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown, which it did on May 4, 1776.[12] After the American Revolution, during which it was heavily occupied and contested, Rhode Island became the fourth state to ratify the Articles of Confederation, which it did on February 9, 1778.[13] Because its citizens favored a weaker central government, it boycotted the 1787 convention that had drafted the United States Constitution,[14] which it initially refused to ratify;[15] it finally did ratify it on May 29, 1790, the last of the original 13 states to do so.[16][17].The state was officially named the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations since the colonial era, but came to be commonly known as \"Rhode Island\".In November 2020, the state's voters approved an amendment to the state constitution formally dropping \"and Providence Plantations\" from its full name.[18] Its official nickname is the \"Ocean State\", a reference to its 400mi (640km) of coastline and the large bays and inlets that make up about 14% of its total area.[19].Despite its name, most of Rhode Island is on the mainland of the United States.Its official name was State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations from its beginning in 1636 until 2020.", "Dubai": "Dubai (/du\u02d0\u02c8ba\u026a/, doo-BY; Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u064a, romanized:Dubayy, IPA: [d\u028a\u02c8bajj], Gulf Arabic pronunciation: [d\u0259\u02c8baj]) is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, the most populated of the country's seven emirates.[7][8][9].Established in the 19th century as a small fishing village, Dubai grew into a regional trading hub from the early 20th century and grew rapidly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries with a focus on tourism and luxury.[10] It is second-most in five-star hotels in the world[11] and boasts the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is 828 metres (2,717ft) tall.[12].In the eastern Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf,[13] it is a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo.[14] Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub..A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate and financial services.[15][16][17][18] Oil production contributed less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in 2018.[19] The city has a population of around 3.49 million (as of 2021).[20].Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word \"Dubai\".One theory suggests the word used to be the souq in Ba.[21] An Arabic proverb says \"Daba Dubai\" (Arabic: \u062f\u0628\u0627 \u062f\u0628\u064a), meaning \"They came with a lot of money.\"[22].According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE's history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word dabba (Arabic: \u062f\u0628) (a past tense derivative of yadub (Arabic: \u064a\u062f\u0628), which means \"to creep\"), referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland..The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of \"baby locust\" (Arabic: \u062c\u0631\u0627\u062f) due to the abundance of locusts in the area before settlement.[23].The history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is rich and  complex.It points to extensive trading links between the civilisations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, and even as far afield as the Levant.[24] Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, Al Sufouh and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid[25] show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit periods, the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods and the three Iron Ages in the UAE.The area was known to the Sumerians as Magan and was a source for metallic goods, notably copper and bronze.[26].The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming part of the city's present coastline.[27] Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries.[28] Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area, the people in this region worshiped Bajir (or Bajar).[28] After the spread of Islam in the region, the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world conquered south-east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians.", "List of colleges and universities in Illinois": "The following is a list of colleges and

known as the sea or the world ocean) is a body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water.[9] The term ocean also refers to any of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided.[10] Distinct names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic (the smallest).[11][12] Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000km2 (139,000,000sqmi) of the planet.The ocean is the primary component of the Earth's hydrosphere, and thus essential to life on Earth.The ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle by acting as a huge heat reservoir..Oceanographers split the ocean into vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions.The pelagic zone is the open ocean's water column from the surface to the ocean floor.The water column is further divided into zones based on depth and the amount of light present.The photic zone starts at the surface and is defined to be \"the depth at which light intensity is only 1% of the surface value\"[13]:\u200a36\u200a (approximately 200m in the open ocean).This is the zone where photosynthesis can occur.In this process plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) use light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients to produce organic matter.As a result, the photic zone is the most biodiverse and the source of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem.Ocean photosynthesis also produces half of the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere.[14] Light can only penetrate a few hundred more meters; the rest of the deeper ocean is cold and dark (these zones are called mesopelagic and aphotic zones).", "Elvis Presley": "Elvis Aaron Presley[a] (January 8, 1935 \u2013 August 16, 1977), commonly referred to by his first name, Elvis, was an American singer and actor.Known as the \"King of Rock and Roll\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century.Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, brought both great success and initial controversy..Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi; his family relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was 13.His music career began there in 1954, at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience.Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues.In 1955, drummer D.J.Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades.Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States.Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles.With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans[6] led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of white American youth.[7].In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender.", "Root beer": "Root beer is a sweet North American soft drink traditionally made using the root bark of the sassafras tree Sassafras albidum or the vine of Smilax ornata (known as sarsaparilla, also used to make a soft drink, sarsaparilla) as the primary flavor.Root beer is typically, but not exclusively, non-alcoholic, caffeine-free, sweet, and carbonated.Like cola, it usually has a thick and foamy head.A common use is to add vanilla ice cream to make a root beer float..Since safrole, a key component of sassafras, was banned by the U.S.Food and Drug Administration in 1960 due to its carcinogenicity, most commercial root beers have been flavored using artificial sassafras flavoring,[1][2] but a few (e.g.Hansen's) use a safrole-free sassafras extract.[3].Major root beer producers include PepsiCo, Coca-Cola Company, Dad's, Keurig Dr.Pepper, and A&W..Root beer has been drunk in the United States since at least the eighteenth century.It has been sold in confectionery stores since at least the 1840s, and written recipes for root beer have been documented since the 1860s.In the nineteenth century, it was often consumed hot.", "Fluorescence": "Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation.It is a form of luminescence.In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore a lower photon energy, than the absorbed radiation.A perceptible example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum (invisible to the human eye), while the emitted light is in the visible region; this gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can only be seen when the substance has been exposed to UV light.Fluorescent materials cease to glow nearly immediately when the radiation source stops, unlike phosphorescent materials, which continue to emit light for some time after..Fluorescence has many practical applications, including mineralogy, gemology, medicine, chemical sensors (fluorescence spectroscopy), fluorescent labelling, dyes, biological detectors, cosmic-ray detection, vacuum fluorescent displays, and cathode-ray tubes.Its most common everyday application is in (gas-discharge) fluorescent lamps and LED lamps, in which fluorescent coatings convert UV or blue light into longer-wavelengths resulting in white light which can even appear indistinguishable from that of the traditional but energy- inefficient incandescent lamp..Fluorescence also occurs frequently in nature in some minerals and in many biological forms across all kingdoms of life.The latter may be referred to as biofluorescence, indicating that the fluorophore is part of or is extracted from a living organism (rather than an inorganic dye or stain).But since fluorescence is due to a specific chemical, which can also be synthesized artificially in most cases, it is sufficient to describe the substance itself as fluorescent..An early observation of fluorescence was described in 1560 by Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan and in 1565 by Nicol\u00e1s Monardes in the infusion known as lignum nephriticum (Latin for \"kidney wood\").It was derived from the wood of two tree species, Pterocarpus indicus and Eysenhardtia polystachya.[1][2][3][4].", "Informal logic": "Informal logic encompasses the principles of logic and logical thought outside of a formal setting (characterized by the usage of particular statements).However, the precise definition of \"informal logic\" is a matter of some dispute.[1] Ralph H.Johnson and J.Anthony Blair define informal logic as \"a branch of logic whose task is to develop non-formal standards, criteria, procedures for the analysis, interpretation, evaluation, criticism and construction of argumentation.\"[2] This definition reflects what had been implicit in their practice and what others were doing in their informal logic texts..Informal logic is associated with informal fallacies, critical thinking, the thinking skills movement[3] and the interdisciplinary inquiry known as argumentation theory.Frans H.van Eemeren writes that the label \"informal logic\" covers a \"collection of normative approaches to the study of reasoning in ordinary language that remain closer to the practice of argumentation than formal logic.\"[4].Informal logic as a distinguished enterprise under this name emerged roughly in the late 1970s as a sub-field of philosophy.The naming of the field was preceded by the appearance of a number of textbooks that rejected the symbolic approach to logic on pedagogical grounds as inappropriate and unhelpful for introductory textbooks on logic for a general audience, for example Howard Kahane's Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric, subtitled \"The Use of Reason in Everyday Life\", first published in 1971.Kahane's textbook was described on the notice of his death in the Proceedings And Addresses of the American Philosophical Association (2002) as \"a text in informal logic, [that] was intended to enable students to cope with the misleading rhetoric one frequently finds in the media and in political discourse.It was organized around a discussion of fallacies, and was meant to be a practical instrument for dealing with the problems of everyday life.[It has] ...", "Great Depression in the United States": "In the United States, the Great Depression began with the Wall Street Crash of October 1929 and then spread worldwide.The nadir came in 1931\u20131933, and recovery came in 1940.The stock market crash marked the beginning of a decade of high unemployment, poverty, low profits, deflation, plunging farm incomes, and lost opportunities for economic growth as well as for personal advancement.Altogether, there was a general loss of confidence in the economic future.[1].The usual explanations include numerous factors, especially high consumer debt, ill-regulated markets that permitted overoptimistic loans by banks and investors, and the lack of high-growth new industries.These all interacted to create a downward economic spiral of reduced spending, falling confidence and lowered production.[2].Industries that suffered the most included construction, shipping, mining, logging, and agriculture.Also hard hit was the manufacturing of durable goods like automobiles and appliances, whose purchase consumers could postpone.The economy hit bottom in the winter of 1932\u20131933; then came four years of growth until the recession of 1937\u20131938 brought back high levels of unemployment.[3].The Depression caused major political changes in America.Three years into the depression, President Herbert Hoover, widely blamed for not doing enough to combat the crisis, lost the election of 1932 to Franklin Delano Roosevelt by a landslide.Roosevelt's economic recovery plan, the New Deal, instituted unprecedented programs for relief, recovery and reform, and brought about a major realignment of politics with liberalism dominant and conservatism in retreat until 1938..", "Turkey": "Turkey, officially the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye (Turkish: T\u00fcrkiye Cumhuriyeti [\u02c8ty\u027ecije d\u0292um\u02c8hu\u02d0\u027eijeti] \u24d8), is a country located at the juncture of Southeast Europe and West Asia.It is mainly on the Anatolian Peninsula in West Asia, with a small portion called East Thrace on the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe.It borders the Black Sea to the north; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq to the southeast; Syria and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; the Aegean Sea to the west; and Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest.Cyprus is off the south coast.Most of the country's citizens are ethnic Turks, while Kurds are the largest ethnic minority.[4] Ankara is Turkey's capital and second-largest city, while Istanbul is its largest city and economic and financial centre..One of the world's earliest permanently settled regions, present-day Turkey is home to important Neolithic sites like G\u00f6bekli Tepe and was inhabited by ancient civilizations including the Hattians, Hittites, Anatolian peoples, Greeks, Assyrians, and Persians.[11][12][13][14] Following the conquests of Alexander the Great which started the Hellenistic period, most of the ancient Anatolian regions were culturally Hellenized, and this continued during the Byzantine era.[12][15] The Seljuk Turks began migrating to Anatolia in the 11th century, which started the Turkification process.The Seljuk Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish principalities.[16] Beginning in the late 13th century, the Ottomans united the principalities and conquered the Balkans.After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1453, Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I.During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire became a global power.[11][17][18].From the late 18th century onwards, the empire's power and territory declined.[19] Mahmud II started a period of modernization in the early 19th century.[20] The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 restricted the authority of the sultan and restored the Ottoman Parliament.[21][22] The Three Pashas took control with the 1913 coup d'\u00e9tat, and the Ottoman Empire entered World War I as one of the Central Powers in 1914.During the war, the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Greek and Assyrian subjects.[23][24] After its defeat in the war, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned.[25] The Turkish War of Independence against the occupying Allied Powers resulted in the abolition of the sultanate on 1 November 1922, the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923 and the proclamation of a republic on 29 October 1923, modelled on the reforms initiated by the country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk..Turkey is a regional power with a geopolitically significant strategic location.[26][27] The economy of Turkey, which is a founding member of the OECD and G20, is classified among the E7, EAGLEs and NICs, and currently ranks 17th-largest in the world by nominal GDP and 11th-largest by PPP.", "Augusta, Georgia": "Augusta (/\u0259\u02c8\u0261\u028cst\u0259/ \u0259-GUSS-t\u0259) is a consolidated city-county on the central eastern border of the U.S.state of Georgia.The city lies directly across the Savannah River from North Augusta, South Carolina at the head of its navigable portion.Georgia's third most populous city (after Atlanta and Columbus), Augusta is located in the Fall Line section of the state..According to the U.S.Census Bureau, Augusta\u2013Richmond County had a 2020 population of 202,081,[4] not counting the unconsolidated cities of Blythe and Hephzibah.[9] It is the 116th most populous city in the United States and the 95th-largest metropolitan area.The process of consolidation between the City of Augusta and Richmond County began with a 1995 referendum in the two jurisdictions.The merger was completed on July 1, 1996.Augusta is the principal city of the Augusta metropolitan area.In 2020 it had a population of 611,000,[5] making it the second-largest metro area in the state (after Atlanta) and the ninth most populous urban center in the Deep South..Augusta was established in 1736 and is named in honor of Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha (1719\u20131772), the bride of Frederick, Prince of Wales and the mother of the British monarch George III.[1] During the American Civil War, Augusta housed the principal Confederate Powderworks.[10] Augusta's warm climate made it a major resort town of the Eastern United States in the early and mid-20th century.Internationally, Augusta is best known for hosting The Masters golf tournament each spring.", "Chicago Blackhawks": "The Chicago Blackhawks (spelled Black Hawks until 1986, and known colloquially as the Hawks) are a professional ice hockey team based in Chicago.The Blackhawks compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference and have won six Stanley Cup championships since their founding in 1926.They are one of the \"Original Six\" NHL teams, along with the Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers.Since 1995, the team has played their home games at the United Center, which they share with the National Basketball Association's Chicago Bulls; both teams previously played at the now-demolished Chicago Stadium.[5].The Blackhawks' original owner was Frederic McLaughlin, a \"hands-on\" owner who fired many coaches during his ownership and led the team to win two Stanley Cup titles in 1934 and 1938, respectively.After McLaughlin's death in 1944, the team came under the ownership of the Norris family, who acted as their landlord as owners of the Chicago Stadium, and also owned stakes in several of the NHL teams.At first, the Norris ownership was as part of a syndicate fronted by longtime executive Bill Tobin, and the team languished in favor of the Norris-owned Detroit Red Wings.After the senior James E.Norris died in 1952, the Norris assets were spread among family members, and James D.Norris became the owner of the Blackhawks.The younger Norris took an active interest in the team, which won another Stanley Cup title under his ownership in 1961.After James D.", "Lent": "Lent (Latin: Quadragesima,[1] 'Fortieth') is the solemn Christian religious observance in the liturgical year commemorating the 40 days Jesus Christ spent fasting in the desert and enduring temptation by Satan, according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, before beginning his public ministry.[2][3] Lent is observed in the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, Moravian, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, United Protestant and Roman Catholic traditions of Christianity.[4][5] Some Anabaptist, Baptist, Reformed (including certain Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches), and nondenominational Christian churches also observe Lent, although many churches in these traditions do not.[6][7][8][9][10][11].Which days are enumerated as being part of Lent differs between denominations (see below), although in all of them Lent is described as lasting for a total duration of 40 days, the number of days Jesus, as well as Moses and Elijah, went without food in their respective fasts.[12][13][14] In Lent-observing Western Churches, Lent begins on Ash Wednesday and ends approximately six weeks later; depending on the Christian denomination and local custom, Lent concludes either on the evening of Maundy Thursday,[15] or at sundown on Holy Saturday, when the Easter Vigil is celebrated,[16] though in either case, Lenten fasting observances are maintained until the evening of Holy Saturday.[17] Sundays may or may not be excluded, depending on the denomination.In Eastern Christianity \u2013 including Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholics, Eastern Lutherans, and Oriental Orthodox \u2013 Lent is observed continuously without interruption for 40 days starting on Clean Monday and ending on Lazarus Saturday before Holy Week.[18][19].Lent is a period of grief that necessarily ends with a great celebration of Easter.Thus, it is known in Eastern Orthodox circles as the season of \"bright sadness\" (Greek: \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03b7, romanized:charmolyp\u00ea).[20] The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer for Easter through prayer, mortifying the flesh, repentance of sins, almsgiving, simple living, and self-denial.[21] In Lent, many Christians commit to fasting, as well as giving up certain luxuries in imitation of Jesus Christ's sacrifice during his journey into the desert for 40 days;[22][23][24] this is known as one's Lenten sacrifice.[25].Many Lent-observing Christians also add a Lenten spiritual discipline, such as reading a daily devotional or praying through a Lenten calendar, to draw themselves near to God.[26][27] Often observed are the Stations of the Cross, a devotional commemoration of Christ's carrying the Cross and crucifixion.Many churches remove flowers from their altars and veil crucifixes, religious statues that show the triumphant Christ, and other elaborate religious symbols in violet fabrics in solemn observance of the event.The custom of veiling is typically practiced the last two weeks, beginning on the Sunday Judica which is therefore in the vernacular called Passion Sunday until Good Friday, when the cross is unveiled solemnly in the liturgy..In most Lent-observing denominations, the last week of Lent coincides with Holy Week, starting with Palm Sunday.Following the New Testament narrative, Jesus' crucifixion is commemorated on Good Friday, and at the beginning of the next week the joyful celebration of Easter Sunday, the start of the Easter season, which recalls the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.In some Christian denominations, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday form the Easter Triduum.[28].The English word Lent is a shortened form of the Old English word lencten, meaning \"spring season\", as its Dutch language cognate lente (Old Dutch lentin)[30] still does today.", "Chernobyl disaster": "The Chernobyl disaster[a] began on 26 April 1986 with the explosion of the No.4 reactor of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR, close to the border with the Byelorussian SSR, in the Soviet Union.[1] It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven\u2014the maximum severity\u2014on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.The initial emergency response and subsequent mitigation efforts involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18billion roubles\u2014roughly US$68billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation.[2] It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history.[3][4][5].The accident occurred during a test of the steam turbine's ability to power the emergency feedwater pumps in the event of a simultaneous loss of external power and coolant pipe rupture.Following an accidental drop in reactor power to near-zero, the operators restarted the reactor in preparation for the turbine test with a prohibited control rod configuration.Upon successful completion of the test, the reactor was then shut down for maintenance.Due to a variety of factors, this action resulted in a power surge at the base of the reactor which brought about the rupture of reactor components and the loss of coolant.This process led to steam explosions and a meltdown, which destroyed the containment building.This was followed by a reactor core fire which lasted until 4 May 1986, during which airborne radioactive contaminants were spread throughout the USSR and Europe.[6][7] In response to the initial accident, a 10-kilometre (6.2mi) radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident, from which approximately 49,000 people were evacuated, primarily from Pripyat.The exclusion zone was later increased to a radius of 30 kilometres (19mi), from which an additional ~68,000 people were evacuated.[8].Following the reactor explosion, which killed two engineers and severely burned two more, an emergency operation to put out the fires and stabilize the surviving reactor began, during which 237 workers were hospitalized, of which 134 exhibited symptoms of acute radiation syndrome (ARS).Among those hospitalized, 28 died within the following three months.In the following 10 years, 14 more workers (9 of whom had been hospitalized with ARS) died of various causes mostly unrelated to radiation exposure.[9] 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were attributed to the disaster as of 2011[update].[10][11] A United Nations committee found that to date fewer than 100 deaths have resulted from the fallout.[12] Model predictions of the eventual total death toll in the coming decades vary.", "Subject complement": "In grammatical terminology, a subject complement is a predicative expression that follows a linking verb (copula) and that complements the subject of a clause by either renaming or describing it.It completes the meaning of the subject.[1] In the former case, a renaming noun phrase such as a noun or pronoun is called a predicative nominal.An adjective following the copula and describing the subject is called a predicative adjective.In either case the predicative complement in effect mirrors the subject.Subject complements are used with a small class of verbs called linking verbs or copulas, of which be is the most common.Since linking verbs are intransitive, subject complements are not affected by any action of the verb.Subject complements are typically neither clause arguments nor adjuncts.A predicative complement can be either a subject complement or an object complement..A subject complement does not determine the verb.When there is a difference between the number, the verb agrees with the subject.[2][3].The subject complement is bold in the following examples:.Here, was is a linking verb (an inflected form of be) that equates the subject complement phrase a tranquil pool, with the head noun, pool, to the subject, the lake (with head noun lake)..", "Grammy Award records": "Throughout the history of the Grammy Awards, many significant records have been set.This page only includes the competitive awards which have been won by various artists.This does not include the various special awards that are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences such as Lifetime Achievement Awards, Trustees Awards, Technical Awards or Legend Awards.The page however does include other non-performance related Grammys (known as the Craft & Production Fields) that may have been presented to the artist(s)..The record for the most Grammy Awards won in a lifetime is held by Beyonc\u00e9, an American singer, songwriter, record producer and dancer, who has won 32.It was previously held by Georg Solti, a Hungarian-British conductor, who won 31..Beyonc\u00e9 has won 32 Grammy Awards..Georg Solti has won 31 Grammy Awards..U2 holds the record for most Grammy Awards won by a group.They have won 22 awards..Quincy Jones holds the record for most Grammy Awards won by a producer, with 28 awards.Eleven of these were awarded for production duties; Jones has also received Grammys as an arranger and a performing artist.", "Eminem": "Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (/\u02cc\u025bm\u026a\u02c8n\u025bm/; often stylized as EMIN\u018eM), is an American rapper.He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is frequently mentioned among the greatest rappers of all time.[3] Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music.While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as an influence by and upon many artists working in various genres..After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr.Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP.His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction.[4] He returned to the music industry four years later with the release of Relapse (2009) and Recovery, which was released the following year.Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's second album, after The Eminem Show in 2002, to be the best-selling album of the year worldwide.In the following years, he released the US number one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), and Music to Be Murdered By (2020)..Eminem's songs include \"My Name Is\", \"The Real Slim Shady\", \"The Way I Am\", \"Stan\", \"Without Me\", \"Lose Yourself\", \"Mockingbird\", \"Not Afraid\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", \"The Monster\", \"River\", \"Godzilla\", and \"Rap God\".In addition to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group D12.He is also known for collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9\"; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil..", "Conservation of mass": "In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy, the mass of the system must remain constant over time, as the system's mass cannot change, so the quantity can neither be added nor be removed.Therefore, the quantity of mass is conserved over time.[1].The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form.For example, in chemical reactions, the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction.Thus, during any chemical reaction and low-energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants, or starting materials, must be equal to the mass of the products..The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry, mechanics, and fluid dynamics.Historically, mass conservation in chemical reactions was primarily demonstrated in the 17th century[2] and finally confirmed by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century.The formulation of this law was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry..In reality, the conservation of mass only holds approximately and is considered part of a series of assumptions in classical mechanics.The law has to be modified to comply with the laws of quantum mechanics and special relativity under the principle of mass\u2013energy equivalence, which states that energy and mass form one conserved quantity.For very energetic systems the conservation of mass only is shown not to hold, as is the case in nuclear reactions and particle-antiparticle annihilation in particle physics..Mass is also not generally conserved in open systems.", "Pig": "The pig (Sus domesticus), often called swine (pl.: swine), hog, or domestic pig when distinguishing from other members of the genus Sus, is an omnivorous, domesticated, even-toed, hoofed mammal.It is variously considered a subspecies of Sus scrofa (the wild boar or Eurasian boar) or a distinct species.The pig's head-plus-body length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8m (3 to 6ft), and adult pigs typically weigh between 50 and 350kg (110 and 770lb), with well-fed individuals even exceeding this range.The size and weight of hogs largely depends on their breed.Compared to other artiodactyls, a pig's head is relatively long and pointed.Most even-toed ungulates are herbivorous, but pigs are omnivores, like their wild relative.Pigs grunt and make snorting sounds..When used as livestock, pigs are farmed primarily for the production of meat, called pork.A group of pigs is called a passel, a team, or a sounder.The animal's bones, hide, and bristles are also used in products.Pigs, especially miniature breeds, are kept as pets..The pig typically has a large head, with a long snout which is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and a disk of cartilage at the tip.[2] The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food and is a very acute sense organ.", "Floppy disk": "A floppy disk or floppy diskette (casually referred to as a floppy or a diskette) is a type of disk storage composed of a thin and flexible disk of a magnetic storage medium in a square or nearly square plastic enclosure lined with a fabric that removes dust particles from the spinning disk.Floppy disks store digital data which can be read and written when the disk is inserted into a floppy disk drive (FDD) connected to or inside a computer or other device..The first floppy disks, invented and made by IBM, had a disk diameter of 8 inches (203.2mm).[1] Subsequently, the 5\u00bc-inch and then the 3\u00bd-inch became a ubiquitous form of data storage and transfer into the first years of the 21st century.[2] 3\u00bd-inch floppy disks can still be used with an external USB floppy disk drive.USB drives for 5\u00bc-inch, 8-inch, and other-size floppy disks are rare to non-existent.Some individuals and organizations continue to use older equipment to read or transfer data from floppy disks..Floppy disks were so common in late 20th-century culture that many electronic and software programs continue to use save icons that look like floppy disks well into the 21st century, as a form of skeuomorphic design.While floppy disk drives still have some limited uses, especially with legacy industrial computer equipment, they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater data storage capacity and data transfer speed, such as USB flash drives, memory cards, optical discs, and storage available through local computer networks and cloud storage..The first commercial floppy disks, developed in the late 1960s, were 8 inches (203.2mm) in diameter;[1][2] they became commercially available in 1971 as a component of IBM products and both drives and disks were then sold separately starting in 1972 by Memorex and others.[3] These disks and associated drives were produced and improved upon by IBM and other companies such as Memorex, Shugart Associates, and Burroughs Corporation.[4] The term \"floppy disk\" appeared in print as early as 1970,[5] and although IBM announced its first media as the Type 1 Diskette in 1973, the industry continued to use the terms \"floppy disk\" or \"floppy\"..In 1976, Shugart Associates introduced the 5\u00bc-inch FDD.By 1978, there were more than ten manufacturers producing such FDDs.[6] There were competing floppy disk formats, with hard- and soft-sector versions and encoding schemes such as differential Manchester encoding (DM), modified frequency modulation (MFM), M2FM and group coded recording (GCR).The 5\u00bc-inch format displaced the 8-inch one for most uses, and the hard-sectored disk format disappeared.The most common capacity of the 5\u00bc-inch format in DOS-based PCs was 360KB (368,640 bytes) for the Double-Sided Double-Density (DSDD) format using MFM encoding.", "Cutter (baseball)": "In baseball, a cut fastball or cutter is a type of fastball that breaks toward the pitcher's glove-hand side, as it reaches home plate.[1] This pitch is somewhere between a slider and a four-seam fastball, as it is usually thrown faster than a slider but with more movement than a typical fastball.[1] Some pitchers use a cutter to prevent hitters from expecting their regular fastballs.A common technique for throwing a cutter is to use a four-seam fastball grip with the baseball set slightly off center in the hand.[2] A batter hitting a cutter pitch often achieves only soft contact and an easy out due to the pitch's movement keeping the ball away from the bat's sweet spot.The cutter is typically 2\u20135mph slower than a pitcher's four-seam fastball.In 2010, the average pitch classified as a cutter by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6mph; the average two-seamer was 90.97mph.[3].The New York Yankees' former closer Mariano Rivera, one of the foremost practitioners of the cutter,[1] made the pitch famous after the mid-1990s, though the pitch itself has been around since at least the 1950s.[4].When the cut fastball is pitched skillfully at speed, particularly against the opposite hand batter (that is, a right-handed pitcher facing a left-handed hitter), the pitch can crack and split a hitter's bat, hence the pitch's occasional nickname of \"the buzzsaw\".Batter Ryan Klesko, then of the Atlanta Braves, broke three bats in a single plate appearance during the 1999 World Series while facing Rivera.To deal with this problem a few switch hitters batted right-handed against the right-handed Rivera\u2014that is, on the \"wrong\" side, as switch hitters generally bat from the same side of the plate as the pitcher's glove hand.[5].In 2011, Dan Haren led all major league starting pitchers with nearly 48% of his pitches classified by PITCHf/x as cutters.Roy Halladay was close behind at 45%.[6] Other pitchers who rely (or relied) heavily on a cut fastball include Jon Lester, James Shields, Josh Tomlin, Will Harris, Mark Melancon, Jaime Garcia, Wade Miley, David Robertson, Jerry Reuss, Andy Pettitte, and Corbin Burnes.[7][8][9] Over the course of Kenley Jansen's career from (2010\u2013present)[10] he has thrown his cutter 85.1% of the time, second only to Rivera at 87.2% among pitchers with at least 30 innings during that time period.[11].The cutter grew in popularity as certain pitchers, including  Dan Haren, looked to compensate for loss of speed in their four-seam fastball.[1] Braves third baseman Chipper Jones attributed the increased dominance of pitchers from 2010\u20132011 to a more prolific use of the cutter, as did Cleveland Indians pitcher Chris Perez.[12][13] By 2011, it was commonly being called the \"pitch du jour\" in the baseball press.[7][14].Some pushback has developed against (overuse of) the pitch, due to concerns that a pitcher overusing the cutter could develop arm fatigue.[15] Baltimore Orioles General Manager Dan Duquette instructed prized prospect Dylan Bundy not to throw the pitch in the minor leagues, believing its use could make Bundy's fastball and curve less effective.[16].", "What It Takes (song)": "\"What It Takes\" is a power ballad[4] by American rock band Aerosmith.Written by Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Desmond Child,[5] it was released in 1989 as the third single from the critically and commercially successful 1989 album Pump.\"I'll put some ballads on an album,\" Tyler remarked, \"if that's what it takes so that some young kid can get to hear a 'Young Lust' or 'F.I.N.E.*'.\"[6][7].Child had co-written the power ballad \"Angel\" for Aerosmith's previous album, but the band wanted to make sure that its own identity was reflected in \"What It Takes.\" According to Perry \"It started off sounding really county-western.We didn't want to write a song like 'Angel,' and for Desmond, that's where his heart and soul is.He's into big, dramatic ballads.But we wanted to do something different.\"  Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford stated that \"It was a keyboard song to begin with.Somewhere along the line we knew it was special, so it had to be approached in a different manner.\"  Perry went on to say that \"The thing that made it for me was when [Fairbairn] put an accordion on it.That gave it the flavor it needed.Otherwise it would have just been nice chords and nice changes.\"[8].The lyrics to \"What It Takes\" are about getting over a past relationship and the resulting hurt feelings.[8] Lyrics in the song reference two other Aerosmith songs: F.I.N.E.*, also featured on the Pump album; and \"Heart's Done Time\", featured on the band's previous album, Permanent Vacation..There are two videos for the song.", "Odysseus": "In Greek and Roman mythology, Odysseus (/\u0259\u02c8d\u026asi\u0259s/ \u0259-DISS-ee-\u0259s;[1] Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2, \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2, translit.Odysse\u00fas, Odyse\u00fas, IPA: [o.dy(s).s\u011bu\u032fs]), also known by the Latin variant Ulysses (/ju\u02d0\u02c8l\u026asi\u02d0z/ yoo-LISS-eez, UK also /\u02c8ju\u02d0l\u026asi\u02d0z/ YOO-liss-eez; Latin: Ulysses, Ulixes), is a legendary Greek king of Ithaca and the hero of Homer's epic poem the Odyssey.Odysseus also plays a key role in Homer's Iliad and other works in that same epic cycle.[2].Son of La\u00ebrtes and Anticlea, husband of Penelope, and father of Telemachus, Acusilaus, and Telegonus[3] Odysseus is renowned for his intellectual brilliance, guile, and versatility (polytropos), and is thus known by the epithet Odysseus the Cunning (Greek: \u03bc\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, translit.m\u00eatis, lit.\"cunning intelligence\"[4]).He is most famous for his nostos, or \"homecoming\", which took him ten eventful years after the decade-long Trojan War..The form \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3(\u03c3)\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 Odys(s)eus is used starting in the epic period and through the classical period, but various other forms are also found.In vase inscriptions, we find the variants Oliseus (\u1f48\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), Olyseus (\u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), Olysseus (\u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), Olyteus (\u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), Olytteus (\u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2) and \u014clysseus (\u1f68\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2).The form Oulix\u0113s (\u039f\u1f50\u03bb\u03af\u03be\u03b7\u03c2) is attested in an early source in Magna Graecia (Ibycus, according to Diomedes Grammaticus), while the Greek grammarian Aelius Herodianus has Oulixeus (\u039f\u1f50\u03bb\u03b9\u03be\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2).[5] In Latin, he was known as Ulix\u0113s or (considered less correct) Ulyss\u0113s.Some have supposed that \"there may originally have been two separate figures, one called something like Odysseus, the other something like Ulixes, who were combined into one complex personality.\"[6] However, the change between d and l is common also in some Indo-European and Greek names,[7] and the Latin form is supposed to be derived from the Etruscan Uthuze (see below), which perhaps accounts for some of the phonetic innovations..The etymology of the name is unknown.Ancient authors linked the name to the Greek verbs odussomai (\u1f40\u03b4\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) \"to be wroth against, to hate\",[8] to oduromai (\u1f40\u03b4\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9) \"to lament, bewail\",[9][10] or even to ollumi (\u1f44\u03bb\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9) \"to perish, to be lost\".[11][12] Homer relates it to various forms of this verb in references and puns.In Book 19 of the Odyssey, where Odysseus' early childhood is recounted, Euryclea asks the boy's grandfather Autolycus to name him.Euryclea seems to suggest a name like Polyaretos, \"for he has much been prayed for\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2)  but Autolycus \"apparently in a sardonic mood\" decided to give the child another name commemorative of \"his own experience in life\":[13] \"Since I have been angered (\u1f40\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 odyssamenos) with many, both men and women, let the name of the child be Odysseus\".[14] Odysseus often receives the patronymic epithet Laertiades (\u039b\u03b1\u03b5\u03c1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2), \"son of La\u00ebrtes\"..", "Erie, Colorado": "The Town of Erie is a Statutory Town located in Weld and Boulder counties, Colorado, United States.[1] The town population was 30,038 at the 2020 United States Census, a +65.64% increase since the 2010 United States Census.[4] At the 2020 census, 17,387 (58%) Erie residents lived in Weld County and 12,651 (42%) lived in Boulder County.Erie is a part of the Denver-Aurora, CO Combined Statistical Area and the Front Range Urban Corridor..Erie is located just west of Interstate 25, with easy access to Interstate 70, Denver International Airport and Colorado's entire Front Range.Erie's Planning Area spans 48 square miles (120km2), extending from the north side of State Highway 52 south to State Highway 7, and between US 287 on the west and Interstate 25 to the east.[7] Erie is approximately 35 minutes from Denver International Airport, 25 minutes from Denver and 20 minutes from Boulder..The town was named after Erie, Pennsylvania, the former home of early settler Richard Van Valkenburg.[8].Although it was settled and named in 1867, Erie was not officially incorporated until November 16, 1874.[9] The first board of trustees consisted of five permanent and prominent members of the community; George Meller, Richard Van Valkenburg, John T.Williams, Joseph J.Wharton and John A.Rowe.[10] Erie was unique among local coal mining towns because the local coal miners actually owned land or houses in town, instead of setting up temporary camps.[10].Coal was discovered in the region in the 1860s, and by 1870, railway service was established by the Denver-Pacific Spur Railroad.In 1871, the Denver & Boulder Valley Railroad was built through the area, connecting Boulder and Brighton.[9] The railroad made it much easier to transport coal to the surrounding communities and to Denver, helping the town grow quickly.[11] Although the locals were mining coal in the surrounding area starting in the 1860s, the first official mine in Erie opened in 1876; operated by Ira Austin.[10].The first school was established in 1874, with 33 students enrolling.[9] The first school building was erected in 1881, with 100 students enrolled.", "PlayStation 3": "The PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Interactive Entertainment.The successor to the PlayStation 2, it is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles.It was first released on November 11, 2006, in Japan,[10] November 17, 2006, in North America, and March 23, 2007, in Europe and Australia.[11][12][13] The PlayStation 3 competed primarily against Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles..The console was first officially announced at E3 2005, and was released at the end of 2006.It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc technology as its primary storage medium.[14] The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, including the PlayStation Network, as well as the first to be controllable from a handheld console, through its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita.[15][16][17] In September 2009, the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released.It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games.It was lighter and thinner than the original version, and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a minor start-up change in software.A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012, further refining and redesigning the console..During its early years, the system received a mixed reception, due to its high price ($599 for a 60-gigabyte model, $499 for a 20GB model), a complex processor architecture, and lack of quality games but was praised for its Blu-ray capabilities and \"untapped potential\".The reception would get more positive over time.The system had a slow start in the market[18] but managed to recover, particularly after the introduction of the Slim model.Its successor, the PlayStation 4, was released later in November 2013.", "Salvador Dal\u00c3\u00ad": "Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dal\u00ed i Dom\u00e8nech, Marquess of Dal\u00ed of P\u00fabol[a] gcYC (11 May 1904\u2013 23 January 1989), known as Salvador Dal\u00ed (/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0li, d\u0251\u02d0\u02c8li\u02d0/ DAH-lee, dah-LEE,[1] Catalan: [s\u0259l\u03b2\u0259\u02c8\u00f0o \u00f0\u0259\u02c8li], Spanish: [sal\u03b2a\u02c8\u00f0o\u027e \u00f0a\u02c8li]),[b] was a Spanish surrealist artist renowned for his technical skill, precise draftsmanship, and the striking and bizarre images in his work..Born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain, Dal\u00ed received his formal education in fine arts in Madrid.Influenced by Impressionism and the Renaissance masters from a young age he became increasingly attracted to Cubism and avant-garde movements.[2] He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents.His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings.Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the Spanish Civil War (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success.He returned to Spain in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism, and recent scientific developments.[3].Dal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists.He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism.Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships.To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior often drew more attention than his artwork.[4][5] His public support for the Francoist regime, his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.[6] His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, pop art and contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst.[7][8].There are two major museums devoted to Salvador Dal\u00ed's work: the Dal\u00ed Theatre-Museum in Figueres, Spain, and the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum in St.Petersburg, Florida..", "Humanities": "Humanities are academic disciplines that study aspects of human society and culture, including the fundamental questions asked by humans.During the Renaissance, the term 'humanities' referred to the study of classical literature and language, as opposed to the study of religion or 'divinity.' The study of the humanities was a key part of the secular curriculum in universities at the time.Today, the humanities are more frequently defined as any fields of study outside of natural sciences, social sciences, formal sciences (like mathematics), and applied sciences (or professional training).[1] They use methods that are primarily critical, or speculative, and have a significant historical element[2]\u2014as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of science.[2].The humanities include the studies of foreign languages, history, philosophy, language arts (literature, writing, oratory, rhetoric, poetry, etc.), performing arts (theater, music, dance, etc.), and visual arts (painting, sculpture, photography, filmmaking, etc.)..Some definitions of the humanities encompass law and religion due to their shared characteristics, such as the study of language and culture.[3]However, these definitions are not universally accepted, as law and religion are often considered professional subjects rather than humanities subjects.Professional subjects, like some social sciences, are sometimes classified as being part of both the liberal arts and professional development education, whereas humanities subjects are generally confined to the traditional liberal arts education.Although anthropology, archaeology, linguistics, psychology, and sociology share some similarities with the humanities, these are widely considered social sciences.Similarly, disciplines such as finance, business administration, political science, economics, and global studies have closer ties to the social sciences rather than the humanities..Scholars in the humanities are called humanities scholars or sometimes humanists.[4] The term humanist also describes the philosophical position of humanism, which antihumanist scholars in the humanities reject.Renaissance scholars and artists are also known as humanists.Some secondary schools offer humanities classes usually consisting of literature, history, foreign language, and art..Human disciplines like history and language mainly use the comparative method[5] and comparative research.", "White House Christmas tree": "The White House Christmas Tree, also known as the Blue Room Christmas Tree, is the official indoor Christmas tree at the residence of the president of the United States, the White House.The first indoor Christmas tree was installed in the White House sometime in the 19th century (there are varying claims as to the exact year) and since 1961 the tree has had a themed motif at the discretion of the First Lady of the United States..There are two claims to the \"first\" genuine White House Christmas tree.President Franklin Pierce is said to have had the first indoor Christmas tree at the White House during the 1850s,[1] variously reported as 1853[2] or 1856.[3] More credible sources state that it was, in fact, President Benjamin Harrison's who had the first indoor tree (either in 1888,[4] 1889,[5][6] or 1891[1]).First Lady Caroline Harrison helped decorate the tree, which was installed in the second floor oval parlor, today's Yellow Oval Room.[5] There is an 1880 reference to President John Tyler in the 1840s, hosting a children's party at which there was a Christmas tree with gifts.[7].Following the Harrison administration indoor trees were not always used at the White House.First Lady Lou Henry Hoover began the tradition of presidential wives decorating the White House tree with the first \"official\" White House Christmas tree in 1929.[5] In 1961, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy began the tradition of selecting a theme for the White House Christmas tree by decorating with a Nutcracker motif.[8].As stated, there were years where no indoor White House Christmas tree was installed at all.It is verifiable that there was no Christmas tree in the White House in 1902,[9] 1904,[10] 1907,[11] and 1922.[12] The lack of a tree in 1902 was due to the fact that President Theodore Roosevelt had not ordered one by December 23.[9].Additionally, other presidents never displayed a tree in the White House.First U.S.President George Washington held office at a time when there was no White House, thus it is impossible for him to have displayed a tree there.[13] There is no evidence that Abraham Lincoln ever displayed a Christmas tree in the White House.[14] In 1922, First Lady Florence Harding's illness led to a more subdued Christmas celebration at the White House and no Christmas tree.[12].", "President of the United States": "The president of the United States (POTUS)[A] is the head of state/head of government of the United States of America.The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces..The power of the presidency has grown substantially[11] since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789.[6] While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D.Roosevelt and George W.Bush.[12][13] In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower.[14][15][16][17] As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power..Article II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president.The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S.foreign policy.The role includes responsibility for directing the world's most expensive military, which has the second-largest nuclear arsenal..The president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking.As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation.", "sense": "A sense is a biological system used by an organism for sensation, the process of gathering information about the world through the detection of stimuli.Although in some cultures five human senses were traditionally identified as such (namely sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing), many more are now recognized.[1] Senses used by non-human organisms are even greater in variety and number.During sensation, sense organs collect various stimuli (such as a sound or smell) for transduction, meaning transformation into a form that can be understood by the brain.Sensation and perception are fundamental to nearly every aspect of an organism's cognition, behavior and thought..In organisms, a sensory organ consists of a group of interrelated sensory cells that respond to a specific type of physical stimulus.Via cranial and spinal nerves (nerves of the Central and Peripheral nervous systems that relay sensory information to and from the brain and body), the different types of sensory receptor cells (such as mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors, chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors) in sensory organs transduct sensory information from these organs towards the central nervous system, finally arriving at the sensory cortices in the brain, where sensory signals are processed and interpreted (perceived)..Sensory systems, or senses, are often divided into external (exteroception) and internal (interoception) sensory systems.Human external senses are based on the sensory organs of the eyes, ears, skin, nose, and mouth.Internal sensation detects stimuli from internal organs and tissues.Internal senses possessed by humans include the vestibular system (sense of balance) sensed by the inner ear, as well as others such as spatial orientation, proprioception (body position) and nociception (pain).Further internal senses lead to signals such as hunger, thirst, suffocation, and nausea, or different involuntary behaviors, such as vomiting.[2][3][4] Some animals are able to detect electrical and magnetic fields, air moisture, or polarized light, while others sense and perceive through alternative systems, such as echolocation.Sensory modalities or sub modalities are different ways sensory information is encoded or transduced.", "Spider": "See Spider taxonomy..Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs, chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom,[2] and spinnerets that extrude silk.[3] They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms.[4][5] Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every land habitat.As of August2022[update], 50,356 spider species in 132 families have been recorded by taxonomists.[1] However, there has been debate among scientists about how families should be classified, with over 20 different classifications proposed since 1900.[6].Anatomically, spiders (as with all arachnids) differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax or prosoma, and the opisthosoma, or abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel.However, as there is currently neither paleontological nor embryological evidence that spiders ever had a separate thorax-like division, there exists an argument against the validity of the term cephalothorax, which means fused cephalon (head) and the thorax.Similarly, arguments can be formed against use of the term abdomen, as the opisthosoma of all spiders contains a heart and respiratory organs, organs atypical of an abdomen.[7].Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae.In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax.Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure..Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of glands.Spider webs vary widely in size, shape and the amount of sticky thread used.It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms, and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-weaver spiders.", "Grey's Anatomy": "Grey's Anatomy is an American medical drama television series focusing on the personal and professional lives of surgical interns, residents, and attendings at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital.The series premiered on March 27, 2005, on ABC as a mid-season replacement.The show's title is an allusion to Gray's Anatomy, a classic human anatomy textbook.[1] Writer Shonda Rhimes developed the pilot and served as showrunner, head writer, and executive producer until stepping down in 2015.[2][bettersourceneeded] The series is filmed primarily in Los Angeles, California, and Vancouver, British Columbia..The original cast consisted of nine star-billed actors: Ellen Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, T.R.Knight, Chandra Wilson, James Pickens Jr., Isaiah Washington, and Patrick Dempsey.For most of its run, the series revolves around Dr.Meredith Grey (Pompeo), chronicling her progression from surgical intern to fully-qualified doctor to the hospital's chief of general surgery.The cast has undergone major changes throughout the series' run, with only three original members remaining by the 19th season \u2013 Pompeo, Wilson, and Pickens.Pompeo stepped back from the series in its 19th season, at which point the show shifted to more of an ensemble format.As of February13, 2023[update], the show has been picked up for a 20th season.Grey's Anatomy has two spin-off series: Private Practice (2007\u20132013) and Station 19 (2018\u2013present)..", "Schizophrenia": "Schizophrenia is a mental disorder[14] characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis.[5] Major symptoms include hallucinations (typically hearing voices), delusions and disorganized thinking.[7] Other symptoms include social withdrawal and flat affect.[5] Symptoms typically develop gradually, begin during young adulthood, and in many cases are never resolved.[3][7] There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a psychiatric history that includes the person's reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person.[7] For a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the described symptoms need to have been present for at least six months (according to the DSM-5) or one month (according to the ICD-11).[7][15] Many people with schizophrenia have other mental disorders, especially substance use disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder.[7].About 0.3% to 0.7% of people are diagnosed with schizophrenia during their lifetime.[16] In 2017, there were an estimated 1.1million new cases and in 2022 a total of 24 million cases globally.[2][17] Males are more often affected and on average have an earlier onset than females.[2] The causes of schizophrenia may include genetic and environmental factors.[5] Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants.[18] Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, childhood adversity, cannabis use during adolescence, infections, the age of a person's mother or father, and poor nutrition during pregnancy.[5][19].About half of those diagnosed with schizophrenia will have a significant improvement over the long term with no further relapses, and a small proportion of these will recover completely.[7][20] The other half will have a lifelong impairment.[21] In severe cases, people may be admitted to hospitals.[20] Social problems such as long-term unemployment, poverty, homelessness, exploitation and victimization are commonly correlated with schizophrenia.[22][23] Compared to the general population, people with schizophrenia have a higher suicide rate (about 5% overall) and more physical health problems,[24][25] leading to an average decrease in life expectancy by 20[10] to 28 years.[11] In 2015, an estimated 17,000 deaths were linked to schizophrenia.[13].The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counseling, job training and social rehabilitation.[5] Up to a third of people do not respond to initial antipsychotics, in which case clozapine may be used.[26] In a network comparative meta-analysis of 15 antipsychotic drugs, clozapine was significantly more effective than all other drugs, although clozapine's heavily multimodal action may cause more side effects.[27] In situations where doctors judge that there is a risk of harm to self or others, they may impose short involuntary hospitalization.[28] Long-term hospitalization is used on a small number of people with severe schizophrenia.[29] In some countries where supportive services are limited or unavailable, long-term hospital stays are more common.[30].Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood and behavior.[31] Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms.[3][32] The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms.These may be present in any of the different psychoses and are often transient, making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic.Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).[33][34].Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia.They include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts and speech, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[33] Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia[35] and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices), but can sometimes involve any of the other senses of taste, sight, smell and touch.[36] The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense.[35] They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[37] Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature.Distortions of self-experience such as feeling as others can hear one's thoughts to believing that thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[38] Thought disorders can include thought blocking and disorganized speech.[3] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication[5] and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps linked to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.[7].Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes.The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect \u2013 showing flat expressions (monotone) or little emotion; alogia \u2013 a poverty of speech; anhedonia \u2013 an inability to feel pleasure; asociality \u2013 the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition \u2013 a lack of motivation and apathy.[39][40] Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing.[41][42] Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine.[42] It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression.[39][43] Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia.[44] Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.[45].", "Paul Snider": "Paul Leslie Snider (April 15, 1951 \u2013 August 14, 1980) was a Canadian nightclub promoter and pimp who murdered his estranged wife, Playboy model and actress Dorothy Stratten.Following her murder, Snider killed himself.[1][2].Snider was born in Vancouver.By the mid-1970s, he was a nightclub promoter and pimp.[1] In 1977, he met Dorothy Stratten at a Vancouver-area Dairy Queen, where she was working part-time while still attending high school.In 1979, Snider sent professionally taken nude photographs of Stratten to Playboy magazine and she was chosen as a Playmate for the month of August that year.Snider and Stratten moved to Los Angeles and married on June 1 in Las Vegas.[3].While Stratten worked as a \"bunny\" at the Century City Playboy Club, and was cast in a few television and film roles, Snider had engaged in numerous get-rich-quick schemes, including building and selling exercise benches.Stratten helped support Snider financially throughout their short marriage..In 1980, Stratten was named Playboy's Playmate of the Year and was cast in the movie They All Laughed (1981) directed by Peter Bogdanovich, with whom she began an affair.Stratten and Snider separated and he hired a private investigator to follow her..On August 14, 1980, Dorothy Stratten was shot and killed in the West Los Angeles house she had shared with Snider, whose body was found next to hers.Police believed Snider raped and murdered Stratten, and then killed himself with the same shotgun.[1][4].", "Epic of Gilgamesh": "The Epic of Gilgamesh (/\u02c8\u0261\u026al\u0261\u0259m\u025b\u0283/)[2] is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia.The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five Sumerian poems about Bilgamesh (Sumerian for \"Gilgamesh\"), king of Uruk, dating from the Third Dynasty of Ur (c.\u20092100 BC).[1] These independent stories were later used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian.The first surviving version of this combined epic, known as the \"Old Babylonian\" version, dates back to the 18th century BC and is titled after its incipit, Sh\u016btur eli sharr\u012b (\"Surpassing All Other Kings\").Only a few tablets of it have survived.The later Standard Babylonian version compiled by S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba \u012bmuru[note 1] (\"He who Saw the Abyss\", lit.\u2009'\"He who Sees the Unknown\"').Approximately two-thirds of this longer, twelve-tablet version have been recovered.Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal..The first half of the story discusses Gilgamesh (who was king of Uruk) and Enkidu, a wild man created by the gods to stop Gilgamesh from oppressing the people of Uruk.After Enkidu becomes civilized through sexual initiation with Shamhat, he travels to Uruk, where he challenges Gilgamesh to a test of strength.Gilgamesh wins the contest; nonetheless, the two become friends.Together, they make a six-day journey to the legendary Cedar Forest, where they plan to slay the Guardian, Humbaba the Terrible, and cut down the sacred Cedar.[4] The goddess Ishtar sends the Bull of Heaven to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances.Gilgamesh and Enkidu kill the Bull of Heaven after which the gods decide to sentence Enkidu to death and kill him..", "Eukaryote": "The eukaryotes (/ju\u02d0\u02c8k\u00e6rio\u028ats, -\u0259ts/) constitute the domain of Eukarya, organisms whose cells have a membrane-bound nucleus.All animals, plants, fungi, and many unicellular organisms are eukaryotes.They constitute a major group of life forms alongside the two groups of prokaryotes: the Bacteria and the Archaea.Eukaryotes represent a small minority of the number of organisms, but due to their generally much larger size, their collective global biomass is much larger than that of prokaryotes..The eukaryotes seemingly emerged in the Archaea, within the Asgard archaea.This implies that there are only two domains of life, Bacteria and Archaea, with eukaryotes incorporated among the Archaea.Eukaryotes emerged approximately 2.2 billion years ago, during the Proterozoic eon, likely as flagellated cells.The leading evolutionary theory is they were created by symbiogenesis between an anaerobic Asgard archaean and an aerobic proteobacterium, which formed the mitochondria.A second episode of symbiogenesis with a cyanobacterium created the plants, with chloroplasts.The oldest-known eukaryote fossils, multicellular planktonic organisms belonging to the Gabonionta, were discovered in Gabon in 2023, dating back to 2.1 billion years ago..Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus.Eukaryotes may be either unicellular or multicellular.", "Internet fraud": "Internet fraud is a type of cybercrime fraud or deception which makes use of the Internet and could involve hiding of information or providing incorrect information for the purpose of tricking victims out of money, property, and inheritance.[1] Internet fraud is not considered a single, distinctive crime but covers a range of illegal and illicit actions that are committed in cyberspace.[1] It is, however, differentiated from theft since, in this case, the victim voluntarily and knowingly provides the information, money or property to the perpetrator.[2] It is also distinguished by the way it involves temporally and spatially separated offenders.[3].According to the FBI's 2017 Internet Crime Report, the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received about 300,000 complaints.Victims lost over $1.4 billion in online fraud in 2017.[4] According to a study conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and McAfee, cybercrime costs the global economy as much as $600 billion, which translates into 0.8% of total global GDP.[5] Online fraud appears in many forms.It ranges from email spam to online scams.Internet fraud can occur even if partly based on the use of Internet services and is mostly or completely based on the use of the Internet..The scammer poses as a charitable organization soliciting donations to help the victims of a natural disaster, terrorist attack (such as the 9/11 attacks), regional conflict, or epidemic.Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 tsunami were popular targets of scammers perpetrating charity scams; other more timeless scam charities purport to be raising money for cancer, AIDS or Ebola virus research, children's orphanages (the scammer pretends to work for the orphanage or a non-profit associated with it), or impersonates charities such as the Red Cross or United Way.In recent years, there have been cases of scams being done by the people who started the charity.[6]  A recent example of this was the head of the Long Island Charity, Wafa Abbound.Abbound was found guilty of stealing close to a million dollars.She was charged with bank fraud, money laundering, and embezzling.[7] There are many methods scammers will use.First, they will ask for donations, often linking to online news articles to strengthen their story of a funds drive.The scammer's victims are charitable people who believe they are helping a worthy cause and expect nothing in return.", "International Security Assistance Force": "The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was a multinational military mission in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014.It was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386 pursuant to the Bonn Agreement, which outlined the establishment of a permanent Afghan government following the U.S.invasion in October 2001.[2][3] ISAF's primary goal was to train the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key government institutions; it gradually took part in the broader war in Afghanistan against the Taliban insurgency..ISAF's initial mandate was to secure the Afghan capital of Kabul and its surrounding area against opposition forces to facilitate the formation of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai.[4] In 2003, NATO took command of the mission at the request of the UN and Afghan government, marking its first deployment outside Europe and North America.Shortly thereafter, the UN Security Council expanded ISAF's mission to provide and maintain security beyond the capital region.[5] ISAF incrementally broadened its operations in four stages, and by 2006 took responsibility for the entire country; ISAF subsequently engaged in more intensive combat in southern and eastern Afghanistan.[6].At its peak between 2010 and 2012, ISAF had 400 military bases throughout Afghanistan (compared to 300 for the ANSF)[7] and roughly 130,000 troops.A total of 42 countries contributed troops to ISAF, including all 30 members of NATO.Personnel contributions varied greatly throughout the course of the mission: Initially, Canada was the largest contributor, though by 2010 the United States accounted for the majority of troops, followed by the United Kingdom, Turkey, Germany, France, and Italy; nations such as Georgia, Denmark, Norway, and Estonia were among the largest contributors per capita.[8] The intensity of the combat faced by participating countries varied greatly, with the U.S.sustaining the most casualties overall, while the British, Danish, Estonian, and Georgian forces suffered the most deaths for their size.The Canadian Armed Forces had the highest per-capita casualty rate among coalition members..Pursuant to its ultimate aim of transitioning security responsibilities to Afghan forces, ISAF ceased combat operations and was disbanded in December 2014.A number of troops remained to serve a supporting and advisory role as part of its successor organization, the Resolute Support Mission..", "Cocaine": "Cocaine (from French: coca\u00efne, from Spanish: coca, ultimately from Quechua: k\u00faka)[14] is a tropane alkaloid that acts as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant.As an extract, it is mainly used recreationally, and often illegally for its euphoric and rewarding effects.It is also used in medicine by Indigenous South Americans for various purposes and rarely, but more formally as a local anaesthetic by medical practitioners in more developed countries.It is primarily obtained from the leaves of two Coca species native to South America: Erythroxylum coca and E.novogranatense.[15][16] After extraction from the plant, and further processing into cocaine hydrochloride (powdered cocaine), the drug is administered by being either snorted, applied topically to the mouth, or dissolved and injected into a vein.It can also then be turned into free base form (typically crack cocaine), in which it can be heated until sublimated and then the vapours can be inhaled.[12].Cocaine stimulates the reward pathway in the brain.[16] Mental effects may include an intense feeling of happiness, sexual arousal, loss of contact with reality, or agitation.[12] Physical effects may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and dilated pupils.[12] High doses can result in high blood pressure or high body temperature.[17] Onset of effects can begin within seconds to minutes of use, depending on method of delivery, and can last between five and ninety minutes.[12] As cocaine also has numbing and blood vessel constriction properties, it is occasionally used during surgery on the throat or inside of the nose to control pain, bleeding, and vocal cord spasm.[18].Cocaine crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier via a proton-coupled organic cation antiporter[19][20] and (to a lesser extent) via passive diffusion across cell membranes.[21] Cocaine blocks the dopamine transporter,[22] inhibiting reuptake of dopamine from the synaptic cleft into the pre-synaptic axon terminal; the higher dopamine levels in the synaptic cleft increase dopamine receptor activation in the post-synaptic neuron,[23][24] causing euphoria and arousal.[25] Cocaine also blocks the serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter, inhibiting reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft into the pre-synaptic axon terminal and increasing activation of serotonin receptors and norepinephrine receptors in the post-synaptic neuron, contributing to the mental and physical effects of cocaine exposure.[6].A single dose of cocaine induces tolerance to the drug's effects.[26] Repeated use is likely to result in addiction.Addicts who abstain from cocaine may experience craving and drug withdrawal symptoms, with depression, decreased libido, decreased ability to feel pleasure, and fatigue being most common.[16] Use of cocaine increases the overall risk of death, and intravenous use potentially increases the risk of trauma and infectious diseases such as blood infections and HIV through the use of shared paraphernalia for use.It also increases risk of stroke, heart attack, cardiac arrhythmia, lung injury (when smoked), and sudden cardiac death.[16][27] Illicitly sold cocaine can be adulterated with fentanyl, local anesthetics, levamisole, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar, which can result in additional toxicity.[28][29] In 2017, the Global Burden of Disease study found that cocaine use caused around 7,300 deaths annually.[30].Coca leaves have been used by Andean civilizations since ancient times.[28] In ancient Wari culture,[31] Incan culture, and through modern successor indigenous cultures of the Andes mountains, coca leaves are chewed, taken orally in the form of a tea, or alternatively, prepared in a sachet wrapped around alkaline burnt ashes, and held in the mouth against the inner cheek; it has traditionally been used to combat the effects of cold, hunger, and altitude sickness.[32][33] Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860.[16].", "Tri-tip": "The tri-tip is a triangular cut of beef from the bottom sirloin subprimal cut, consisting of the tensor fasciae latae muscle.Untrimmed, the tri-tip weighs around 5 pounds.[1]  In the US, the tri-tip is taken from NAMP cut 185C..The term \"tri-tip\" is used across the US, but is especially popular in California.[2] The precise origin of the name  for this cut of beef is unclear, with several sources claiming original usage of the term.This cut of beef has been referred to by a variety of names including \"Newport steak\u201d,[3] \"Santa Maria steak\u201d, \"triangle tip\u201d, and \"triangle steak\u201d..The cut was known in the United States as early as 1915, called \"the triangle part\" of the loin butt.[4] Rondo (Ron) Brough, a butcher for the US Army during World War II working in Southern California, claimed that he created the \"triangle tip\" cut as a way to gain an extra portion of meat for the troops by reorienting nearby cuts and eliminating scrap.This practice caught on with Brough's Army colleagues and after the War, they began cutting and serving triangle tip throughout restaurants and butcher shops in California..Otto Schaefer Sr.originally named and marketed tri-tip in Oakland, California, in the 1950s.[5].Butcher and restaurateur[6] Jack Ubaldi claimed to have originally named and marketed tri-tip under the name \"Newport steak\" in the 1950s.[3].Triangle tip, cooked in wine, was served at Jack's Corsican Room in Long Beach in 1955.[7]  The cut was marketed under the name \"tri-tip\" as early as 1964, at Desert Provisions in Palm Springs.[8].Larry Viegas, a butcher at a Santa Maria Safeway store in the late 1950s, claimed that the idea to cook this as a distinct cut of beef first occurred to his store manager, Bob Schutz, when an excess of hamburger existed in the store (into which this part of the animal were usually ground).[9] Viegas says that Schultz took a piece of the unwanted meat, seasoned it with salt, pepper, and garlic salt, and placed it on a rotisserie for 45 minutes or an hour; the result was well-received, and Schultz began marketing the cut as \"tri-tip\".[9].It became a local specialty in Santa Maria in the late 1950s.[9] Today, it is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and other seasonings, grilled directly over red oak wood to medium-rare doneness.", "Willmar, Minnesota": "Willmar (/\u02c8w\u026alm\u0259r/ WIL-m\u0259r)[6] is a city in, and the county seat of, Kandiyohi County, Minnesota, United States.[7] The population was 21,015 at the 2020 census.[3].Agricultural expansion and the establishment of Willmar as a division point on the Great Northern Railway determined its growth.The first settlers arrived during the 1850s, attracted to the fertile land and an abundance of timber and game.The Dakota War of 1862 left the township abandoned for several years.The advent of the railroad in Kandiyohi County in 1869 brought new settlers.[8] Many were of Swedish and Norwegian origin; residents of Scandinavian heritage are still a majority.In 1870, Leon (Chadwick) Willmar, a Belgian acting as an agent for the European bondholder of the St.Paul and Pacific Railroad, purchased the title to Section 1 of Willmar Township.[9] Willmar was established as the county seat in 1871 and was incorporated as a village in 1874 and as a city in 1901.[10].Willmar was the site of a bank robbery by the Machine Gun Kelly gang on July 15, 1930.They robbed the Bank of Willmar (later Bremer Bank) of about $70,000 (equivalent to $1,226,000 in 2022) and wounded three people.[11].The Willmar Memorial Auditorium, designed by architect William Ingemann, was the largest assembly hall within 70 miles when completed in 1938.It was funded by the city of Willmar and state and federal governments as a Depression-era works project.It contains several murals by Richard Haines commissioned by the Federal Art Project, and wood paneling in the oak doors by WPA artists.[8] It is on the National Register of Historic Places.[12].", "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives": "The speaker of the United States House of Representatives, commonly known as the speaker of the House, is the presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives.The office was established in 1789 by Article I, Section II, of the U.S.Constitution.[a] By custom and House rules, the speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House and is simultaneously its presiding officer, de facto leader of the body's majority party, and the institution's administrative head.Speakers also perform various other administrative and procedural functions.Given these several roles and responsibilities, the speaker usually does not personally preside over debates\u2014that duty is instead delegated to members of the House from the majority party\u2014nor regularly participate in floor debates.[7].The Constitution does not explicitly require the speaker to be an incumbent member of the House of Representatives, although every speaker thus far has been, and as a member the speaker also represents their district and retains the right to vote.[8][9] The speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the vice president and ahead of the president pro tempore of the Senate.[3].The 56th and current Speaker of the House is Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana.[10].The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress (i.e., biennially, after a general election) or when a speaker dies, resigns or is removed from the position during a term (which has happened only once).At the start of a new Congress, those voting to elect the speaker are representatives-elect, as a speaker must be selected before members are sworn in to office; the House of Representatives cannot organize or take other legislative actions until a speaker is elected.[11].Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote.[12] In practice, each party's caucus or conference selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call.To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive a majority of votes from the members present and voting.If no candidate wins a majority, the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected.[13] Representatives are free to vote for someone other than the candidate nominated by their party but generally do not, as the outcome of the election effectively demonstrates which party has the majority and consequently will organize the House.[13].", "Bicycle frame": "A bicycle frame is the main component of a bicycle, onto which wheels and other components are fitted.The modern and most common frame design for an upright bicycle is based on the safety bicycle, and consists of two triangles: a main triangle and a paired rear triangle.This is known as the diamond frame.[1] Frames are required to be strong, stiff and light, which they do by combining different materials and shapes..A frameset consists of the frame and fork of a bicycle and sometimes includes the headset and seat post.[2] Frame builders will often produce the frame and fork together as a paired set..Besides the ubiquitous diamond frame,[1] many different frame types have been developed for the bicycle, several of which are still in common use today..In the diamond frame, the main \"triangle\" is not actually a triangle because it consists of four tubes: the head tube, top tube, down tube and seat tube.The rear triangle consists of the seat tube joined by paired chain stays and seat stays..The head tube contains the headset, the interface with the fork.The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top.The top tube may be positioned horizontally (parallel to the ground), or it may slope downwards towards the seat tube for additional stand-over clearance.The down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket shell..The rear triangle connects to the rear fork ends, where the rear wheel is attached.", "Pendulum": "A pendulum is a device made of a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely.[1] When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting, equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position.When released, the restoring force acting on the pendulum's mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth.The time for one complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period.The period depends on the length of the pendulum and also to a slight degree on the amplitude, the width of the pendulum's swing..The regular motion of pendulums was used for timekeeping and was the world's most accurate timekeeping technology until the 1930s.[2] The pendulum clock invented by Christiaan Huygens in 1656 became the world's standard timekeeper, used in homes and offices for 270 years, and achieved accuracy of about one second per year before it was superseded as a time standard by the quartz clock in the 1930s.Pendulums are also used in scientific instruments such as accelerometers and seismometers.Historically they were used as gravimeters to measure the acceleration of gravity in geo-physical surveys, and even as a standard of length.The word pendulum is Neo-Latin, from the Latin pendulus, meaning hanging.[3].The simple gravity pendulum[4] is an idealized mathematical model of a pendulum.[5][6][7] This is a weight (or bob) on the end of a massless cord suspended from a pivot, without friction.When given an initial push, it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude.Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag, so the amplitude of their swings declines..The period of swing of a simple gravity pendulum depends on its length, the local strength of gravity, and to a small extent on the maximum angle that the pendulum swings away from vertical, \u03b80, called the amplitude.[8]  It is independent of the mass of the bob.", "First Battle of Bull Run": "Department of Northeastern Virginia:.Department of Pennsylvania:.Army of the Potomac[4].Army of Northeastern Virginia:.The First Battle of Bull Run, called the Battle of First Manassas[1] by Confederate forces, was the first major battle of the American Civil War.The battle was fought on July 21, 1861, in Prince William County, Virginia, just north of the city of Manassas and about thirty miles west-southwest of Washington, D.C.The Union Army was slow in positioning themselves, allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail.Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops.The battle was a Confederate victory and was followed by a disorganized post-battle retreat of the Union forces..Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter, the northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, which was expected to bring an early end to the Confederacy.Yielding to political pressure, Brigadier General Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brigadier General P.G.", "Weather": "Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.[1] On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's atmosphere, the troposphere,[2][3] just below the stratosphere.Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[4] When used without qualification, \"weather\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth..Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another.These differences can occur due to the Sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude.The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream.Weather systems in the middle latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow.Because Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year.On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range \u00b140\u00b0C (\u221240\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F) annually.Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change..Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant.Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location.", "List of awards and nominations received by Katy Perry": "American singer Katy Perry has received various awards and nominations throughout her career.She is the recipient of five American Music Awards, 16 ASCAP Pop Music Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, four Guinness World Records, five MTV Video Music Awards, 14 People's Choice Awards, a Juno Award, a Brit Award, two Myx

countries where English is an official language": "The following is a list of countries and territories where English is an official language\u2014that is, a language used in citizen interactions with government officials.As of 2020[update], there were 58 sovereign states and 28 non-sovereign entities where English was an official language.[citation needed] Many administrative divisions have declared English an official language at the local or regional level..Most states where English is an official language are former territories of the British Empire.Exceptions include Rwanda and Burundi, which were formerly German and then Belgian colonies; Cameroon, where only part of national territory was under British mandate; and Liberia, the Philippines, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, which were American territories.English is the sole official language of the Commonwealth of Nations and of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).English is one of the official languages of the United Nations, the European Union, \u0649, the African Union, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Caribbean Community, the Union of South American Nations, and many other international organisations.Although English is not de jure an official language at the national level in the United States, most states and territories within the United States have English as an official language, and only Puerto Rico uses a language other than English as a primary working language..The United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, where the overwhelming majority of native English speakers reside, do not have English as an official language de jure, but English is considered their de facto official language because it dominates in these countries.[citation needed].In these countries, English is conventionally spoken by both the government and main population, despite it having no de jure official status at national level.In these countries, English is spoken in government or education, but it is not recognized as de jure official, nor a primary language spoken by the main population.In these country subdivisions, English has de jure official status, but English is not official in their respective countries at the national level..Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate.", "Southern Cone": "The Southern Cone (Spanish: Cono Sur, Portuguese: Cone Sul) is a geographical and cultural subregion composed of the southernmost areas of South America, mostly south of the Tropic of Capricorn.Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean.In terms of social, economic and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, and sometimes includes Brazil's four southernmost states (Paran\u00e1, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and S\u00e3o Paulo).In its broadest definition, taking into account common history and geography, it also includes Paraguay, another Spanish-speaking[note 3] country.[2].The Southern Cone is the most prosperous subregion in Latin America due to and shown by its high life expectancy, the highest Human Development Index of Latin America, high standard of living, low fertility rates, temperate climate, significant participation in global markets, and the emerging economy of its members (Argentina, Uruguay and Chile); which are located at latitudes in the southern hemisphere that would correspond in the northern hemisphere to the United States, Canadian provinces, European countries (except Scandinavia), northern China, the Korean peninsula and Japan.[2][3].The climates are mostly temperate, but include humid subtropical, Mediterranean, highland tropical, maritime temperate, sub-Antarctic temperate, highland cold, desert and semi-arid temperate regions.Except for the northern regions of Argentina (thermal equator in January), the whole country of Paraguay, the Argentina-Brazil border and the interior of the Atacama Desert, the region rarely suffers from heat.In addition to that, the winter presents mostly cool temperatures.Strong and constant wind and high humidity are what brings low temperatures in the winter.The Atacama is the driest place on Earth..One of the most peculiar plants of the region is the Araucaria tree, which can be found in Brazil, Chile and Argentina.The only native group of conifers found in the southern hemisphere had its origin in the Southern Cone.", "Meeting": "A meeting is when two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics, often in a formal or business setting, but meetings also occur in a variety of other environments.Meetings can be used as form of group decision making..A meeting is a gathering of two or more people that has been convened for the purpose of achieving a common goal through verbal interaction, such as sharing information or reaching agreement.[1] Meetings may occur face-to-face or virtually, as mediated by communications technology, such as a telephone conference call, a skyped conference call or a videoconference.One Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a meeting as \"an act or process of coming together\" - for example \"as [...] an assembly for a common purpose [...]\".[2].Meeting planners and other meeting professionals may use the term \"meeting\" to denote an event booked at a hotel, convention center or any other venue dedicated to such gatherings.[1][3].Anthropologist Helen B.Schwartzman defines a meeting as \"a communicative event involving three or more people who agree to assemble for a purpose ostensibly related to the functioning of an organization or group.\"[4] For her, meetings are characterized by \"multiparty talk that is episodic in nature, and participants either develop or use specific conventions for regulating this talk.\"[4].The term \"meeting\" may refer to a lecture (one presentation), seminar (typically several presentations, small audience, one day), conference (mid-size, one or more days), congress (large, several days), exhibition or trade show (with staffed stands being visited by passers-by), workshop (smaller, with active participants), training course, team-building session and kick-off event..Common types of meeting include:.Other varieties include breakfast meetings[7] off-site meetings (or Awayday meetings in the UK), and \"stand-up meetings\" where participants stand up to encourage brevity..Since a meeting can be held once or often, the meeting organizer has to determine the repetition and frequency of occurrence of the meeting: one-time, recurring meeting, or a series meeting such as a monthly \"lunch and learn\" event at a company, church, club or organization in which the placeholder is the same, but the agenda and topics to be covered vary.[citation needed] In Russian, a \"flying meeting\" (Russian: \u043b\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433, romanized:letuchij miting) is a hastily called brief meeting.[8].Meetings have been studied using conversation analysis.", "Official game": "In baseball, an official game (regulation game in the Major League Baseball rulebook) is a game where nine innings have been played, except when the game is scheduled with fewer innings, extra innings are required to determine a winner, or the game must be stopped before nine innings have been played, e.g.due to inclement weather.The term \"official game\" is mainly used in the context of a game that is stopped before nine innings have been played, though it has been used for other promotional purposes..A game that is stopped (\"called\" in the MLB rulebook) by the umpires before the regulation number of innings have been played may be considered an official game if five innings have been played (4+1\u20442 innings if the home team is in the lead), unless the game meets one of the conditions for a suspended game.An official game that is stopped in this way is ended at the point of stoppage and statistics are added to each team's totals, while a suspended game is resumed from the point of stoppage at a later time.A game that is stopped before five innings have been played is considered \"no game\" unless it can be considered a suspended game; statistics accumulated before the stoppage are not counted and replay of the game is subject to the league rules..In the case of inclement weather, any game which has reached this point may be stopped and shortened as needed, with the result being final, and all records and statistics counted.A game which has not reached this point before being stopped is either considered a suspended game (to be continued at a later date from the point of stoppage), or is simply canceled and replayed from the start.(This depends on the rules of each individual league.) In either case, no statistics are counted until the game becomes official..Since most professional baseball games are nine innings long, the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game.If the visiting team is leading, or the game is tied, the end of the fifth inning marks this point.If the home team (which bats last) is already ahead in the score, and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning, then 4\u00bd innings (i.e., the middle of the fifth) is considered an official game.", "Telephone number": "A telephone number is a sequence of digits assigned to a landline telephone subscriber station connected to a telephone line or to a wireless electronic telephony device, such as a radio telephone or a mobile telephone, or to other devices for data transmission via the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or other public and private networks..A telephone number serves as an address for switching telephone calls using a system of destination code routing.[1]  Telephone numbers are entered or dialed by a calling party on the originating telephone set, which transmits the sequence of digits in the process of signaling to a telephone exchange.The exchange completes the call either to another locally connected subscriber or via the PSTN to the called party.Telephone numbers are assigned within the framework of a national or regional telephone numbering plan to subscribers by telephone service operators, which may be commercial entities, state-controlled administrations, or other telecommunication industry associations..Telephone numbers were first used in 1879 in Lowell, Massachusetts, when they replaced the request for subscriber names by callers connecting to the switchboard operator.[2] Over the course of telephone history, telephone numbers had various lengths and formats and even included most letters of the alphabet in leading positions when telephone exchange names were in common use until the 1960s..Telephone numbers are often dialed in conjunction with other signaling code sequences, such as vertical service codes, to invoke special telephone service features.[3][4].When telephone numbers were first used they were very short, from one to three digits, and were communicated orally to a switchboard operator when initiating a call.As telephone systems have grown and interconnected to encompass worldwide communication, telephone numbers have become longer.In addition to telephones, they have been used to access other devices, such as computer modems, pagers, and fax machines.With landlines, modems and pagers falling out of use in favor of all-digital always-connected broadband Internet and mobile phones, telephone numbers are now often used by data-only cellular devices, such as some tablet computers, digital televisions, video game controllers, and mobile hotspots, on which it is not even possible to make or accept a call..The number contains the information necessary to identify the intended endpoint for a telephone call.Many countries use fixed-length numbers in a so-called closed numbering plan.[5] A prominent system of this type is the North American Numbering Plan.", "Collection agency": "Debt collection is the process of pursuing payments of money or other agreed-upon value owed to a creditor.The debtors may be by individuals or businesses.An organization that specializes in debt collection is known as a collection agency or debt collector.[1] Most collection agencies operate as agents of creditors and collect debts for a fee or percentage of the total amount owed.[2] Historically, debtors could face debt slavery, debtor's prison, or coercive collection methods.In the 21st century in many countries, legislation regulates debt collectors, and limits harassment and practices deemed unfair..Debt collection has been around as long as there has been debt and is older than the history of money itself, as it existed within earlier systems based on bartering.Debt collection goes back to the ancient civilizations, starting in Sumer in 3000 BC.In these civilizations if a debt was owed that could not be paid back, the debtor and the debtor's spouse, children or servants were forced into \"debt slavery\" until the creditor recouped losses via their physical labor.Under Babylonian Law, strict guidelines governed the repayment of debts, including several basic debtor protections..In some societies debts would be carried over into subsequent generations and debt slavery would continue, but some early societies provided for periodic debt forgiveness such as a jubilees or would set a time limit on a debt.[3].The Bible issues stern restrictions regarding how much interest to charge on a loan.The Quran prohibits any amount of interest on loans given and encourages direct transactions.The Abrahamic religions discouraged lending and prohibited creditors from collecting interest on debts owed.", "Cannabis (drug)": "Cannabis,[a] also known as marijuana[b] among other names, is a psychoactive drug from the cannabis plant.Native to Central or South Asia, the cannabis plant has been used as a drug for both recreational and entheogenic purposes and in various traditional medicines for centuries.Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive component of cannabis, which is one of the 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 65 other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD).Cannabis can be used by smoking, vaporizing, within food, or as an extract..Cannabis has various mental and physical effects, which include euphoria, altered states of mind and sense of time, difficulty concentrating, impaired short-term memory, impaired body movement (balance and fine psychomotor control), relaxation, and an increase in appetite.Onset of effects is felt within minutes when smoked, but may take up to 90 minutes when eaten (as orally consumed drugs must be metabolized).The effects last for two to six hours, depending on the amount used.At high doses, mental effects can include anxiety, delusions (including ideas of reference), hallucinations, panic, paranoia, and psychosis.There is a strong relation between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis, though the direction of causality is debated.Physical effects include increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, nausea, and behavioral problems in children whose mothers used cannabis during pregnancy; short-term side effects may also include dry mouth and red eyes.Long-term adverse effects may include addiction, decreased mental ability in those who started regular use as adolescents[3], chronic coughing, susceptibility to respiratory infections, and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome..Cannabis is mostly used recreationally or as a medicinal drug, although it may also be used for spiritual purposes.", "List of Washington Redskins starting quarterbacks": "These quarterbacks

referred to variously as Delta Force, Combat Applications Group (CAG), Army Compartmented Elements (ACE), or within Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), Task Force Green,[2] is a special operations force of the United States Army, under operational control of JSOC.The unit's missions primarily involve counterterrorism, hostage rescue, direct action, and special reconnaissance, often against high-value targets..Delta Force, along with the Intelligence Support Activity, and its Navy and Air Force counterparts, DEVGRU (SEAL Team Six) and the 24th Special Tactics Squadron, are the U.S.military's tier one special mission units that are tasked with performing the most complex, covert, and dangerous missions directed by the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense.[9][10].Most Delta Force operators are selected from the Army Special Operations Command's elite 75th Ranger Regiment and U.S.Army Special Forces, though selection is open to other special operations units and conventional forces across the Army and sometimes other military branches.[11][12].Delta Force was created in 1977 after numerous well-publicized terrorist incidents led the U.S.government to develop a full-time counter-terrorism unit..Key military and government figures had already been briefed on this type of unit in the early 1960s.Charlie Beckwith, a Special Forces (Green Berets) officer and Vietnam War veteran, served as an exchange officer with the British Army's 22nd Special Air Service Regiment during the Malayan Emergency.On his return, Beckwith presented a detailed report highlighting the U.S.Army's vulnerability in not having a SAS-type unit.", "Radioactive decay": "Radioactive decay (also known as nuclear decay, radioactivity, radioactive disintegration, or nuclear disintegration) is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation.A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive.Three of the most common types of decay are alpha, beta, and gamma decay.The weak force is the mechanism that is responsible for beta decay, while the other two are governed by the electromagnetism and nuclear force.[1].Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e.random) process at the level of single atoms.According to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay, regardless of how long the atom has existed.[2][3][4] However, for a significant number of identical atoms, the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as half-life.The half-lives of radioactive atoms have a huge range; from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe..The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide (or parent radioisotope[note 1]), and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide.Except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state, the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of protons or neutrons (or both).When the number of protons changes, an atom of a different chemical element is created..There are 28 naturally occurring chemical elements on Earth that are radioactive, consisting of 34 radionuclides (6 elements have 2 different radionuclides) that date before the time of formation of the Solar System.", "Waxing": "Waxing is the process of hair removal from the root by using a covering of a sticky substance, such as wax, to adhere to body hair, and then removing this covering and pulling out the hair from the follicle.New hair will not grow back in the previously waxed area for four to six weeks, although some people will start to see regrowth in only a week due to some of their hair being on a different human hair growth cycle.Almost any area of the body can be waxed, including eyebrows, face, pubic hair (called bikini waxing or intimate waxing), legs, arms, back, abdomen, chest, knuckles, and feet.There are many types of waxing suitable for removing unwanted hair..Strip waxing (soft wax) is accomplished by spreading a wax thinly over the skin.A cloth or paper strip is applied and pressed firmly, adhering the strip to the wax and the wax to the skin.The strip is then quickly ripped against the direction of hair growth, as parallel as possible to the skin to avoid trauma to the skin.This removes the wax along with the hair.There are different forms of strip waxing or soft waxing: heated, cold or pre-made strips.Unlike cold waxing, heated wax is spread easily over the skin.Cold waxing is thicker, which makes it more difficult to spread smoothly over the skin.Pre-made strips come with the wax on them, and they come in different sizes for different area uses.[1].", "Culture of ancient Rome": "The culture of ancient Rome existed throughout the almost 1,200-year history of the civilization of Ancient Rome.The term refers to the culture of the Roman Republic, later the Roman Empire, which at its peak covered an area from present-day Lowland Scotland and Morocco to the Euphrates..Life in ancient Rome revolved around the city of Rome, its famed seven hills, and its monumental architecture such as the Colosseum, Trajan's Forum, and the Pantheon.The city also had several theaters and gymnasia, along with many taverns, baths and brothels.Throughout the territory under ancient Rome's control, residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas, and in the capital city of Rome, there were imperial residences on the elegant Palatine Hill, from which the word palace is derived.The vast majority of the population lived in the city center, packed into insulae (apartment blocks)..The city of Rome was the largest megalopolis of that time, with a population that may well have exceeded one million people, with a high-end estimate of 3.6 million and a low-end estimate of 450,000.A substantial proportion of the population under the city's jurisdiction lived in innumerable urban centers, with population of at least 10,000,000,000 and several military settlements, a very high rate of urbanization by pre-industrial standards.The most urbanized part of the Empire was Italy, which had an estimated rate of urbanization of 32%, the same rate of urbanization of England in 1800.Most Roman towns and cities had a forum, temples and the same type of buildings, on a smaller scale, as found in Rome.The large urban population required an enormous supply of food, which was a complex logistical task, including acquiring, transporting, storing and distribution of food for Rome and other urban centers.Italian farms supplied vegetables and fruits, but fish and meat were luxuries.", "Duffy Waldorf": "James Joseph \"Duffy\" Waldorf, Jr.(born August 20, 1962) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour Champions.He was previously a member of the PGA Tour, where he won four times..Waldorf was born in Los Angeles, California.He attended UCLA[2] where he was on the golf team from 1982 to 1985.He was a two-time NCAA All-American, 1985 College Player of the Year, and was selected for the 1985 Walker Cup..Waldorf turned professional in 1985 and joined the PGA Tour..Waldorf's career PGA Tour earnings are over $11.9 million.He has featured in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings, peaking at 35th in 2000..Waldorf finished T-14 in the

glassblowing that produces bottles and other containers.It has been done in a variety of ways during the history of glass..Broadly, modern glass container factories are three-part operations: the \"batch house\", the \"hot end\", and the \"cold end\".The batch house handles the raw materials; the hot end handles the manufacture proper\u2014the forehearth, forming machines, and annealing ovens; and the cold end handles the product-inspection and packaging equipment..Batch processing is one of the initial steps of the glass-making process.The batch house simply houses the raw materials in large silos (fed by truck or railcar), and holds anywhere from 1\u20135 days of material.Some batch systems include material processing such as raw material screening/sieve, drying, or pre-heating (i.e.cullet).Whether automated or manual, the batch house measures, assembles, mixes, and delivers the glass raw material recipe (batch) via an array of chutes, conveyors, and scales to the furnace.The batch enters the furnace at the \"dog house\" or \"batch charger\".Different glass types, colours, desired quality, raw material purity/availability, and furnace design will affect the batch recipe..The hot end of a glassworks is where the molten glass is manufactured into glass products.", "Season": "A season is a division of the year[1] based on changes in weather, ecology, and the number of daylight hours in a given region.On Earth, seasons are the result of the axial parallelism of Earth's tilted orbit around the Sun.[2][3][4] In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations, and as such there are a number of both modern and historical cultures whose number of seasons varies..The Northern Hemisphere experiences most direct sunlight during May, June, and July, as the hemisphere faces the Sun.The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January.It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux.However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere..In temperate and sub-polar regions, four seasons based on the Gregorian calendar are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn (or fall), and winter.Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions which are not tied to any fixed calendar dates: prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, autumnal, and hibernal.Many tropical regions have two seasons: the rainy, wet, or monsoon season and the dry season.Some have a third cool, mild, or harmattan season.\"Seasons\" can also be dictated by the timing of important ecological events such as hurricane season, tornado season, and wildfire season.[citation needed] Some examples of historical importance are the ancient Egyptian seasons\u2014flood, growth, and low water\u2014which were previously defined by the former annual flooding of the Nile in Egypt..", "Battle of Fort Sumter": "The Battle of Fort Sumter (April 12\u201313, 1861) was the bombardment of Fort Sumter near Charleston, South Carolina by the South Carolina militia.It ended with its surrender by the United States Army, beginning the American Civil War..Following the declaration of secession by South Carolina on December 20, 1860, its authorities demanded that the U.S.Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor.On December 26, Major Robert Anderson of the U.S.Army, in violation of the unofficial truce deal made between the US and CS governments,[6] surreptitiously moved his small command from the vulnerable Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island to Fort Sumter, a substantial fortress built on an island controlling the entrance of Charleston Harbor.An attempt by U.S.President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861.The ship was hit three times, which caused no major damage but nonetheless kept the supplies from reaching Anderson.Seeing its deal with the Federal Government having been violated, South Carolina authorities then seized all Federal property in the Charleston area except for Fort Sumter..During the early months of 1861, the situation around Fort Sumter increasingly began to resemble a siege.In March, Brigadier General P.", "3G": "3G is the third generation of wireless mobile telecommunications technology.It is the upgrade over 2G, 2.5G, GPRS and 2.75G Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution networks, offering faster data transfer, and better voice quality.[1] This network was superseded by 4G, and later on by 5G.This network is based on a set of standards used for mobile devices and mobile telecommunications use services and networks that comply with the International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) specifications by the International Telecommunication Union.3G finds application in wireless voice telephony, mobile Internet access, fixed wireless Internet access, video calls and mobile TV.[1].3G telecommunication networks support services that provide an information transfer rate of at least 144 kbit/s.[2][3] Later 3G releases, often denoted 3.5G and 3.75G, also provide mobile broadband access of several Mbit/s to smartphones and mobile modems in laptop computers.This ensures it can be applied to wireless voice calls, mobile Internet access, fixed wireless Internet access, video calls and mobile TV technologies..A new generation of cellular standards has appeared approximately every tenth year since 1G systems were introduced in 1979 and the early to mid-1980s.Each generation is characterized by new frequency bands, higher data rates and non\u2013backward-compatible transmission technology.The first commercial 3G networks were introduced in mid-2001.[4][5][6][7].Several telecommunications companies marketed wireless mobile Internet services as 3G, indicating that the advertised service was provided over a 3G wireless network.However, 3G services have largely been supplanted in marketing by 4G and 5G services in most areas of the world.Services advertised as 3G are required to meet IMT-2000 technical standards, including standards for reliability and speed (data transfer rates).", "Mazel tov": "\"Mazel tov\" (Yiddish: \u05de\u05d6\u05dc \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1, romanized:m\u00e1zl tov) or \"mazal tov\" (Hebrew: \u05de\u05d6\u05dc \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1, romanized:maz\u00e1l tov; lit.\"good fortune\") is a Jewish phrase used to express congratulations for a happy and significant occasion or event..The word mazel comes from the Biblical Hebrew mazz\u0101l, meaning \"constellation\" or (in Mishnaic Hebrew) \"astrological sign\" and may be related to the root \u05e0-\u05d6-\u05dc meaning \"to flow down\".The phrase mazel tov first appears in Geonic Hebrew, where it means \"positive astrological sign\"  or simply \"good fortune.\"[1] The Medieval Hebrew chant siman tov u-mazel tov, yehe lanu ulkhol yisrael \"A good sign, a good omen! Let it happen for us and for all Israel\" was used to congratulate, and the phrase itself acquired a congratulatory usage in Yiddish and Hebrew by the early 19th century and was later incorporated into Modern Hebrew.The Yiddish and Ashkenazic pronunciation of mazel has the stress on the first syllable while the Modern Hebrew word mazal has the stress on the last syllable.Mazel-tov is also used as a personal name..The phrase \"mazel tov\" is recorded as entering into American English from Yiddish in 1862,[2] pronounced /\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0z\u0259lt\u0252v, -t\u0252f/ MAH-z\u0259l-TOV, -\u2060TOF.[3] The word mazel was lent to a number of European languages, meaning \"luck\", such as: German, as Massel;  Hungarian, as m\u00e1zli; Dutch, as mazzel  and the verb mazzelen (\"to be lucky\").[4] The word tov also entered Dutch as tof or toffe (\"nice\" or \"great\")[5] and German as t\u00f6fte or dufte.[6].Mazel tov is literally translated as \"good luck\" in its meaning as a description, not a wish.The implicit meaning is \"good luck has occurred\" or \"your fortune has been good\" and the expression is an acknowledgement of that fact.It is similar in usage to the word \"congratulations!\" and conveys roughly, \"I am pleased this good thing has happened to you!\"[citation needed] A common Hebrew phrase for wishing \"good luck\" is b'hatzlacha (\u05d1\u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\u05d7\u05d4), literally meaning \"with success\".[7].Throughout the Jewish world, including the diaspora, \"mazel tov!\" is a common Jewish expression at events such as a bar or bat mitzvah or a wedding.For example, In Israel, at a Jewish wedding, it is shouted by the couple's friends and family after the ceremonial breaking of the glass.", "Hepatitis C": "Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver;[2] it is a type of viral hepatitis.[6] During the initial infection period, people often have mild or no symptoms.[1] Early symptoms can include fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin.[1] The virus persists in the liver, becoming chronic, in about 70% of those initially infected.[4] Early on, chronic infection typically has no symptoms.[1] Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis.[1] In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop serious complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach.[2].HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with injection drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions.[1][3] In regions where blood screening has been implemented, the risk of contracting HCV from a transfusion has dropped substantially to less than one per two million.[1] HCV may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth.[1] It is not spread through breast milk, food, water or casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.[4] It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.[7].Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or viral RNA.[1] In the United States, screening for HCV infection is recommended in all adults age 18 to 79 years old.[8].There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.[1][9] Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who inject drugs, testing donated blood, and treatment of people with chronic infection.[4][10] Chronic infection can be cured more than 95% of the time with antiviral medications such as sofosbuvir or simeprevir.[1][4] Peginterferon and ribavirin were earlier generation treatments that proved successful in <50% of cases and caused greater side effects.[4]:\u200a2015 version\u200a[11] While access to the newer treatments was expensive,  by 2022 prices had dropped dramatically in many countries (primarily low-income and lower-middle-income countries) due to the introduction of generic versions of  medicines.[4] Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant.[5] Hepatitis C is one of the leading reasons for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation.[5].An estimated 58 million people worldwide were infected with hepatitis C in 2019.Approximately 290,000 deaths from the virus, mainly from liver cancer and cirrhosis attributed to hepatitis C, also occurred in 2019.[12] The existence of hepatitis C \u2013 originally identifiable only as a type of non-A non-B hepatitis \u2013 was suggested in the 1970s and proven in 1989.[13] Hepatitis C infects only humans and chimpanzees.[14].Acute symptoms develop in some 20% of those infected.[4][1] When this occurs, it is generally 4\u201312 weeks following infection (but it may take from 2 weeks to 6 months for acute symptoms to appear).[1][4].Symptoms are generally mild and vague, and may include fatigue, nausea and vomiting, fever, muscle or joint pains, abdominal pain, decreased appetite and weight loss, jaundice (occurs in ~25% of those infected), dark urine, and clay-coloured stools.[1][15][16] Acute liver failure due to acute hepatitis C is exceedingly rare.[17] Symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of liver disease should prompt further tests and can thus help establish a diagnosis of hepatitis C infection early on.[16].Following the acute phase, the infection may resolve spontaneously in 10\u201350% of affected people; this occurs more frequently in young people and females.[15].About 70% of those exposed to the virus develop a chronic infection.[4] This is defined as the presence of detectable viral replication for at least six months.Though most experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few decades of a chronic infection,[18] chronic hepatitis C can be associated with fatigue[19] and mild cognitive problems.[20] After several years, chronic infection may cause cirrhosis or liver cancer.[5] The liver enzymes measured from blood samples are normal in 7\u201353%.[21] (Elevated levels indicate liver cells are being damaged by the virus or other disease).Late relapses after apparent cure have been reported, but these can be difficult to distinguish from reinfection.[21].", "Flexible spending account": "In the United States, a flexible spending account (FSA), also known as a flexible spending arrangement, is one of a number of tax-advantaged financial accounts, resulting in payroll tax savings.[1] One significant disadvantage to using an FSA is that funds not used by the end of the plan year are forfeited to the employer, known as the \"use it or lose it\" rule.Under the terms of the Affordable Care Act however a plan may permit an employee to carry over up to $550[2] into the following year without losing the funds but this does not apply to all plans and some plans may have lower limits..The most common type of flexible spending account, the medical expense FSA (also medical FSA or health FSA), is similar to a health savings account (HSA) or a health reimbursement account (HRA).However, while HSAs and HRAs are almost exclusively used as components of a consumer-driven health care plan, medical FSAs are commonly offered with more traditional health plans as well.In addition, funds in an HSA are not lost when the plan year is over, unlike funds in an FSA.[needs update] Paper forms or an FSA debit card may be used to access the account funds..Most cafeteria plans offer two major different flexible spending accounts focused on medical and dependent care expenses.A few cafeteria plans offer other types of FSAs, especially if the employer also offers an HSA.Participation in one type of FSA does not affect participation in another type of FSA, but funds cannot be transferred from one FSA to another.[3].The most common type of FSA is used to pay for medical and dental expenses not paid for by insurance, usually deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance for the employee's health plan..As of January 1, 2011, over-the-counter medications are allowed only when purchased with a doctor's prescription, except for insulin.[4] Over-the-counter medical devices, such as bandages, crutches, and eyeglass repair kits, are allowable.Generally, allowable items are the same as those allowable for the medical tax deduction, as outlined in IRS publication 502.[5].Prior to the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Internal Revenue Service permitted employers to enact any maximum annual election for their employees.", "Tennessee": "Tennessee (/\u02cct\u025bn\u026a\u02c8si\u02d0/ \u24d8 TEN-iss-EE, locally /\u02c8t\u025bn\u026asi/ TEN-iss-ee; Cherokee: \u13d4\u13be\u13cf, romanized:Tanasi),[7][8][9] officially the State of Tennessee, is a landlocked state in the Southeastern region of the United States.Tennessee is the 36th-largest by area and the 15th-most populous of the 50 states.It is bordered by Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas to the southwest, and Missouri to the northwest.Tennessee is geographically, culturally, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions of East, Middle, and West Tennessee.Nashville is the state's capital and largest city, and anchors its largest metropolitan area.Other major cities include Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Clarksville.Tennessee's population as of the 2020 United States census is approximately 6.9 million.[10].Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association, a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachian Mountains.[11] Its name derives from Tanasi (\u13d4\u13be\u13cf), a Cherokee town in the eastern part of the state that existed before the first European American settlement.[12] Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later the Southwest Territory, before its admission to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796.It earned the nickname \"The Volunteer State\" early in its history due to a strong tradition of military service.[13] A slave state until the American Civil War, Tennessee was politically divided, with its western and middle parts supporting the Confederacy and the eastern region harboring pro-Union sentiment.As a result, Tennessee was the last state to secede and the first readmitted to the Union after the war.[14].During the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from a predominantly agrarian society to a more diversified economy.This was aided in part by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the city of Oak Ridge, which was established during World War II to house the Manhattan Project's uranium enrichment facilities for the construction of the world's first atomic bombs.", "Cock ring": "A cock ring or cockring (also called a C ring, erection ring, penis ring, shaft ring, tension ring, or Arab strap) is a ring worn around the penis, usually at the base.The primary purpose of wearing a cock ring is to restrict the flow of blood from the erect penis to produce a stronger erection or to maintain an erection for a longer period of time.Medically, they are sometimes used on their own, or in conjunction with a penis pump to assist in the management of erectile dysfunction.Genital adornment is another purpose, as is repositioning the genitals to provide an enhanced appearance..When used in cases of erectile dysfunction (ED), they are known by various other names, such as erection rings and tension rings..Cock rings worn just behind the corona of the glans of the penis are known as glans rings, head rings or cock crowns.A ring that is worn around the penis and scrotum is also usually called a cock ring, but is sometimes referred to as a cock and ball ring.Rings that are worn just around the scrotum, in order to hold the testicles, are usually called testicle cuffs or ball stretchers..The purpose of a cock ring is to trap blood inside the penis in order to maintain an erection, or encourage a stronger erection.In order to do this, it must be placed at the base of the penis..A ring made of stretchy material is stretched over the penis (and optionally also the scrotum, except when used with a pump for impotence) and situated against the body.Rigid rings are used differently: first each testicle is fed through the ring and the entire scrotum is pulled through, then the flaccid penis is pushed through the ring and the ring is situated against the body.[1].", "Major league baseball": "Major League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball organization.One of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, MLB comprises 30 teams, divided equally between the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), with 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada.Formed in 1876 and 1901, respectively, the NL and AL cemented their cooperation with the National Agreement in 1903, making MLB the oldest major professional sports league in the world.They remained legally separate entities until 2000, when they merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball.[3][7][17][18] MLB is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.[7].Baseball's first all-professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was founded in 1869.The first few decades of professional baseball saw rivalries between leagues, and players often jumped from one team or league to another.The period before 1920 was the dead-ball era, when home runs were rarely hit.Professional baseball survived the Black Sox Scandal, a conspiracy to fix the 1919 World Series, then rose in popularity in the following decade.It survived the Great Depression and World War II.Shortly after the war, Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier..The 1950s and 1960s saw the AL and NL add clubs; some moved around the country.Modern stadiums with artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s.", "Delaware": "Delaware (/\u02c8d\u025bl\u0259w\u025b\u0259r/ \u24d8 DEL-\u0259-wair)[11] is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.[12] It borders Maryland to its south and west, Pennsylvania to its north, New Jersey to its northeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east.The state's name derives from the adjacent Delaware Bay, which in turn was named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and the Colony of Virginia's first colonial-era governor.[13].Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula, and some islands and territory within the Delaware River.It is the 2nd smallest and 6th least populous state, but also the 6th most densely populated.Delaware's most populous city is Wilmington, and the state's capital is Dover, the 2nd most populous city in Delaware.The state is divided into three counties, the fewest number of counties of any of the 50 U.S.states;[b] from north to south, the three counties are: New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County..The southern two counties, Kent and Sussex counties, historically have been predominantly agrarian economies/ New Castle is more urbanized and is considered part of the Delaware Valley metropolitan statistical area that surrounds and includes Philadelphia, the nation's 6th most populous city.Delaware is considered part of the Southern United States by the U.S.Census Bureau, but the state's geography, culture, and history are a hybrid of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the country.[14].Before Delaware coastline was explored and developed by Europeans in the 16th century, the state was inhabited by several Native Americans tribes, including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south.The state was first colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael, near present-day Lewes, Delaware, in 1631..", "Energy transformation": "Energy transformation, also known as energy conversion, is the process of changing energy from one form to another.[1] In physics, energy is a quantity that provides the capacity to perform work or moving (e.g.lifting an object) or provides heat.In addition to being converted, according to the law of conservation of energy, energy is transferable to a different location or object, but it cannot be created or destroyed..The energy in many of its forms may be used in natural processes, or to provide some service to society such as heating, refrigeration, lighting or performing mechanical work to operate machines.For example, to heat a home, the furnace burns fuel, whose chemical potential energy is converted into thermal energy, which is then transferred to the home's air to raise its temperature..Conversions to thermal energy from other forms of energy may occur with 100% efficiency.[2][self-published source?] Conversion among non-thermal forms of energy may occur with fairly high efficiency, though there is always some energy dissipated thermally due to friction and similar processes.Sometimes the efficiency is close to 100%, such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in a vacuum.This also applies to the opposite case; for example, an object in an elliptical orbit around another body converts its kinetic energy (speed) into gravitational potential energy (distance from the other object) as it moves away from its parent body.When it reaches the furthest point, it will reverse the process, accelerating and converting potential energy into kinetic.Since space is a near-vacuum, this process has close to 100% efficiency..Thermal energy is unique because it in most cases (willow) cannot be converted to other forms of energy.Only a difference in the density of thermal/heat energy (temperature) can be used to perform work, and the efficiency of this conversion will be (much) less than 100%.", "List of amendments to the United States Constitution": "Thirty-three amendments to the Constitution of the United States have been proposed by the United States Congress and sent to the states for ratification since the Constitution was put into operation on March 4, 1789.Twenty-seven of those, having been ratified by the requisite number of states, are part of the Constitution.The first ten amendments were adopted and ratified simultaneously and are known collectively as the Bill of Rights.The 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments are collectively known as the Reconstruction Amendments.Six amendments adopted by Congress and sent to the states have not been ratified by the required number of states.Four of those amendments are still pending, one is closed and has failed by its own terms, and one is closed and has failed by the terms of the resolution proposing it.All 27 ratified and six unratified amendments are listed and detailed in the tables below..Article Five of the United States Constitution details the two-step process for amending the nation's plan of government.Amendments must be properly proposed and ratified before becoming operative.This process was designed to strike a balance between the excesses of constant change and inflexibility.[1].An amendment may be proposed and sent to the states for ratification by either:.To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the states (38 since 1959) by either (as determined by Congress):.", "Fidelity Investments": "Fidelity Investments, commonly referred to as Fidelity, earlier as Fidelity Management & Research or FMR, is an American multinational financial services corporation based in Boston, Massachusetts.The company was established in 1946 and is one of the largest asset managers in the world with $4.3 trillion in assets under management, and, as of December 2022, their assets under administration amount to $10.3 trillion.[6] Fidelity Investments operates a brokerage firm, manages a large family of mutual funds, provides fund distribution and investment advice, retirement services, index funds, wealth management, securities execution and clearance, asset custody, and life insurance.[7].The \"Fidelity Fund\" became Fidelity Investments under  Edward C.Johnson II; incorporated in Massachusetts, May 1, 1930.During the Great Depression, the \"Fidelity Fund\" was the only fund approved by.John C.Hull in his term in office as Securities Director for Massachusetts because of widespread  bank failures in 1930.[8] The corporate structure changed in 1946; it is  now known as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR).[1].In 1969, the company formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S.markets and subsequently spun it off in 1980 into an independent entity owned by its employees.[9].In 1982, FMR company started offering 401(k) products.[1] In 1984, it offered computerized stock trading.[1].In 1997, Robert Pozen was named

behavior, patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and aspects of culture associated with everyday life.More simply put, sociology is the scientific study of society.[1][2][3] It uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis[4]:\u200a3\u20135\u200a to develop a body of knowledge about social order and social change.[4]:\u200a32\u201340\u200a While some sociologists conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes and phenomenological method.Subject matter can range from micro-level analyses of society (i.e.of individual interaction and agency) to macro-level analyses (i.e.of social systems and social structure).[5].Traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, sexuality, gender, and deviance.As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects and institutions, such as health and the institution of medicine; economy; military; punishment and systems of control; the Internet; sociology of education; social capital; and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge..The range of social scientific methods has also expanded, as social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques.The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-20th century, especially, have led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophical approaches towards the analysis of society.Conversely, the turn of the 21st century has seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically, and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis.[6][7].Social research has influence throughout various industries and sectors of life, such as among politicians, policy makers, and legislators; educators; planners; administrators; developers; business magnates and managers; social workers; non-governmental organizations; and non-profit organizations, as well as individuals interested in resolving social issues in general.As such, there is often a great deal of crossover between social research, market research, and other statistical fields.[8].", "Thunder": "Thunder is the sound caused by lightning.[1][2][3] Depending upon the distance from and nature of the lightning, it can range from a long, low rumble to a sudden, loud crack.The sudden increase in temperature and hence pressure caused by the lightning produces rapid expansion of the air in the path of a lightning bolt.[4] In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, often referred to as a \"thunderclap\" or \"peal of thunder\".The scientific study of thunder is known as brontology and the irrational fear (phobia) of thunder is called brontophobia..The d in Modern English thunder (from earlier Old English \u00feunor) is epenthetic, and is now found as well in Modern Dutch donder (cf.Middle Dutch donre; also Old Norse \u00feorr, Old Frisian \u00feuner, Old High German donar, all ultimately descended from Proto-Germanic *\u00feunraz).In Latin the term was tonare \"to thunder\".The name of the Nordic god Thor comes from the Old Norse word for thunder.[5].The shared Proto-Indo-European root is *t\u00f3n-r\u0325 or *tar-, also found in Gaulish Taranis.[6].The cause of thunder has been the subject of centuries of speculation and scientific inquiry.[7] Early thinking was that it was made by deities, but the ancient Greek philosophers attributed it to natural causes, such as wind striking clouds (Anaximander, Aristotle) and movement of air within clouds (Democritus).[8] The Roman philosopher Lucretius held it was from the sound of hail colliding within clouds.[8].In the mid-19th century, the accepted theory was that lightning produced a vacuum and that the collapse of that vacuum produced what is known as thunder.[7].In the 20th century a consensus evolved that thunder must begin with a shock wave in the air due to the sudden thermal expansion of the plasma in the lightning channel.[9][8] The temperature inside the lightning channel, measured by spectral analysis, varies during its 50 \u03bcs existence, rising sharply from an initial temperature of about 20,000K to about 30,000K, then dropping away gradually to about 10,000K.The average is about 20,400K (20,100\u00b0C; 36,300\u00b0F).[10] This heating causes a rapid outward expansion, impacting the surrounding cooler air at a speed faster than sound would otherwise travel.", "Palma, Majorca": "Palma (Catalan: [\u02c8palm\u0259]; Spanish: [\u02c8palma]), also known as Palma de Mallorca (officially between 1983 and 1988, 2006\u201308, and 2012\u201316),[3] is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands in Spain.[4] It is situated on the south coast of Mallorca on the Bay of Palma.The Cabrera Archipelago, though widely separated from Palma proper, is administratively considered part of the municipality.As of 2022[update], Palma Airport serves over 28 million passengers per year..Palma was founded as a Roman camp upon the remains of a Talaiotic settlement.The city was subjected to several Vandal raids during the fall of the Western Roman Empire, then reconquered by the Byzantine Empire, then colonised by the Moors (who called it Medina Mayurqa) and, in the 13th century, by James I of Aragon..After the conquest of Mallorca, the city was loosely incorporated into the province of Tarraconensis by 123 BC; the Romans founded two new cities: Palma on the south of the island, and Pollentia in the northeast \u2013 on the site of a Phoenician settlement.Whilst Pollentia acted as a port to Roman cities on the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, Palma was the port used for destinations in Africa, such as Carthage, and Hispania, such as Saguntum, Gades and Carthago Nova.Though present-day Palma has no significant remains from this period, occasional archaeological finds are made in city centre excavations.For example, the remains of the Roman Wall can be seen at Can Bordils, the Municipal Archive, and below it, at the Maim\u00f3 ben Faraig Center.[5].Though the period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Muslim conquest is not well understood (due to lack of documents), there is clear evidence of a Byzantine presence in the city, as indicated by mosaics found in the oldest parts of the cathedral, which was in early medieval times part of a paleo-Christian temple..Between 902 and 1229, the city was under Islamic control.It remained the capital of the island and it was known as Medina Mayurqa, which in Arabic means \"City of Majorca\"..", "Lex Luthor": "Alexander Joseph \"Lex\" Luthor (/\u02c8lu\u02d0\u03b8\u0254\u02d0r, -\u03b8\u0259r/) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.The character was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.Lex Luthor originally appeared in Action Comics #23 (cover dated: April 1940).He has since endured as the archnemesis of the superhero Superman.[1].Lex Luthor was depicted as a narcissistic and egotistical mad scientist from the 1960s to the mid-1980s.Since the mid-late 1980s, he has more often been portrayed as the power-mad CEO of LexCorp.He wishes to rid the world of Superman, ostensibly because he views Superman as a threat to humanity, but in reality envies Superman's popularity and influence.[2] Given his high profile as a supervillain, however, he has often come into conflict with Batman and other superheroes in the DC Universe.[3] Lex Luthor is physically an ordinary human and has no natural superpowers, but is a genius with a high aptitude for business and politics and a deep command of science and technology.He occasionally wears his Warsuit, a suit of mechanized armor that gives him enhanced strength, flight, advanced weaponry, and other capabilities.While Lex is primarily depicted as a supervillain allied with other villains, such as Metallo, Parasite and Bizarro, and frequently leading DC supervillain teams such as the Legion of Doom, he has also been portrayed as an antihero who will ally himself with Superman and other heroes when the situation calls for it.[4].The character was ranked 4th on IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time[5] and as the 8th Greatest Villain by Wizard on its 100 Greatest Villains of All Time list.[6] Luthor is one of a few genre-crossing villains whose adventures take place \"in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended\".[4] Scott James Wells, Sherman Howard, John Shea, Michael Rosenbaum, Jon Cryer, Titus Welliver, and Michael Cudlitz have portrayed the character in television series, while Lyle Talbot, Gene Hackman, Kevin Spacey, and Jesse Eisenberg have portrayed the character in films.Several actors have provided Luthor's voice in animated adaptations, including Clancy Brown, Mark Rolston, James Marsters, Giancarlo Esposito, and Marc Maron..In his first story appearance, Action Comics #23 (April 1940), Luthor is depicted as a diabolical genius and is referred to only by his surname.", "Martin Luther King, Jr. Day": "Martin Luther king.Death and memorial.Martin Luther King Jr.Day (officially Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.,[1] and often referred to shorthand as MLK Day) is a federal holiday in the United States marking the birthday of Martin Luther KingJr.It is observed on the third Monday of January each year.Born in 1929, King's actual birthday is January 15 (which in 1929 fell on a Tuesday).The holiday is similar to holidays set under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act.The earliest Monday for this holiday is January 15 and the latest is January 21..King was the chief spokesperson for nonviolent activism in the Civil Rights Movement, which protested racial discrimination in federal and state law.The campaign for a federal holiday in King's honor began soon after his assassination in 1968.President Ronald Reagan signed the holiday into law in 1983, and it was first observed three years later on January 20, 1986.At first, some states resisted observing the holiday as such, giving it alternative names or combining it with other holidays.", "Camera phone": "A camera phone is a mobile phone which is able to capture photographs and often record video using one or more built-in digital cameras.It can also send the resulting image wirelessly and conveniently.The first commercial phone with color camera was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210, released in Japan in May 1999.[1].Most camera phones are smaller and simpler than the separate digital cameras.In the smartphone era, the steady sales increase of camera phones caused point-and-shoot camera sales to peak about 2010 and decline thereafter.[2] The concurrent improvement of smartphone camera technology, and its other multifunctional benefits, have led to it gradually replacing compact point-and-shoot cameras.[3].Most modern smartphones only have a menu choice to start a camera application program and an on-screen button to activate the shutter.[4] Some also have a separate camera button, for quickness and convenience.A few such as the 2009 Samsung i8000 Omnia II have a two-level shutter button as in dedicated digital cameras.[5]  Some camera phones are designed to resemble separate low-end digital compact cameras in appearance and to some degree in features and picture quality, and are branded as both mobile phones and cameras\u2014an example being the 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom..The principal advantages of camera phones are cost and compactness; indeed for a user who carries a mobile phone anyway, the addition is negligible.Smartphones that are camera phones may run mobile applications to add capabilities such as geotagging and image stitching.Also, modern smartphones can use their touch screens to direct their camera to focus on a particular object in the field of view, giving even an inexperienced user a degree of focus control exceeded only by seasoned photographers using manual focus.However, the touch screen, being a general purpose control, lacks the agility of a separate camera's dedicated buttons and dial(s)..Starting in the mid-2010s, some advanced camera phones feature optical image stabilisation (OIS), larger sensors, bright lenses, 4K video and even optical zoom, for which a few use a physical zoom lens.", "Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?": "\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\" is a 1986 American comic book story published by DC Comics, featuring the superhero Superman.Written by British author Alan Moore with help from long-time Superman editor Julius Schwartz, the story was published in two parts, beginning in Superman #423 and ending in Action Comics #583, both published in September 1986.The story was drawn by long-time artist Curt Swan in one of his final major contributions to the Superman titles and was inked by George P\u00e9rez in the issue of Superman and Kurt Schaffenberger in the issue of Action Comics.The story was an imaginary story which told the final tale of the Silver Age Superman and his long history,[1] which was being rebooted following the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, before his modern introduction in the John Byrne series, The Man of Steel..Moore wanted his plot to honor the long history of the character and to serve as a complete conclusion to his mythology.[2] The story is a frame story set 10 years after Superman was last seen, where Lois Lane recounts the tale of the end of Superman's career to a reporter from the Daily Planet.Her story includes numerous violent attacks against Superman by his enemies, the public revelation of his secret identity of Clark Kent and a number of deaths of those closest to him..The story has been cited as one of the best stories of the character of Superman[3][4][5][6] and critics and audiences frequently choose it as one of the most memorable comics ever published.[7] It is used as an example of how to close the long-time continuity of a comic book character.The story's legacy has endured with similar stories written as tributes to it.The title is a reference to one of the nicknames of Superman as the Man of Tomorrow and was later again used in the title of another Superman comic book series..In the DC Multiverse, this story takes place on Earth-423 (a reference to Superman #423, the comic issue which launched the story)..The comic book Action Comics #1, published in April 1938 by National Allied Publications (later renamed DC Comics), marked the first publication of the character of Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.The comic quickly became a success and its editor soon realized that it was because of the popularity of the character.[8] In an unprecedented move at the time, National Allied Publications introduced a second comic book, Superman, exclusively featuring the popular character.[9].", "Eucharist in the Catholic Church": "Eucharist (Koin\u0113 Greek: \u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, romanized:evcharist\u00eda, lit.\u2009'thanksgiving')[1] is the name that Catholics give to the sacrament by which, according to their belief, the body and blood of Christ are present in the bread and wine that are consecrated during the Catholic eucharistic liturgy, generally known as the Mass.[2] The definition of the Eucharist in the 1983 Code of Canon Law as the sacrament where Christ himself \"is contained, offered, and received\" points to the three aspects of the Eucharist according to Catholic theology: the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, Holy Communion, and the holy sacrifice of the Mass.[3].The name \"Eucharist\" comes from the Greek word \"eucharistia\" which means \"thanksgiving\" and which refers to the accounts of the last supper in Matthew 26:26-28, Mark 14:22-24, Luke 22:19-20 and I Corinthians11:23-29, all of which narrate that Jesus \"gave thanks\" as he took the bread and the wine.[2].The term Mass refers to the act by which the sacrament of the Eucharist comes into being, while the term Holy Communion refers to the act by which the Eucharist is received.[2].Blessed Sacrament is a devotional term used in the Catholic Church to refer to the Eucharistic species (consecrated sacramental bread and wine) .[4] Consecrated hosts are kept in a tabernacle after Mass, so that the Blessed Sacrament can be brought to the sick and dying outside the time of Mass.[5] This makes possible also the practice of eucharistic adoration.[5].Certain passages of the Old Testament are said to  refer to remote preparations for, or prefigurations of, the institution of the Holy Eucharist.These are the passages regarding the offering by Melchizedek (Gen.14:18-20),[6] the sacrifice of the Covenant on Mt.Sinai (Ex.24:3-8), the manna in the desert during the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land (Ex.16:2-4), the bread from heaven that strengthened Elijah (1 Kings 19:4-8), the banquet of Wisdom (Prov.9:1-6), the prophecy of Malachi (Ml.1:11),[6] the paschal lamb (Ex.", "List of colleges and universities in Louisiana": "The following is a list of colleges and universities in the U.S.state of Louisiana.[1].\u2020 two-year colleges, not named

story": "A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can typically be read in a single sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a single effect or mood.The short story is one of the oldest types of literature and has existed in the form of legends, mythic tales, folk tales, fairy tales, tall tales, fables and anecdotes in various ancient communities around the world.The modern short story developed in the early 19th century.[1].The short story is a crafted form in its own right.Short stories make use of plot, resonance and other dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a lesser degree.While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or novella/short novel, authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.[citation needed] The short story is sometimes referred to as a genre.[2].Determining what exactly defines a short story has been recurrently problematic.[3] A classic definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in Edgar Allan Poe's essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\" (1846).[4] H.G.Wells described the purpose of the short story as \"The jolly art, of making something very bright and moving; it may be horrible or pathetic or funny or profoundly illuminating, having only this essential, that it should take from fifteen to fifty minutes to read aloud.\"[5] According to William Faulkner, a short story is character-driven and a writer's job is to \"...trot along behind him with a paper and pencil trying to keep up long enough to put down what he says and does.\"[6].Some authors have argued that a short story must have a strict form.Somerset Maugham thought that the short story \"must have a definite design, which includes a point of departure, a climax and a point of test; in other words, it must have a plot\".[5] Hugh Walpole had a similar view: \"A story should be a story; a record of things happening full of incidents, swift movements, unexpected development, leading through suspense to a climax and a satisfying denouement.\"[5].This view of the short story as a finished product of art is however opposed by Anton Chekov, who thought that a story should have neither a beginning nor an end.It should just be a \"slice of life\", presented suggestively.", "Area code 810": "Area code 810 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan for the east-central part in the U.S.state of Michigan.The numbering plan area (NPA) comprises the cities of Flint, Lapeer, Port Huron, and the southern portion of the Thumb..Area code 810 was split off from area code 313 on December 1, 1993, with a permissive dialing period that ended on August 10, 1994.[1] The initial numbering plan area included the counties of Oakland, Macomb, Genesee, Lapeer, St.Clair, and Sanilac as well as small sections of Saginaw, Shiawassee, Livingston, Washtenaw, and Wayne counties north of Detroit.Most of Washtenaw County, all of Monroe County, and the southern and western portions of Wayne County (including the City of Detroit) remained in the 313 area code.The split created Michigan's first new area code since 1961..By 1994, demand for telephone numbers increased such that there were plans for a new area code.[2] Ameritech once again applied to the North American Numbering Plan Administrator for additional relief.As a result, Oakland County received the new area code 248, with a start of permissive dialing on May 10, 1997.[3] Thus, the Oakland County numbering plan area was surrounded on three sides by area code 810, with 313 to the south..Then, only four years after splitting off area code 248, continued demand in the area necessitated the Michigan Public Service Commission to request another relief code, creating yet another numbering plan area in southeastern Michigan.Area code 586 was assigned to the eleven rate centers that comprise Macomb County, including Mt.Clemens, Roseville, Warren and Utica.", "Raccoon": "The raccoon (/r\u0259\u02c8ku\u02d0n/ or US: /r\u00e6\u02c8ku\u02d0n/ \u24d8, Procyon lotor), also spelled racoon[3] and sometimes called the common raccoon to distinguish it from other species, is a mammal native to North America.It is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70cm (16 to 28in), and a body weight of 5 to 26kg (11 to 57lb).Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur, which insulates it against cold weather.Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas relating to the animal.The raccoon is noted for its intelligence, as studies show that it is able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years.It is usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebrates..The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests, but due to their adaptability, they have extended their range to mountainous areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas, where some homeowners consider them to be pests.As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across central Europe, the Caucasus, and Japan..In Europe, the raccoon is included since 2016 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list).[4] This implies that this species cannot be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.[5].Though previously thought to be generally solitary, there is now evidence that raccoons engage in sex-specific social behavior.Related females often share a common area, while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four raccoons in order to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season and against other potential invaders.Home range sizes vary anywhere from 3ha (7.4 acres) for females in cities, to 5,000ha (12,000 acres) for males in prairies.", "2010 Haiti earthquake": "The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a catastrophic magnitude 7.0Mw earthquake that struck Haiti at 16:53 local time (21:53 UTC) on Tuesday, 12 January 2010.[8][9] The epicenter was near the town of L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, Ouest department, approximately 25 kilometres (16mi) west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital..By 24 January, at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded.[10] An estimated three million people were affected by the quake.[11] Death toll estimates range from 100,000[5] to about 160,000[7] to Haitian government figures from 220,000[12][13] to 316,000,[5] although these latter figures are a matter of some dispute.[6] The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged.[14] The nation's history of national debt, prejudicial trade policies by other countries, and foreign intervention into national affairs contributed to the existing poverty and poor housing conditions that increased the death toll from the disaster.[15].The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and other cities in the region.Notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the main jail.Among those killed were Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Joseph Serge Miot,[16] and opposition leader Micha Gaillard.[17][18] The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), located in the capital, collapsed, killing many, including the Mission's Chief, H\u00e9di Annabi.[19][20].Many countries responded to appeals for humanitarian aid, pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams, engineers and support personnel.The most-watched telethon in history aired on 22 January, called \"Hope for Haiti Now,\" raising US$58 million by the next day.[21] Communication systems, air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake, which hampered rescue and aid efforts; confusion over who was in charge, air traffic congestion, and problems with prioritising flights further complicated early relief work.Port-au-Prince's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies.These had to be buried in mass graves.[22].As rescues tailed off, supplies, medical care and sanitation became priorities.Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors, and looting and sporadic violence were observed.On 22 January, the United Nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close, and on the following day, the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors..", "Mister Ed": "Mister Ed is an American television sitcom produced by Filmways[1] that aired in syndication from January 5 to July 2, 1961, and then on CBS from October 1, 1961, to February 6, 1966.[2] The show's title character is a talking horse which originally appeared in short stories by Walter R.Brooks..Mister Ed is one of the few series to debut in syndication and be picked up by a major network for prime time.[3] All 143 episodes were filmed in black and white.[2].The Mister Ed show concept was derived from a series of short stories by children's author Walter R.Brooks which began with The Talking Horse in the September 18, 1937, issue of Liberty magazine.[4] Brooks is best known for the Freddy the Pig series of children's novels which feature talking animals that interact with humans.Arthur Lubin's secretary Sonia Chernus introduced him to the Brooks stories and is credited with developing the concept for television..The show's concept resembles that of the Francis the Talking Mule movies in which an equine character talks to only one person, thus causing a variety of opportunities and frustrations.The first six Francis films (1950\u201355) were also directed by Lubin.[5] He wanted to make a Francis television series but had been unable to secure the rights, so he optioned the Brooks' stories for television.[6] Comedian George Burns financed the pilot for Mister Ed, which was shot at his McCadden Studio in Hollywood at a cost of $70,000.[6] Scott McKay played Wilbur.Jack Benny was also involved behind the scenes.[7].Lubin was unable to sell the show to a network, so he decided to sell it into syndication first.He managed to get single-sponsor identification for the program on over 100 stations.The show was recast with Alan Young in the lead.", "Rapture": "The Rapture is an eschatological position held by some Christians, particularly those of American evangelicalism, consisting of an end-time event when all dead Christian believers will be resurrected and, joined with Christians who are still alive, together will rise \"in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.\"[1] The origin of the term extends from the First Epistle to the Thessalonians in the Bible, which uses the Greek word harpazo (Ancient Greek: \u1f01\u03c1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9), meaning \"to snatch away\" or \"to seize\".This view of eschatology is referred to as dispensational premillennialism, a form of futurism that considers various prophecies in the Bible as remaining unfulfilled and occurring in the future..The idea of a rapture as it is currently defined is not found in historic Christianity, and is a relatively recent doctrine originating from the 1830s.The term is used frequently among fundamentalist theologians in the United States.[2] Rapture has also been used for a mystical union with God or for eternal life in Heaven.[2].Differing viewpoints exist about the exact timing of the rapture and whether Christ's return would occur in one event or two.Pretribulationism distinguishes the rapture from the second coming of Jesus Christ mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew, 2 Thessalonians, and Revelation.This view holds that the rapture would precede the seven-year Tribulation, which would culminate in Christ's second coming and be followed by a thousand-year Messianic Kingdom.[3][4] This theory grew out of the translations of the Bible that John Nelson Darby analyzed in 1833.Pretribulationism is the most widely held view among Christians believing in the rapture today, although this view is disputed within evangelicalism.[5] Some assert a post-tribulational rapture..Most Christian denominations do not subscribe to rapture theology and have a different interpretation of the aerial gathering described in 1 Thessalonians 4.[6] They do not use rapture as a specific theological term, nor do they generally subscribe to the premillennial dispensational views associated with its use.[7] Instead they typically interpret rapture in the sense of the elect gathering with Christ in Heaven right after his second coming and reject the idea that a large segment of humanity will be left behind on earth for an extended tribulation period after the events of 1 Thessalonians 4:17.[6][8].Rapture is derived from Middle French rapture, via the Medieval Latin raptura (\"seizure, kidnapping\"), which derives from the Latin raptus (\"a carrying off\").[9].The Koine Greek of 1 Thessalonians 4:17 uses the verb form \u1f01\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 (harpag\u0113sometha), which means \"we shall be caught up\" or \"we shall be taken away\".The dictionary form of this Greek verb is harpaz\u014d (\u1f01\u03c1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9).[10] This use is also seen in such texts as Acts 8:39,[11] 2 Corinthians 12:2\u20134,[12] and Revelation 12:5.[13] Linguist, Dr.", "Kris Humphries": "Kristopher Nathan Humphries[1] (born February 6, 1985) is an American retired professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA).He played in the NBA for the Utah Jazz, Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks, New Jersey / Brooklyn Nets, Boston Celtics, Washington Wizards, Phoenix Suns, and the Atlanta Hawks.Humphries played college basketball for the Minnesota Golden Gophers of the University of Minnesota, and for the United States men's national basketball team..Humphries was born in Minnesota to Debra and William Humphries.His father was a football player at the University of Minnesota.[2] Humphries is half African-American from his father.[3] He has two older sisters, Krystal and Kaela.His first success in sports came in competitive swimming, where he was the top 10-year-old in the nation in six events, first, beating young Michael Phelps in the remaining events.Kris Humphries held the US national record for the 50-meter freestyle for 10 and under boys for 18 years until it was recently broken.[4] At age 12, he gave up swimming to pursue a career in basketball..Humphries attended Hopkins High School, where he led the team to a 25\u20132 record in 2002 and its first Minnesota state championship in 49 years.[2] He was named a 2003 McDonald's All-American and named Second Team All-USA by USA Today.[5] He was also named to the Super 25 Basketball Team by USA Today, named Minnesota Mr.Basketball, and state player of the year by the Minneapolis Star Tribune and College Basketball News.[5] He was one of 10 finalists for the 2003 Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award, averaging a double-double in his final three seasons, averaging 25.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, and 5.0 assists a game as a senior.[5].Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Humphries was listed as the No.2 power forward and the No.15 player in the nation in 2003.[6].", "Philistines": "The Philistines (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd\u200e, romanized:P\u0259l\u012b\u0161t\u012bm; Koine Greek (LXX): \u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b5\u03af\u03bc, romanized: Phulistie\u00edm) were an ancient people who lived on the south coast of Canaan during the Iron Age.The Philistines originated as an immigrant group from the Aegean that settled in Canaan circa 1175 BC, during the Late Bronze Age collapse.Over time, they gradually assimilated elements of the indigenous Semitic Levantine societies while preserving their own unique culture.[1] In 604 BC, the Philistine polity, after having already been subjugated for centuries by the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911\u2013605 BC), was finally destroyed by King Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.[2] After becoming part of his empire and its successor, the Persian Empire, the Philistines lost their distinct ethnic identity and disappeared as a people from the historical and archaeological record by the late 5th century BC.[3].The Philistines are known for their biblical conflict with the Canaanite peoples of the region, in particular the Israelites.Though the primary source of information about the Philistines is the Hebrew Bible, they are first attested to in reliefs at the Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu, in which they are called Peleset[a] (accepted as cognate with Hebrew Peleshet);[4] the parallel Assyrian term is Palastu,[b] Pili\u0161ti,[c] or Pilistu.[d][5] They also left behind a distinctive material culture.[1].The English term Philistine comes from Old French Philistin; from Classical Latin Philistinus; from Late Greek Philistinoi; ultimately from Hebrew P\u0259li\u0161t\u012b (\u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9; plural P\u0259li\u0161t\u012bm, \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd), meaning 'people of P\u0259le\u0161e\u1e6f (\u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05ea)'; and there are cognates in Akkadian Palastu and Egyptian Palusata;[6] the term Palestine has the same derivation.[7] The native Philistine endonym is unknown..The Hebrew term P\u0259li\u0161t\u012bm occurs 286 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible (of which 152 times are in 1 Samuel).It also appears in the Samaritan Pentateuch.[8] In the Greek version of the Bible, called Septuagint, the equivalent term Phulistie\u00edm (\u03a6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b5\u03af\u03bc) occurs 12 times, again in the Pentateuch.[9].In secondary literature, \"Philistia\" is further mentioned in the Aramaic Visions of Amram (4Q543-7), which is dated \"prior to Antiochus IV and the Hasmonean revolt,\" possibly to the time of High Priest of Israel Onias II; Jubilees 46:1-47:1 might have used Amram as a source.[10].Outside of pre-Maccabean Israelite religious literature, evidence for the name and the origins of the Philistines is less abundant and less consistent.In the remainder of the Hebrew Bible, ha-P\u0259li\u0161t\u012bm is attested at Qumran for 2 Samuel 5:17.[11] In the Septuagint, however, 269 references instead use the term allophylos ('of another tribe').[12].During the Late Bronze Age collapse, an apparent confederation of seafarers known as the Sea Peoples are recorded as attacking ancient Egypt and other Eastern Mediterranean civilizations, while the Bronze Age collapse also saw large invasions, mass migrations and upheavals in Western Asia, Asia Minor, Caucasus, East Mediterranean and Balkans with only the powerful states of Assyria and Elam unaffected.[13] While their exact origins are a mystery, and probably diverse, it is generally agreed that the Sea Peoples had origins in the greater Southern European and West Asian area, including western Asia Minor, the Aegean, and the islands of the East Mediterranean.[14] Egypt, in particular, repelled numerous attempted invasions from the Sea Peoples, most famously at the Battle of the Delta (c.\u20091175BC),[15] where the pharaoh Ramesses III defeated a massive invasion force which had already plundered Hattusa, Carchemish, Cyprus, and the Southern Levant.", "Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery": "The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) is a multiple choice test, administered by the United States Military Entrance Processing Command, used to determine qualification for enlistment in the United States Armed Forces.It is often offered to U.S.high school students when they are in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade, though anyone eligible for enlistment may take it.[2].The ASVAB was first introduced in 1968 and was adopted by all branches of the military in 1976.It underwent a major revision in 2002.In 2004, the test's percentile rank scoring system was renormalized, to ensure that a score of 50% really did represent doing better than exactly 50% of the test takers..The ASVAB contains nine sections and takes three hours to complete.The duration of each section varies between 7 and 39 minutes, the longest being for Arithmetic Reasoning.The test is typically administered in a computerized format at Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) or in a written format at satellite locations called Military Entrance Test (MET) sites.Testing procedures vary depending on the mode of administration.[3].Navy applicants also complete a Coding Speed (CS) test..An Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score is used to determine basic qualifications for enlistment..", "Balance sheet": "In financial accounting, a balance sheet (also known as statement of financial position or statement of financial condition) is a summary of the financial balances of an individual or organization, whether it be a sole proprietorship, a business partnership, a corporation, private limited company or other organization such as government or not-for-profit entity.Assets, liabilities and ownership equity are listed as of a specific date, such as the end of its financial year.A balance sheet is often described as a \"snapshot of a company's financial condition\".[1]  It is the summary of each and every financial statement of an organization..Of the four basic financial statements, the balance sheet is the only statement which applies to a single point in time of a business's calendar year..A standard company balance sheet has two sides: assets on the left, and financing on the right\u2013which itself has two parts; liabilities and ownership equity.The main categories of assets are usually listed first, and typically in order of liquidity.[2] Assets are followed by the liabilities.The difference between the assets and the liabilities is known as equity or the net assets or the net worth or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation, net worth must equal assets minus liabilities.[3].Another way to look at the balance sheet equation is that total assets equals liabilities plus owner's equity.Looking at the equation in this way shows how assets were financed: either by borrowing money (liability) or by using the owner's money (owner's or shareholders' equity).Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections \"balancing\"..A business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period, plus any cash in hand.However, many businesses are not paid immediately; they build up inventories of goods and acquire buildings and equipment.", ".17 HMR": ".17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire, commonly known as the .17 HMR, is a rimfire rifle cartridge developed by Hornady[3] in 2002.It was developed  by necking down a .22 Magnum case to take a  .17 caliber (4.5mm) projectile.Commonly loaded with a 17 grain (1.1 g) projectile, it can deliver muzzle velocities in excess of 775m/s (2,650ft/s).[4].The .17 HMR round is similar to rounds developed by dedicated rimfire wildcatters who worked to create a rimfire cartridge with an exceptionally flat trajectory.These wildcatters were seeking to match the ballistics of the obsolete 5mm Remington Rimfire Magnum, which was made from 1970 to 1974, and was to that point the fastest rimfire cartridge ever produced.[5]  With 5 mm diameter barrels and bullets being virtually unavailable at the time (the 5mm RMR was the last commercial 5 mm round until the 2004 release of the centerfire .204 Ruger), the commercially available .17 caliber became their bullet of choice.The .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire  was the logical parent case, rather than the 5mm RMR (with its unique case head size, which requires a significantly different bolt and magazine) because it was commonly available, and it is a far larger and stronger case than the next largest, the .22 Long Rifle.The .17 caliber wildcats not only met but far exceeded the 5mm RMR's velocities and flat trajectory.The accuracy of these cartridges was also quite good.However, the downrange energy of the 5mm RMR is superior to both .22 WMR and .17 HMR, so there is still potential in the 5 mm rimfire for wildcatters.[6].Hornady, in conjunction with Marlin Firearms and Sturm, Ruger & Co.(manufacturers in the rimfire rifle market), followed much the same path.With the .22 WMR case as the starting point, a simple barrel change was sufficient for most .22 WMR firearms to chamber the new cartridge.", "Schaumburg Flyers": "The Schaumburg Flyers were a professional baseball team based in Schaumburg, Illinois, in the United States.The team played in the Northern League from 1999 to 2010, with their home games at Alexian Field, near the Elgin O'Hare Expressway.They formerly played in Thunder Bay, Ontario, where they were known as the Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks..The Flyers were also the first minor league baseball team to have several of their games aired on a major market radio station during their inaugural season of 1999, WMAQ AM 670 in Chicago.Three Sunday afternoon games were broadcast that first season..In 1999, the Flyers hired their first manager, Ron Kittle, best known for his playing days with the Chicago White Sox.The former Chicago Cubs and White Sox player Greg Hibbard was the pitching coach.Kittle did a series of TV commercials to promote the team, using the gimmick \"Ma Kittle,\" portraying both himself and his \"Ma.\"  The ads sparked interest as the Flyers hoped to steal away fans from the nearby Kane County Cougars.The campaign mimicked the highly successful Converse ads in which basketball star Larry Johnson starred as both himself and \"Gramama.\"  After the 2001 season, however, Kittle resigned as manager, with Jim Boynewicz hired to replace him..In 2004, the Flyers made it to the Northern League Championship Series against the St.Paul Saints.Despite leading the five-game series 2\u20131, Schaumburg eventually lost the championship.", "Rachel Weisz": "Rachel Hannah Weisz (/va\u026as/;[3] born 7 March 1970[note 1]) is a British actress.She began acting in stage and television

wheat flour.[1][2] It is cooked in a variety of ways, including baking it on a hot griddle or pan, or in an oven.It may be leavened or unleavened, and may have a variety of other ingredients baked into it.The ratio of potato to wheat flour varies significantly from recipe to recipe, with some recipes having a majority of potato, and others having a majority of wheat flour.Some recipes call for mashed potatoes, with others calling for dehydrated potato flakes.It is available as a commercial product in many countries, with similar variations in ingredients, cooking methods, and other variables..Potato bread goes by many regional names, including slims, fadge, potato cake, potato farls, and tatie bread in Ireland.\"Potato cake\" can actually refer to numerous dishes..Brazilian potato bread is usually a light airy bread, made in small round loaves with potatoes or potato flour mixed with wheat flour, milk, eggs and yeast and then baked.It can also be found with Catupiry filling and is usually consumed as a snack all over the country..Potato bread, in different forms, is a common element of the cuisine of Chilo\u00e9 in Southern Chile.The most popular breads are milcao and chapalele, which are part of the traditional curanto..Kartoffelbrot is a potato bread that may contain spelt and rye flour..", "Pacific Time Zone": "The Pacific Time Zone (PT) is a time zone encompassing parts of western Canada, the western United States, and western Mexico.Places in this zone observe standard time by subtracting eight hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC\u221208:00).During daylight saving time, a time offset of UTC\u221207:00 is used..In the United States and Canada, this time zone is generically called the Pacific Time Zone.Specifically, time in this zone is referred to as Pacific Standard Time (PST) when standard time is being observed (early November to mid-March), and Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) when daylight saving time (mid-March to early November) is being observed.In Mexico, the corresponding time zone is known as the Zona Noroeste (Northwest Zone) and observes the same daylight saving schedule as the United States and Canada.The largest city in the Pacific Time Zone is Los Angeles, whose metropolitan area is also the largest in the time zone..The zone is two hours ahead of the Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Time Zone, one hour ahead of the Alaska Time Zone, one hour behind the Mountain Time Zone,[a] two hours behind the Central Time Zone, three hours behind the Eastern Time Zone, and four hours behind the Atlantic Time Zone..One Canadian province is split between the Pacific Time Zone and the Mountain Time Zone:.The border between time zones in British Columbia was decided in a 1972 plebiscite held in northeastern and southeastern electoral districts due to their ties to neighboring Alberta.[1].As of September 24, 2020, Yukon officially switched from the Pacific Time Zone to a time zone \"to be reckoned as seven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC\u22127)\" after deciding to stop observing daylight saving time.[2].In Mexico, the Zona Noroeste, which corresponds to Pacific Time in the United States and Canada, includes:[citation needed].", "8-track tape": "The 8-track tape (formally Stereo 8; commonly called eight-track cartridge, eight-track tape, and eight-track) is a magnetic-tape sound recording technology that was popular[2] from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, when the compact cassette, which pre-dated the 8-track system, surpassed it in popularity for pre-recorded music.[3][4][5].The format was commonly used in cars and was most popular in the United States and Canada and, to a lesser extent, in the United Kingdom.[3][4][6] One advantage of the 8-track tape cartridge was that it could play continuously in an endless loop, and did not have to be ejected, turned around and reinserted to play the entire tape.After about 80 minutes of playing time, the tape would start again at the beginning.Because of the loop, there is no rewind.The only options the consumer has are play, fast forward, record, and program (track) change.[7].The Stereo 8 Cartridge was created in 1964 by a consortium led by Bill Lear, of Lear Jet Corporation,[8] along with Ampex, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Motorola, and RCA Victor Records (RCA - Radio Corporation of America)..The 8-track tape format is now considered obsolete, although there are collectors who refurbish these tapes and players as well as some bands that issue these tapes as a novelty.Cheap Trick's The Latest in 2009 was issued on 8-track, as was Dolly Parton's A Holly Dolly Christmas in 2020, the latter with an exclusive bonus track..The cartridge's dimensions are approximately 5.25 by 4 by 0.8 inches (13.3cm \u00d710.2cm \u00d72.0cm).The magnetic tape is played at 3\u20133/4 inches per second (twice the speed of a cassette), is wound around a single spool, is about 0.25 inches (0.64cm) wide and contains 8 parallel tracks.The player's head reads two of these tracks at a time, for stereo sound.After completing a program, the head mechanically switches to another set of two tracks, creating a characteristic clicking noise.[9].", "Ramesses II": "Ramesses II[a] (/\u02c8r\u00e6m\u0259si\u02d0z, \u02c8r\u00e6msi\u02d0z, \u02c8r\u00e6mzi\u02d0z/; Ancient Egyptian:

an Egyptian pharaoh.He was the third ruler of the Nineteenth Dynasty.Along with Thutmose III of the Eighteenth Dynasty, he is often regarded as the greatest, most celebrated, and most powerful pharaoh of the New Kingdom, which itself was the most powerful period of ancient Egypt.[8] He is also widely considered one of ancient Egypt's most successful warrior pharaohs, conducting no fewer than 15 military campaigns, all resulting in victories, excluding the Battle of Kadesh, generally considered a stalemate.[9].In ancient Greek sources, he is called Ozymandias,[c][10] derived from the first part of his Egyptian-language regnal name: Usermaatre Setepenre.[d][11] Ramesses was also referred to as the \"Great Ancestor\" by successor pharaohs and the Egyptian people..For the early part of his reign, he focused on building cities, temples, and monuments.After establishing the city of Pi-Ramesses in the Nile Delta, he designated it as Egypt's new capital and used it as the main staging point for his campaigns in Syria.Ramesses led several military expeditions into the Levant, where he reasserted Egyptian control over Canaan and Phoenicia; he also led a number of expeditions into Nubia, all commemorated in inscriptions at Beit el-Wali and Gerf Hussein.He celebrated an unprecedented thirteen or fourteen Sed festivals\u2014more than any other pharaoh.[12].Estimates of his age at death vary, though 90 or 91 is considered to be the most likely figure.[13][14] Upon his death, he was buried in a tomb (KV7) in the Valley of the Kings;[15] his body was later moved to the Royal Cache, where it was discovered by archaeologists in 1881.Ramesses' mummy is now on display at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization, located in the city of Cairo.[16].Ramesses II was born a civilian.His grandfather, Ramesses I, was a civilian military officer during the reign of pharaoh Horemheb, who appointed Ramesses I as his successor.", "Texas Rangers (baseball)": "The Texas Rangers are an American professional baseball team based in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.The Rangers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West division.In 2020, the Rangers moved to the new Globe Life Field in Arlington after having played at Globe Life Park (now Choctaw Stadium) from 1994 to 2019.The team's name derives from a historic law enforcement agency.[5].The franchise was established in 1961, as the Washington Senators, an expansion team awarded to Washington, D.C., after the city's first AL ballclub, the second Washington Senators, relocated to Minnesota and became the Twins (the original Washington Senators played primarily in the National League during the 1890s).After the 1971 season, the new Senators relocated to Arlington, and debuted as the Rangers the following spring..The Rangers have made nine appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a wild card team in both 2012 and 2023.Prior to 2010, the Rangers were the only team in the MLB to have never advanced past the first round of the playoffs.In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the division series for the first time, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays.The team then won their first American League pennant after beating the New York Yankees in six games.In the 2010 World Series, the franchise's first, the Rangers fell to the San Francisco Giants in five games.They repeated as American League champions the following year, but lost the 2011 World Series to the St.", "Julius caesar": "Gaius Julius Caesar (/\u02c8si\u02d0z\u0259r/, SEE-z\u0259r; Latin: [\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0i\u028as \u02c8ju\u02d0li\u028as \u02c8kae\u032fsar]; 12 July 100 BC \u2013 15 March 44 BC) was a Roman general and statesman.A member of the First Triumvirate, Caesar led the Roman armies in the Gallic Wars before defeating his political rival Pompey in a civil war, and subsequently became dictator from 49 BC until his assassination in 44 BC.He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire..In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, an informal political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years.Their attempts to amass political power were opposed by many in the Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the private support of Cicero.Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a string of military victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51BC, which greatly extended Roman territory.During this time he both invaded Britain and built a bridge across the river Rhine.These achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53BC.With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome.In 49 BC, Caesar openly defied the Senate's authority by crossing the Rubicon and marching towards Rome at the head of an army.[3] This began Caesar's civil war, which he won, leaving him in a position of near-unchallenged power and influence in 45 BC..After assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reform, including the creation of the Julian calendar.He gave citizenship to many residents of far regions of the Roman Republic.", "Languages of Nigeria": "There are over 525 native languages spoken in Nigeria.[1][2][3] The official language and most widely spoken lingua franca is English,[4][5] which was the language of Colonial Nigeria.Nigerian Pidgin \u2013 an English-based creole \u2013 is spoken by 30 million people in Nigeria.[5][6].The major native languages, in terms of population, are Hausa (over 80 million when including second-language, or L2, speakers), Yoruba (over 54 million, including L2 speakers), Igbo (over 42 million, including L2 speakers), Efik-Ibibio cluster (over 15 million), Fulfulde (13 million),  Kanuri (5 million), Tiv (5 million), Nupe (3 million) and approximately 2 to 3 million each of Karai-Karai Kupa, Kakanda, Edo, Igala, Idoma and [[Izon language Kamwe.|Izon]].[7] Nigeria's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of much of Africa as a whole, and the country contains languages from the three major African language families: Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan and Niger\u2013Congo.Nigeria also has several as-yet unclassified languages, such as Cent\u00fa\u00fam, which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families.[8].English is the single most widely spoken language in Nigeria, spoken by 60 million of the population.[9] It is the main lingua franca of the country and there are a growing number of sole English speakers due to rapid urbanisation and globalisation.[10] English remains the official language and is the major language of communication in government, business and education.[10] Furthermore, the national anthem, constitution and pledge are written in English.Almost all mass media transmit information in English.[11] English became the official language when Nigeria was created from diverse national groups by the British Empire.[11] Despite decolonisation, Nigeria chose to make English the official language to promote national cultural unity[12] and so not to favour any particular native language.[11].Despite its status, English is not widely spoken in rural areas.[13] Many Nigerians struggle with English, evidenced by the 60 percent fail rate of the WASSCE in English (May/June 2015), an important exam certificate.[10] Nevertheless, many Nigerians hold negative social attitudes towards the country's native languages, combining to lead to the neglect of Nigeria's many native languages.As such, there are fears from prominent linguists that Nigerian native languages are endangered and face eventual extinction.[11].Many Nigerians speak Nigerian Pidgin, a creole language based on English, which has replaced the native language for many Nigerians.Pidgin is a popular social and cultural language.[11] It has become popular in the mass media and in political slogans.[14][15][11] According to a 2012 study, the replacement of native local languages with Pidgin is inevitable in the areas studied.[16].The Afroasiatic languages of Nigeria are divided into Chadic, Semitic and Berber.[17] Among these categories, Chadic languages predominate, with more than 700 languages.", "Daucus carota": "Daucus carota, whose common names include wild carrot,[3] European wild carrot, bird's nest, bishop's lace, and Queen Anne's lace (North America), is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.It is native to temperate regions of the Old World and was naturalized in the New World..Domesticated carrots are cultivars of a subspecies, Daucus carota subsp.sativus..The wild carrot is a herbaceous, somewhat variable biennial plant that grows between 30 and 120cm (1 and 4ft) tall,[4][5] and is roughly hairy, with a stiff, solid stem.The leaves are tripinnate, finely divided and lacy, and overall triangular in shape.The leaves are 5\u201315cm (2\u20136in) long,[5] bristly and alternate in a pinnate pattern that separates into thin segments.The flowers are small and dull white, clustered in flat, dense umbels.The umbels are terminal and about 8\u201315cm (3\u20136in) wide.[6][5] They may be pink in bud and may have a reddish or purple[7] flower in the centre of the umbel.The lower bracts are three-forked or pinnate, which distinguishes the plant from other white-flowered umbellifers.As the seeds develop, the umbel curls up at the edges, becomes more congested, and develops a concave surface.The fruits are small, dry, bumpy, oval and flattened, with short styles and hooked spines, as well as protective hairs surrounding it.[8][6] The fruit has two mericarps, or bicarpellate.", "Nelly Furtado": "Nelly Kim Furtado ComIH (/f\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0do\u028a/; Portuguese: [fu\u027e\u02c8ta\u00f0u]; born December 2, 1978) is a Canadian singer and songwriter.She has sold over 45 million records, including 35 million in album sales worldwide[6] making her one of the most successful Canadian artists.Critics have noted Furtado's musical versatility and experimentation with genres.[7][8][9][10].Furtado first gained fame with her trip hop-inspired debut album, Whoa, Nelly! (2000), which was a critical and commercial success that spawned two top-10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, \"I'm Like a Bird\" and \"Turn Off the Light\".The former won her a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.Furtado's introspective folk-heavy 2003 second album, Folklore, explored her Portuguese roots.Its singles received moderate success in Europe, but the album's underperformance compared to her debut was regarded as a sophomore slump..Furtado's third album, Loose (2006), was a smash hit and became her bestselling album, with more than 10 million copies sold worldwide, also making it one of the bestselling albums of the 2000s.[11][12] Considered a radical image reinvention, the album spawned four successful number-one singles worldwide: \"Promiscuous\" (featuring Timbaland), \"Maneater\", \"Say It Right\", and \"All Good Things (Come to an End)\".Her 2007 feature on Timbaland's \"Give It to Me\" in the same era also topped the charts in the US and overseas.Furtado's critically acclaimed duet with James Morrison, \"Broken Strings\", also topped the charts in Europe in 2008.[13].She released her first Spanish-language album, Mi Plan, in 2009, which won her a Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album.In 2012, Furtado released her nostalgia-inspired fifth album The Spirit Indestructible.", "Creatures of the Night": "Creatures of the Night is the tenth studio album by American rock band Kiss, released in 1982.It was the band's last for Casablanca Records, the only label for which Kiss had recorded up to that point.The album was dedicated to the memory of Casablanca founder and early Kiss supporter Neil Bogart,[3] who had died of cancer during the recording sessions.It is also the band's last album recorded with Ace Frehley credited as an official member and their first album with Vinnie Vincent, as the initially uncredited lead guitarist.Vincent would later be credited but not featured on the cover of the 1985 reissue of the album.It was also Kiss' last album to feature the band with their trademark makeup until the release Psycho Circus in 1998..By 1982, Kiss's popularity in the US had plummeted due to changing musical tastes and their move away from the anthemic hard rock of their earlier material.1979's Dynasty, while commercially successful, alienated many fans with the disco-flavored track \"I Was Made for Lovin' You.\" 1980's Unmasked fell further into a pop rock/power pop oriented sound and was Kiss's first album not to achieve platinum status since 1975's Dressed to Kill.The band did not even tour the US for Unmasked, and it also soon faced its first lineup change: founding member Peter Criss, who had not participated in any of the Unmasked recording sessions, officially left Kiss in 1980 and was replaced by Eric Carr.[4][5].Fan hopes were raised in 1980 when Kiss announced that they were going to record their heaviest record yet.Instead, the band released Music from \"The Elder\" in late 1981, a concept album originally intended to complement a film called The Elder that was ultimately never filmed.Despite confidence from producer Bob Ezrin that this would recreate the success from 1976's Destroyer, the album did not improve the band's status, and on the contrary, further diminished Kiss' US fanbase, failed to achieve gold status, and having cancelled their US Unmasked Tour just a short time before, the band then called off the planned tour for Music from \"The Elder.\"[4].", "Somatosensory system": "In physiology, the somatosensory system is the network of neural structures in the brain and body that produce the perception of touch (haptic perception), as well as temperature (thermoception), body position (proprioception), and pain.[1] It is a subset of the sensory nervous system, which also represents visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli..Somatosensation begins when mechano- and thermosensitive structures in the skin or internal organs sense physical stimuli such as pressure on the skin (see mechanotransduction, nociception).Activation of these structures, or receptors, leads to activation of peripheral sensory neurons that convey signals to the spinal cord as patterns of action potentials.Sensory information is then processed locally in the spinal cord to drive reflexes, and is also conveyed to the brain for conscious perception of touch and proprioception.Note, somatosensory information from the face and head enters the brain through peripheral sensory neurons in the cranial nerves, such as the trigeminal nerve..The neural pathways that go to the brain are structured such that information about the location of the physical stimulus is preserved.In this way, neighboring neurons in the somatosensory cerebral cortex in the brain represent nearby locations on the skin or in the body, creating a map, also called a cortical homunculus..The four mechanoreceptors in the skin  each respond to different stimuli for short or long periods..Merkel cell nerve endings are found in the basal epidermis and hair follicles; they react to low vibrations (5\u201315Hz) and deep static touch such as shapes and edges.Due to having a small receptive field (extremely detailed information), they are used in areas like fingertips the most; they are not covered (shelled) and thus respond to pressures over long periods..Tactile corpuscles react to moderate vibration (10\u201350Hz) and light touch.They are located in the dermal papillae; due to their reactivity, they are primarily located in fingertips and lips.", "Magnolia": "Magnolia is a large genus of about 210 to 340[a] flowering plant species in the subfamily Magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae.The natural range of Magnolia species is disjunct, with a main center in east and southeast Asia and a secondary center in eastern North America, Central America, the West Indies, and some species in South America..Magnolia is an ancient genus that appeared before bees evolved,[when?] they are theorized to have evolved to encourage pollination by beetles instead.[2] Fossilized specimens of M.acuminata have been found dating to 20 million years ago, and fossils of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date to 95 million years ago.[3] Another aspect of Magnolia considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals.Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near the base of the flowering plant lineage, such as Amborella and Nymphaea (as well as with many more recently derived plants, such as Lilium)..Magnolias are spreading evergreen or deciduous trees or shrubs characterised by large fragrant flowers, which may be bowl-shaped or star-shaped, in shades of white, pink, purple, green, or yellow.In deciduous species, the blooms often appear before the leaves in spring.Cone-like fruits are often produced in the autumn.[4].As with all Magnoliaceae, the perianth is undifferentiated, with  9\u201315 tepals in three or more whorls.The flowers are hermaphroditic, with numerous adnate carpels and stamens arranged in a spiral fashion on the elongated receptacle.The flowers' carpels are extremely tough to avoid damage from pollinating beetles.[5].The fruit dehisces along the dorsal sutures of the carpels.", "White Christmas (song)": "\"White Christmas\" is an Irving Berlin song reminiscing about an old-fashioned Christmas setting.The song was written by Berlin for the 1942 musical film Holiday Inn.The composition won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 15th Academy Awards.Bing Crosby's record topped the Billboard chart for 11 weeks in 1942 and returned to the number one position again in December of 1943 and 1944.His version would return to the top 40  a dozen times in subsequent years..Since its release, \"White Christmas\" has been covered by many artists.The version sung by Bing Crosby is the world's best-selling single (in terms of sales of physical media), with estimated sales in excess of 50 million physical copies worldwide.[3] When the figures for other versions of the song are added to Crosby's, sales of the song exceed 100 million.[4][5][6].Accounts vary as to when and where Berlin wrote the song.[7] One story is that he wrote it in 1940, in warm La Quinta, California, while staying at the La Quinta Hotel, a frequent Hollywood retreat also favored by writer-director-producer Frank Capra, although the Arizona Biltmore also claims the song was written there.[8] He often stayed up all night writing.One day he told his secretary, \"I want you to take down a song I wrote over the weekend.Not only is it the best song I ever wrote, it's the best song anybody ever wrote.\"[9].The first public performance of the song was by Bing Crosby, on his NBC radio show The Kraft Music Hall on Christmas Day, 1941, a few weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor.[10] Crosby subsequently recorded the song with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra and the Ken Darby Singers at Radio Recorders for Decca Records in 18 minutes on May 29, 1942,[2] and it was released on July 30 as part of an album of six 78-rpm discs from the musical film Holiday Inn.[7][11] At first, Crosby did not see anything special about the song.He just said \"I don't think we have any problems with that one, Irving.\"[12].", "Cross-country skiing": "Cross-country skiing is a form of skiing whereby skiers traverse snow-covered terrain without use of ski lifts or other assistance.Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation.Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport..Modern cross-country skiing is similar to the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and Telemark skiing.Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow.It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including Europe, Canada, Russia, the United States, Australia[1] and New Zealand.[2].Competitive cross-country skiing is one of the Nordic skiing sports.Cross-country skiing and rifle marksmanship are the two components of biathlon.Ski orienteering is a form of cross-country skiing, which includes map navigation along snow trails and tracks.[3][4].The word ski comes from the Old Norse word sk\u00ed\u00f0 which means stick of wood.[5] Skiing started as a technique for traveling cross-country over snow on skis, starting almost five millennia ago with beginnings in Scandinavia.It may have been practised as early as 600 BCE in Daxing'anling, in what is now China.[6] Early historical evidence includes Procopius's (around CE 550) description of Sami people as skrithiphinoi translated as \"ski running samis\".[7] Birkely argues that the Sami people have practiced skiing for more than 6000 years, evidenced by the very old Sami word \u010duoigat for skiing.[8] Egil Skallagrimsson's 950 CE saga describes King Haakon the Good's practice of sending his tax collectors out on skis.[9] The Gulating law (1274) stated that \"No moose shall be disturbed by skiers on private land.\"[7] Cross-country skiing evolved from a utilitarian means of transportation to being a worldwide recreational activity and sport, which branched out into other forms of skiing starting in the mid-1800s.[10].Early skiers used one long pole or spear in addition to the skis.", "Use tax": "A use tax is a type of tax levied in the United States by numerous state governments.It is essentially the same as a sales tax but is applied not where a product or service was sold but where a merchant bought a product or service and then converted it for its own use, without having paid tax when it was initially purchased.Use taxes are functionally equivalent to sales taxes.They are typically levied upon the use, storage, enjoyment, or other consumption in the state of tangible personal property that has not been subjected to a sales tax.[1].Use tax is assessed upon tangible personal property and taxable services purchased by a resident or entity doing business in the taxing state upon the use, storage, enjoyment or consumption of the good or service, regardless of origin of the purchase.Use taxes are designed to discourage the purchase of products that are not subject to the sales tax within a taxing jurisdiction.[2] Use tax may be applied to purchases from out-of-state vendors that are not required to collect tax on their sales within the state.The use tax imposes a compensating tax equal in amount to the sales tax that would have been imposed on the sale of the property, if the sale had occurred within the state's taxing jurisdiction.[3]  The use tax is typically assessed at the same rate as the sales tax that would have been owed, and generally the taxability of the good or service does not vary.However, there are some instances where the sales tax rate and the use tax rate vary..For example, a resident of Massachusetts, with a 6.25% \"sales and use tax\" on certain goods and services, purchases non-exempt goods or services in New Hampshire for use, storage or other consumption in Massachusetts.Under New Hampshire law, the New Hampshire vendor collects no sales taxes on the goods, but the Massachusetts purchaser/user must still pay 6.25% of the sales price directly to the Department of Revenue in Massachusetts as a use tax.If the same goods are purchased in a US state that does collect sales tax for such goods at time of purchase, whatever taxes were paid by the purchaser to that state can be deducted (as a tax credit) from the 6.25% owed for subsequent use, storage or consumption in Massachusetts.With few exceptions, no state's vendors will charge the native state's sales tax on goods shipped out of state, meaning all goods ordered from out-of-state are essentially free of sales tax.", "Pulmonary hypertension": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH or PHTN) is a condition of increased blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.[7] Symptoms include shortness of breath, fainting, tiredness, chest pain, swelling of the legs, and a fast heartbeat.[7][2] The condition may make it difficult to exercise.[7] Onset is typically gradual.[8].According to the definition at the 6th World Symposium of Pulmonary Hypertension in 2018, a patient is deemed to have pulmonary hypertension if the pulmonary mean arterial pressure is greater than 20mmHg at rest, revised down from a purely arbitrary 25mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) greater than 3 Wood units..The cause is often unknown.[1] Risk factors include a family history, prior pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs), HIV/AIDS, sickle cell disease, cocaine use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea, living at high altitudes, and problems with the mitral valve.[5][4] The underlying mechanism typically involves inflammation and subsequent remodeling of the arteries in the lungs.[5] Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes.[1].As of 2022[update] there was no cure for pulmonary hypertension,[6] although research to find a cure is ongoing.Treatment depends on the type of disease.[6] A number of supportive measures such as oxygen therapy, diuretics, and medications to inhibit blood clotting may be used.[1] Medications specifically used to treat pulmonary hypertension include epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan, and sildenafil, tadalafil, selexipag, riociguat.[1] Lung transplantation may be an option in severe cases.[6].The frequency of occurrence is estimated at 1,000 new cases per year in the United States.[4][2] Females are more often affected than males.[2] Onset is typically between 20 and 60 years of age.[4] Pulmonary hypertension was identified by Ernst von Romberg in 1891.[9][1].According to WHO classification there are 5 groups of PH, where Group I (pulmonary arterial hypertension) is further subdivided into Group I' and Group I'' classes.[10][11] The WHO classification system in 2022 (with adaptations from the more recent ESC/ERS guidelines shown in italics) can be summarized as follows:[11][12].WHO Group I \u2013 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).WHO Group I' \u2013 Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH).WHO Group I\" \u2013 Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.WHO Group II \u2013 Pulmonary hypertension secondary to left heart disease.WHO Group III \u2013 Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease, chronic hypoxia.", "Sanuk": "", "Array programming": "In computer science, array programming refers to solutions that allow the application of operations to an entire set of values at once.Such solutions are commonly used in scientific and engineering settings..Modern programming languages that support array programming (also known as vector or multidimensional languages) have been engineered specifically to generalize operations on scalars to apply transparently to vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays.These include APL, J, Fortran, MATLAB, Analytica, Octave, R, Cilk Plus, Julia, Perl Data Language (PDL).In these languages, an operation that operates on entire arrays can be called a vectorized operation,[1] regardless of whether it is executed on a vector processor, which implements vector instructions.Array programming primitives concisely express broad ideas about data manipulation.The level of concision can be dramatic in certain cases: it is not uncommon[example  needed] to find array programming language one-liners that require several pages of object-oriented code..The fundamental idea behind array programming is that operations apply at once to an entire set of values.This makes it a high-level programming model as it allows the programmer to think and operate on whole aggregates of data, without having to resort to explicit loops of individual scalar operations..Kenneth E.Iverson described the rationale behind array programming (actually referring to APL) as follows:[2].most programming languages are decidedly inferior to mathematical notation and are little used as tools of thought in ways that would be considered significant by, say, an applied mathematician..", "Annuity (US financial products)": "In the United States, an annuity is a financial product which offers tax-deferred growth and which usually offers benefits such as an income for life.Typically these are offered as structured (insurance) products that each state approves and regulates in which case they are designed using a mortality table and mainly guaranteed by a life insurer.There are many different varieties of annuities sold by carriers.In a typical scenario, an investor (usually the annuitant) will make a single cash premium to own an annuity.After the policy is issued the owner may elect to annuitize the contract (start receiving payments) for a chosen period of time (e.g., 5, 10, 20 years, a lifetime).This process is called annuitization and can also provide a predictable, guaranteed stream of future income during retirement until the death of the annuitant (or joint annuitants).Alternatively, an investor can defer annuitizing their contract to get larger payments later, hedge long-term care cost increases, or maximize a lump sum death benefit for a named beneficiary.[1].Although annuities have existed in their present form only for a few decades, the idea of paying out a stream of income to an individual or family dates back to the Roman Empire.The Latin word annua meant annual stipends, and during the reign of the emperors, the word signified a contract that made annual payments.Individuals would make a single large payment into the annua and then receive an annual payment each year until death, or for a specified period of time.The Roman speculator and jurist Gnaeus Domitius Annius Ulpianus is cited as one of the earliest dealers of these annuities, and he is also credited with creating the first actuarial life table.Roman soldiers were paid annuities as a form of compensation for military service.", "List of federal judges appointed by Barack Obama": "Following is a comprehensive list of all Article III and Article IV United States federal judges appointed by President Barack Obama during his presidency, as well as a partial list of Article I federal judicial appointments, excluding appointments to the District of Columbia judiciary.[1].The total number of Obama Article III judgeship nominees to be confirmed by the United States Senate is 329, including two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States, 55 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, 268 judges to the United States district courts, and four judges to the United States Court of International Trade.Obama did not make any recess appointments to the federal courts..In terms of Article I courts, Obama made 8 appointments to the United States Tax Court, 3 appointments to the United States Court of Federal Claims, 3 appointments to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, 2 appointments to the United States Court of Military Commission Review, and 2 appointments to the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.He also elevated two chief judges of the Court of Federal Claims..On the Article IV territorial courts, President Obama made two appointments and elevated one judge to the

produce electricity.Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions.Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power plants.Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in some space probes such as Voyager 2.Generating electricity from fusion power remains the focus of international research..Most nuclear power plants use thermal reactors with enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle.Fuel is removed when the percentage of neutron absorbing atoms becomes so large that a chain reaction can no longer be sustained, typically three years.It is then cooled for several years in on-site spent fuel pools before being transferred to long term storage.The spent fuel, though low in volume, is high-level radioactive waste.While its radioactivity decreases exponentially it must be isolated from the biosphere for hundreds of thousands of years, though newer technologies (like fast reactors) have the potential to reduce this significantly.Because the spent fuel is still mostly fissionable material, some countries (e.g.France and Russia) reprocess their spent fuel by extracting fissile and fertile elements for fabrication in new fuel, although this process is more expensive than producing new fuel from mined uranium.", "Cold War": "The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc.The term cold war is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported opposing sides in major regional conflicts known as proxy wars.The conflict was based on the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their roles as the Allies of World War II that led to victory against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945.[2] Aside from the nuclear arms race and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means, such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, sports diplomacy, and technological competitions like the Space Race.The Cold War began shortly after the end of World War II, started a gradual winding down with the Sino-Soviet split between the Soviets and the People's Republic of China in 1961, and ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991..The Western Bloc was led by the United States, as well as a number of other First World nations that were generally liberal democratic but tied to a network of often authoritarian, Third World states, most of which were the European powers' former colonies.[3][B] The Eastern Bloc was led by the Soviet Union and its Communist Party, which had an influence across the Second World and was also tied to a network of authoritarian states.The Soviet Union had a command economy and installed similarly Communist regimes in its satellite states.United States involvement in regime change during the Cold War included support for anti-communist and right-wing dictatorships, governments, and uprisings across the world, while Soviet involvement in regime change included the funding left-wing parties, wars of national liberation and revolutions around the world.As nearly all the colonial states underwent decolonization and achieved independence in the period from 1945 to 1960, many became Third World battlefields in the Cold War..The first phase of the Cold War began shortly after the end of World War II in 1945.The United States and its Western European allies sought to strengthen their bonds and used the policy of containment against Soviet influence; they accomplished this most notably through the formation of NATO, which was essentially a defensive agreement in 1949.The Soviet Union countered with the Warsaw Pact in 1955, which had similar results with the Eastern Bloc.As by that time the Soviet Union already had an armed presence and political domination all over its eastern satellite states, the pact has been long considered superfluous.[4][5] Although nominally a defensive alliance, the Warsaw Pact's primary function was to safeguard Soviet hegemony over its Eastern European satellites, with the pact's only direct military actions having been the invasions of its own member states to keep them from breaking away;[6] in the 1960s, the pact evolved into a multilateral alliance, in which the non-Soviet Warsaw Pact members gained significant scope to pursue their own interests.", "Pikes Peak State Park": "Pikes Peak State Park is a state park in Clayton County, Iowa, United States, featuring a 500-foot (150m) bluff overlooking the Upper Mississippi River opposite the confluence of the Wisconsin River.The park is operated by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.It is nearly a thousand acres (4km\u00b2) in extent.The nearest city is McGregor, Iowa.Iowa Highway 76 approximately defines its northern boundary..It gets its name from the Iowa incarnation of Pikes Peak, a particularly high point overlooking the gorge of the Upper Mississippi, and like Pikes Peak in Colorado, is named for Zebulon Pike.Pike visited the area in 1805 during his first expedition, camping just downstream near Clayton on Sept.6 and across the river near Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin the next 3 nights.[3]  Pike climbed the bluff on Sept.5, looking for a suitable location for a fort and marked what would become known as Pike's Peak because it was \"level on the top, having a spring in the rear, and commanding a view of the country around.\"[4].There are hiking trails, campgrounds, and RV facilities.Mountain bikes are permitted in certain portions of the park.Aside from recreational development, the land in the park was never cleared and to a large extent remains as it was before the settlers..", "Zac Brown Band": "Zac Brown Band is an  American country music band based in Atlanta, Georgia.The lineup consists of Zac Brown (lead vocals, guitar), Jimmy De Martini (fiddle, vocals), John Driskell Hopkins (bass guitar, guitar, baritone guitar, banjo, ukulele, upright bass, vocals[7]), Coy Bowles (guitar, keyboards), Chris Fryar (drums), Clay Cook (guitar, keyboards, mandolin, steel guitar, vocals), Matt Mangano (bass guitar), Daniel de los Reyes (percussion), and Caroline Jones (guitar, keyboards, harmonica, vocals)..The band has released seven studio albums along with two live albums, one greatest-hits album, and two extended plays.They have also 16 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs or Country Airplay chart, of which 13 have reached number 1.Their first album, The Foundation, is certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, while its follow-ups, You Get What You Give and Uncaged, are certified platinum.Artists with whom they have collaborated include Alan Jackson, Angie Aparo, Jimmy Buffett, Kid Rock, Jason Mraz, Dave Grohl, Chris Cornell, Brandi Carlile, Avicii, Los Lonely Boys, and John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival..In 2002, Brown was traveling with a heavy tour schedule of approximately 200 dates a year.The initial Zac Brown Band lineup consisted of Brown, on acoustic guitar and lead vocals, backed by drummer Marcus Petruska and bass guitarist Jacob Lawson.In 2003, Brown started his own label, called Home Grown\u2014it was later renamed \"Southern Ground\"..In 2004, Brown opened a music club and restaurant with his father in the Lake Oconee area of Georgia, called \"Zac's Place\" where the fare was southern-style cooking.A developer bought the restaurant and, in turn, the Zac Brown Band bought a tour bus and began touring full-time, playing rock and country clubs, as well as folk and jam band festivals.The release of the Zac Brown Band's first independent album, Home Grown, occurred during the same year..", "Talk radio": "Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music.They may feature monologues, dialogues between the hosts, interviews with guests, and/or listener participation which may be live conversations between the host and listeners who \"call in\" (usually via telephone) or via voice mail.Listener contributions are usually screened by a show's producers to maximize audience interest and, in the case of commercial talk radio, to attract advertisers..Talks shows in commercial stations are organized into segments, each separated by a pause for advertisements; however, in public or non-commercial radio, music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments..Variations of talk radio include conservative talk, hot talk, liberal talk (increasingly known as progressive talk), and sports talk..While talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio, starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost-effective in the form of live internet website streaming and podcasts.Now, an individual can use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station.Also, TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC, CNN, Bloomberg, and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further.Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes, station directories such as TuneIn, show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher, and time-shifting services like DAR.fm.[1].SW Radio Africa was a pro-democracy station that broadcast out of London, England, from 2001 to 2014.[2].In Australia, talk radio is known as \"talkback radio\"..The most popular talkback radio station historically was Sydney's 2UE, whose populist programs like The John Laws Morning Show, were widely syndicated across the continent.", "HIPPA": "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA or the Kennedy\u2013Kassebaum Act[1][2]) is a United States Act of Congress enacted by the 104th United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on August 21, 1996.[3] It modernized the flow of healthcare information, stipulated how personally identifiable information maintained by the healthcare and healthcare insurance industries should be protected from fraud and theft,[4] and addressed some limitations on healthcare insurance coverage.It generally prohibits healthcare providers and healthcare businesses, called covered entities, from disclosing protected information to anyone other than a patient and the patient's authorized representatives without their consent.With limited exceptions, it does not restrict patients from receiving information about themselves.[5] It does not prohibit patients from voluntarily sharing their health information however they choose, nor does it require confidentiality where a patient discloses medical information to family members, friends, or other individuals not a part of a covered entity..The act consists of five titles.Title I of HIPAA protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs.[6] Title II of HIPAA, known as the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers.[7] Title III sets guidelines for pre-tax medical spending accounts, Title IV sets guidelines for group health plans, and Title V governs company-owned life insurance policies..There are five sections to the act, known as titles..Title I of HIPAA regulates the availability and breadth of group health plans and certain individual health insurance policies.It amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code.Furthermore, Title I addresses the issue of \"job lock\" which is the inability for an employee to leave their job because they would lose their health coverage.[8] To combat the job lock issue, the Title protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families if they lose or change their jobs.[9].Title I requires the coverage of and also limits restrictions that a group health plan can place on benefits for pre-existing conditions.Group health plans may refuse to provide benefits in relation to pre-existing conditions for either 12 months following enrolment in the plan or 18 months in the case of late enrolment.[10]  Title I allows individuals to reduce the exclusion period by the amount of time that they have had \"creditable coverage\" before enrolling in the plan and after any \"significant breaks\" in coverage.[11] \"Creditable coverage\" is defined quite broadly and includes nearly all group and individual health plans, Medicare, and Medicaid.[12] A \"significant break\" in coverage is defined as any 63-day period without any creditable coverage.[13] Along with an exception, it allows employers to tie premiums or co-payments to tobacco use, or body mass index..Title I[14] also requires insurers to issue policies without exclusion to those leaving group health plans with creditable coverage (see above) exceeding 18 months, and[15] renew individual policies for as long as they are offered or provide alternatives to discontinued plans for as long as the insurer stays in the market without exclusion regardless of health condition..", "Jakarta": "Jakarta (/d\u0292\u0259\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0rt\u0259/; Indonesian pronunciation: [d\u0292a\u02c8karta] \u24d8, Betawi: Jakart\u00e9), officially the Special Capital Region of Jakarta (Indonesian: Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta) and formerly Batavia, is the capital and largest metropolis of Indonesia.Lying on the northwest coast of Java, the world's most populous island, Jakarta is the largest metropole in Southeast Asia, and serves as the diplomatic capital of ASEAN.Jakarta is bordered by two Sundanese provinces: West Java to the south and east; and, since 2000, Banten to the west.Its coastline faces the Java Sea to the north, and it shares a maritime border with Lampung to the west..Jakarta is the economic, cultural, and political centre of Indonesia.It possesses a province-level status and has a population of 10,679,951 as of mid-2022.[11] Although Jakarta extends over only 661.23km2 (255.30sqmi) and thus has the smallest area of any Indonesian province, its metropolitan area covers 9,957.08km2 (3,844.45sqmi), which includes the satellite cities of Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Bekasi, and has an estimated population of 35million as of 2022[update], making it the largest urban area in Indonesia and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo).Jakarta ranks first among the Indonesian provinces in the human development index.Jakarta's business and employment opportunities, along with its ability to offer a potentially higher standard of living compared to other parts of the country, have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures..Jakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia.Established in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom.At one time, it was the de facto capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia.Jakarta was officially a city within West Java until 1960 when its official status was changed to a province with special capital region distinction.", "Air conditioning": "Air conditioning, often abbreviated as A/C (US) or air con (UK),[1] is the process of removing heat from an enclosed space to achieve a more comfortable interior environment (sometimes referred to as 'comfort cooling') and in some cases also strictly controlling the humidity of internal air.Air conditioning can be achieved using a mechanical 'air conditioner' or alternatively a variety of other methods, including passive cooling and ventilative cooling.Air conditioning is a member of a family of systems and techniques that provide heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC).Heat pumps are similar in many ways to air conditioners, but use a reversing valve to allow them both to heat and to cool an enclosed space..Air conditioners, which typically use vapor-compression refrigeration, range in size from small units used within vehicles or single rooms to massive units that can cool large buildings.[2] Air source heat pumps, which can be used for heating as well as cooling, are becoming increasingly common in cooler climates..According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), as of 2018, 1.6 billion air conditioning units were installed, which accounted for an estimated 20% of electricity usage in buildings globally with the number expected to grow to 5.6 billion by 2050.[3] The United Nations called for the technology to be made more sustainable to mitigate climate change and for the use of alternatives, like passive cooling, evaporative cooling, selective shading, windcatchers, and better thermal insulation.CFC and HCFC refrigerants such as R-12 and R-22, respectively, used within air conditioners have caused damage to the ozone layer,[4] and HFC refrigerants such as R-410a and R-404a, which were designed to replace CFCs and HCFCs, are instead exacerbating climate change.[5] Both issues happen due to the venting of refrigerant to the atmosphere, such as during repairs.HFO refrigerants, used in some if not most new equipment, solve both issues with an ozone damage potential (ODP) of zero and a much lower global warming potential (GWP) in the single or double digits vs.the three or four digits of HFCs.[6].Air conditioning dates back to prehistory.Ancient Egyptian buildings used a wide variety of passive air-conditioning techniques.[7] These became widespread from the Iberian Peninsula through North Africa, the Middle East, and Northern India.[8].Passive techniques remained widespread until the 20th century, when they fell out of fashion, replaced by powered air conditioning.", "6 Foot 7 Foot": "\"6 Foot 7 Foot\" (also styled as \"6'7\") is a song by rapper Lil Wayne featuring label mate Cory Gunz.It is taken from Wayne's ninth album, Tha Carter IV (2011).It was officially  released on iTunes on December 16, 2010.[2] It was produced by \"A Milli\" producer Bangladesh.The song samples \"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\" by Harry Belafonte (particularly, as the title implies, the lyric \"6 foot, 7 foot, 8 foot bunch\".).\"6 Foot 7 Foot\" is the first single off Tha Carter IV.The track is the first single Lil Wayne recorded following his release from prison on November 4, 2010, though it is the second song on which he has appeared since his prison release, after the final version of Birdman's single \"Fire Flame\", on which he had 2 verses.In the original version of the single, Lil Wayne is absent due to his prison sentence.[3] Before the song was officially released, Shade 45's DJ Drama interviewed Lil Wayne and he talked about the single.He said \"It's a monster,\" and \"Hopefully, it shows people where I'm at lyrically.\" Mack Maine, president of Young Money and fellow labelmate, called it \"A Milli on steroids.\" The track was originally intended for rapper T.I., but the Atlantic Records manager who also co-managed Lil Wayne decided Lil Wayne would be a better fit.Lil Wayne and producer Bangladesh reunited for the first time since \"A Milli\" after the royalty dispute between Bangladesh and Cash Money on that song.[4][5].It is the second time the trio (Lil Wayne, Cory Gunz, Bangladesh) have worked together, after 2008's \"A Milli\" (though Cory Gunz was not on the final version of that song).[citation needed] Lil Wayne performed the song on Saturday Night Live and New Year's Eve with Carson Daly.He also performed it on 106 & Party Cash Money Young Money New Years.[citation needed].On January 20, 2011, Lil Wayne announced that there would be a music video for the single in the upcoming spring.[6]  A picture was uploaded by Rap-Up of Lil Wayne portraying a boxer.", "DC Talk": "DC Talk (stylized as dc Talk) is a Christian rap and rock trio.The group was formed at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1987 by Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait, and Kevin Max Smith.They released five major studio albums together: DC Talk (1989), Nu Thang (1990), Free at Last (1992), Jesus Freak (1995), and Supernatural (1998).In 2002, the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music called DC Talk \"the most popular overtly Christian act of all time.\"[1].In 2001, the group released an EP, Solo, which contained two solo songs from each member.Since that time, DC Talk has been on an indefinite hiatus, and the three band members all have led solo careers and two have joined other groups.They performed and recorded individual songs together several times during the 2000s, although the group never officially reunited or disbanded..The group's musical style evolved significantly throughout its career.Its first two releases, DC Talk and Nu Thang, were predominantly hip hop.Their third album, Free at Last, also mainly took influence from hip hop while the group's music began to incorporate rock and other influences.The trio's last two albums, Jesus Freak and Supernatural, were predominantly pop rock.They are currently on hiatus and no announcements of new albums have been made.", "Chapters and verses of the Bible": "Chapter and verse divisions did not appear in the original texts of Judeo-Christian bibles; such divisions form part of the paratext of the Bible.Since the early 13th century, most copies and editions of the Bible have presented all but the shortest of the scriptural books with divisions into chapters, generally a page or so in length.Since the mid-16th century, editors have further subdivided each chapter into verses \u2013 each consisting of a few short lines or of one or more sentences.In the King James Version (KJV) Esther 8:9 is the longest verse[1] and John 11:35 is the shortest.[1] Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse, as in the case of Ephesians 2:8\u20139, and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse, as in the case of Genesis 1:2..The Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians.For instance, Jewish tradition regards the ascriptions to many Psalms as independent verses or as parts of the subsequent verses, whereas established Christian practice treats each Psalm ascription as independent and unnumbered, resulting in 116 more verses in Jewish versions than in the Christian texts.Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g.Hebrew Bibles have 1 Chronicles 5:27\u201341[2] where Christian translations have 1 Chronicles 6:1\u201315.[3][4].Early manuscripts of the biblical texts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers.In antiquity Hebrew texts were divided into paragraphs (parashot) that were identified by two letters of the Hebrew alphabet.Peh (\u05e4\u200e) indicated an \"open\" paragraph that began on a new line, while Samekh (\u05e1\u200e) indicated a \"closed\" paragraph that began on the same line after a small space.[5] These two letters begin the Hebrew words open (patuach) and closed (satum), and are, themselves, open in shape (\u05e4) and closed (\u05e1).The earliest known copies of the Book of Isaiah from the Dead Sea Scrolls used parashot divisions, although they differ slightly from the Masoretic divisions.[6].", "Index (publishing)": "An index (pl.: usually indexes, more rarely indices; see below) is a list of words or phrases ('headings') and associated pointers ('locators') to where useful material relating to that heading can be found in a document or collection of documents.Examples are an index in the back matter of a book and an index that serves as a library catalog.An index differs from a word index, or concordance, in focusing on the subject of the text rather than the exact words in a text, and it differs from a table of contents because the index is ordered by subject, regardless of whether it is early or late in the book, while the listed items in a table of contents is placed in the same order as the book.[1].In a traditional back-of-the-book index, the headings will include names of people, places, events, and concepts selected as being relevant and of interest to a possible reader of the book.The indexer performing the selection may be the author, the editor, or a professional indexer working as a third party.The pointers are typically page numbers, paragraph numbers or section numbers..In a library catalog the words are authors, titles, subject headings, etc., and the pointers are call numbers.Internet search engines (such as Google) and full-text searching help provide access to information but are not as selective as an index, as they provide non-relevant links, and may miss relevant information if it is not phrased in exactly the way they expect.[2].Perhaps the most advanced investigation of problems related to book indexes is made in the development of topic maps, which started as a way of representing the knowledge structures inherent in traditional back-of-the-book indexes.The concept embodied by book indexes lent its name to database indexes, which similarly provide an abridged way to look up information in a larger collection, albeit one for computer use rather than human use..In the English language, indexes have been referred to as early as 1593, as can be seen from lines in Christopher Marlowe's Hero and Leander of that year:.Therefore, even as an index to a book.", "Suspicious activity report": "In financial regulation, a Suspicious Activity Report  (SAR) or Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) is a report made by a financial institution about suspicious or potentially suspicious activity as required under laws designed to counter money laundering, financing of terrorism and other financial crimes.The criteria to decide when a report must be made varies from country to country, but generally is any financial transaction that either a) does not make sense to the financial institution; b) is unusual for that particular client; or c) appears to be done only for the purpose of hiding or obfuscating another, separate transaction.The report is filed with that country's financial crime enforcement agency, which is typically a specialist agency designed to collect and analyse transactions and then report these to relevant law enforcement teams..Front line staff in the financial institution have the responsibility to identify transactions that may be suspicious and these are reported to a designated person that is responsible for reporting the suspicious transaction.This means that the front line staff can ask questions and in some cases refuse the transaction.However the financial institution is not allowed to inform the client or parties involved in the transaction that a SAR has been lodged, otherwise known as tipping off under the Financial Action Task Force's Recommendations.[1].The Financial Action Task Force's Recommendations are widely recognized as the international standard in anti-money laundering and countering financing terrorism with endorsements from 180 nations.[2] FATF Recommendations set forth essential measures to combat money laundering and to protect domestic and international monetary systems including the application of preventive measures for the financial sector and other designated sectors; and establishment of powers and responsibilities for the relevant competent authorities (e.g., investigative, law enforcement and supervisory authorities), including guidelines regarding suspicious activity reports.[3].Most countries have laws that require financial institutions to report suspicious transactions and will have a designated agency to receive them.The agency to which a report is required to be filed for a given country is typically part of the law enforcement or financial regulatory department of that country.For example, in the United States, suspicious transaction reports[4] must be reported to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an agency of the United States Department of the Treasury.In Australia the Suspicious Matter Report must be reported to Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), an Australian government agency.A 2020 Bank Policy Institute study found that American SARs elicited a response from law enforcement in a median of 4% of reports, and that a tiny subset of those responses resulted in arrest and conviction, suggesting that 90% to 95% of SARs reports were false positives of unlawful activity.[5].", "Facebook": "Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by American technology giant Meta Platforms.Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students.Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities.Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old (or older), except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age limit is 14 years.[6] As of December2022[update], Facebook claimed 3billion monthly active users.[7] As of October 2023 Facebook ranked as the 3rd most visited website in the world with 22.56% of its traffic coming from the United States.[8][9] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[10].Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones.After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves.They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their \"friend\" or, with different privacy settings, publicly.Users can also communicate directly with each other with Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow..The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S.elections) and mass surveillance.[11] Facebook has also been subject to criticism over psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and various controversies over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech.[12] Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content, as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers.[13].Zuckerberg built a website called \"Facemash\" in 2003 while attending Harvard University.The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used \"photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the \"hotter\" person\".[15] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.[16] The site was sent to several campus group listservs, but was shut down a few days later by Harvard administration.", "Sulfonamide (medicine)": "Sulfonamide is a functional group (a part of a molecule) that is the basis of several groups of drugs, which are called sulphonamides, sulfa drugs or sulpha drugs.The original antibacterial sulfonamides  are synthetic (nonantibiotic) antimicrobial agents that contain the sulfonamide group.Some sulfonamides are also devoid of antibacterial activity, e.g., the anticonvulsant sultiame.The sulfonylureas and thiazide diuretics are newer drug groups based upon the antibacterial sulfonamides.[1][2].Allergies to sulfonamides are common.The overall incidence of adverse drug reactions to sulfa antibiotics is approximately 3%, close to penicillin;[3] hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully..Sulfonamide drugs were the first broadly effective antibacterials to be used systemically, and paved the way for the antibiotic revolution in medicine..In bacteria, antibacterial sulfonamides act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), an enzyme involved in folate synthesis.Sulfonamides are therefore bacteriostatic and inhibit growth and multiplication of bacteria, but do not kill them.Humans, in contrast to bacteria, acquire folate (vitamin B9) through the diet.[4].Sulfonamides are used to treat allergies and coughs, as well as having antifungal and antimalarial functions.The moiety is also present in other medications that are not antimicrobials, including thiazide diuretics (including hydrochlorothiazide, metolazone, and indapamide, among others), loop diuretics (including furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide), acetazolamide, sulfonylureas (including glipizide, glyburide, among others), and some COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib)..", "List of George Lopez characters": "This is a list of characters from George Lopez..George Edward Lopez (played by George Lopez) is the main protagonist of the series.He is the son of Manny and Benny Lopez.George married Angie Palmero right out of high school and had two children, Carmen and Max.George is of Mexican descent and proudly boasts about it several times throughout the series, though he occasionally makes jokes about it as well.In the pilot episode, \"Prototype,\" George gets promoted to manager of Powers & Sons Aviation (usually seen as Powers Bros.), an airplane parts factory.He is also dyslexic, which often comes into play on the show.His son, Max, also has dyslexia, but a more severe case than his father.George also loves to play golf and he usually does it whenever he gets out of situations and to outsmart his family, like listening to Carmen's poetry or talk about Max's dyslexic problems..George had a troubled childhood which is referenced throughout the series.His mother, Benny was neglectful and verbally abusive, which took a toll on George's childhood.George initially believed Manny, his father, was dead (which was what Benny told him so he would stop asking where his father was), but learned he was actually alive from Manny's sister and George's aunt, Cecelia.", "Domestic goose": "A domestic goose is a goose that humans have domesticated and kept for their meat, eggs, or down feathers.Domestic geese have been derived through selective breeding from the wild greylag goose (Anser anser domesticus) and swan goose (Anser cygnoides domesticus)..In Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia, the original domesticated geese are derived from the greylag goose (Anser anser).In eastern Asia, the original domesticated geese are derived from the swan goose (Anser cygnoides); these are commonly known as Chinese geese.Both have been widely introduced in more recent times, and modern flocks in both areas (and elsewhere, such as Australia and North America) may consist of either species or hybrids between them.Chinese geese may be readily distinguished from European geese by the large knob at the base of the bill, though hybrids may exhibit every degree of variation between the two species.[1].Charles Darwin remarked in The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication that the domestication of geese is of a very ancient date.[2] There is archaeological evidence for domesticated geese in Egypt more than 4,000 years ago.[3] It has been proposed that geese were domesticated around 3000 BCE in southeastern Europe, possibly in Greece, but reliable evidence of domestic geese comes from a much later period (8th century BCE) in The Odyssey.Another potential domestication site is in Egypt during the Old Kingdom (2686\u20131991 BCE) due to iconographic evidence of goose exploitation, but this scenario for the original domestication event has been considered less likely.Geese were also herded by ancient Mesopotamians for food and sacrifices and depicted in Mesopotamian art from the early Dynastic Period (2900\u20132350 BCE) onwards.Certainly, fully domesticated geese were present during the New Kingdom times in Egypt (1552\u20131151 BCE) and contemporaneously in Europe, and goose husbandry involving several varieties was well established by the Romans by the 1st century BCE.In the Medieval Period, goose husbandry was at its peak with large flocks kept by peasants.Archaeological evidence of the domestic goose in northern Europe indicates that it was probably introduced into Scandinavia during the Early Iron Age (400 BCE\u2013550 CE).[4].", "30 Seconds to Mars": "Thirty Seconds to Mars (commonly stylized as 30 Seconds to Mars) is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1998.The band consists of brothers Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) and Shannon Leto (drums, percussion).During the course of its existence, it has undergone various line-up changes with the Leto brothers being the only consistent members..The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was produced by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success.The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of its second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world.Its next release, This Is War (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as it incorporated experimental music as well as eclectic influences.The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012).Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success.It was followed by America (2018), which polarized critics upon release..As of September 2014, the band had sold over 15 million albums worldwide.[1] Thirty Seconds to Mars has consistently enjoyed sold out tours and numerous headlining festival slots.The band is noted for its energetic live performances and for fusing elements from a wide variety of genres, through its use of philosophical and spiritual lyrics, concept albums, and experimental music.[2] Thirty Seconds to Mars has received several awards and accolades throughout its career, including a Guinness World Record, and has been included in the Kerrang! list of best artists of the 2000s.[3].Thirty Seconds to Mars started in 1998 in Los Angeles, California, as a collaboration between brothers Jared Leto and Shannon Leto, who had been playing music together since their childhood.[4] The duo later expanded to a four-piece when they added guitarist Solon Bixler and bassist Matt Wachter to the line-up.", "A Christmas Story": "A Christmas Story is a 1983 American Christmas comedy film directed by Bob Clark and based on Jean Shepherd's semi-fictional anecdotes in his 1966 book In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, with some elements from his 1971 book Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and Other Disasters.It stars Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin, and Peter Billingsley.Widely considered a holiday classic in the United States and Canada, it has been shown in a marathon annually on TNT since 1997 and on TBS since 2004 titled \"24 Hours of A Christmas Story\", consisting of 12 consecutive airings of the film from the evening of Christmas Eve to the evening of Christmas Day annually.[3] It is the third installment in the Parker Family Saga..The film was released on November 18, 1983, and received positive reviews from critics.Filmed partly in Canada, it earned two Canadian Genie Awards in 1984.In 2012, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[4][5][6].The film spawned three sequels.The first, entitled It Runs in the Family, also directed by Clark, was released in 1994.The second, entitled A Christmas Story 2, was released straight to DVD in 2012.A third sequel, entitled A Christmas Story Christmas, was released on HBO Max in 2022 and features most of the original cast returning..The film

across the United States..Joe's Crab Shack opened its first location in Houston, Texas in 1991.Landry's Restaurants, Inc.purchased the original Joe's in Houston in early 1994 to convert it into a Landry's Restaurant.By 1995 the chain had grown to three locations in Houston and one in Dallas.[1].On November 17, 2006, Joe's was sold to J.H.Whitney & Company, a privately held company, operating as JCS Holdings, LLC.The sales price was $192 million including the assumption of liabilities of $225 million.[2].JCS Holdings changed their name to Ignite Restaurant Group in April 2009 and operated the 130 existing Joe's and 26 Brickhouse Tavern and Tap restaurants.Ignite Restaurant Group went public in 2012..[3] The company was headquartered on Westpark Drive near the Westchase District of Houston.[citation needed].", "New York Passenger Ship Terminal": "The Manhattan Cruise Terminal, formerly known as the New York Passenger Ship Terminal or Port Authority Passenger Ship Terminal is a ship terminal for ocean-going passenger ships in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, New York City.[3] It was constructed and expanded in the 1920s and 1930s as a replacement for the Chelsea Piers..The New York Passenger Ship Terminal originally consisted of Piers 84, 86, 88, 90, 92 and 94, located on the Hudson River between West 44th and West 54th Street.[4] They were first designed to replace the Chelsea Piers as the city's luxury liner terminal and accommodate bigger ships that had outgrown the Chelsea Piers..The two southernmost piers, each 1,000 feet long, were initially constructed in the 1920s to keep up with the growth in maritime traffic.[5] By the 1930s, however, even larger facilities were needed, leading to the construction between 1935 and 1937 of Piers 88\u201392, each 1,100 feet (340 m) long and 400 feet (120 m) apart..The plan was to lengthen a number of existing 800-foot piers, but the US Army Corps of Engineers, who controlled the waterfront dimension, would not allow the extension of the pierhead line farther into the river, so the city was forced to extend the pier by cutting away at the land.The city had previously done this for the Chelsea Piers, however in Chelsea only landfill was removed.At the Passenger Terminal, actual Manhattan schist was taken away.[6] The results of this can also be seen in the West Side Highway's diversion eastward from West 57th to 42nd Street..By the 1960s, the old facilities had deteriorated and lacked the amenities of modern cruise terminals.[7] After years of planning, a new terminal was designed around Piers 88-92, to be operated by the Port Authority.Construction began in 1971 and was completed in 1974.[8].In 2004, the NYPST piers began another $200 million renovation to accommodate newer and larger cruise ships.The renovation plans included the decommissioning of Pier 92 and for the remaining piers to handle three large ships at a time.[9].Norwegian Cruise Line's ship the Norwegian Breakaway sails year-round out of the New York Passenger Ship Terminal.In 2011 the city committed $4 million to renovate and upgrade the cruise terminal to accommodate the ship.[10].", "List of NCIS characters": "NCIS is an American police procedural television series, revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which investigates crimes involving the

"The Christian right, or the religious right, are Christian political factions which are characterized by their strong support of socially conservative and traditionalist policies.[1] Christian conservatives seek to influence politics and public policy with their interpretation of the teachings of Christianity.[2][3][4].In the United States, the Christian right is an informal coalition which was formed around a core of predominantly White conservative Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics.[2][5][6][7] The Christian right draws additional support from politically conservative mainline Protestants and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[5][8] The movement has its roots in American politics going back as far as the 1940s; it has been especially influential since the 1970s.[1][9][10][11][12] Its influence draws from grassroots activism as well as from focus on social issues and the ability to motivate the electorate around those issues.[13].The Christian right is notable because it has advanced socially conservative positions on issues such as creationism in public education,[14] school prayer,[15] temperance,[16] Christian nationalism,[17] and Sunday Sabbatarianism,[18] as well as opposition to biological evolution,[14] embryonic stem cell research,[19] LGBT rights,[3][9][15][20] comprehensive sex education,[21][22] abortion,[15][23] and pornography.[24] Although the term Christian right is most commonly associated with politics in the United States, similar Christian conservative groups can be found in the political cultures of other Christian-majority countries..The Christian right is \"also known as the New Christian Right (NCR) or the Religious Right\", although some consider the religious right to be \"a slightly broader category than Christian Right\".[10][25].John C.Green of the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life states that Jerry Falwell used the label religious right to describe himself.Gary Schneeberger, vice president of media and public relations for Focus on the Family, states that \"[t]erms like 'religious right' have been traditionally used in a pejorative way to suggest extremism.The phrase 'socially conservative evangelicals' is not very exciting, but that's certainly the way to do it.\"[26].Evangelical leaders like Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council have called attention to the problem of equating the term Christian right with evangelicals.Although evangelicals constitute the core constituency of the Christian right, not all evangelicals fit the description, and a number of Roman Catholics are also members of the Christian right's core base.[5] The problem of description is further complicated by the fact that the label religious conservative or conservative Christian may apply to other religious groups as well.For instance, Anabaptist Christians (most notably Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, the Bruderhof Communities, Schwarzenau Brethren, River Brethren and Apostolic Christians) are theologically, socially, and culturally conservative; however, there are no overtly political organizations associated with these Christian denominations, which are usually uninvolved, uninterested, apathetic, or indifferent towards politics.[27] Tim Keller, an Evangelical theologian and Presbyterian Church in America pastor, shows that Conservative Christianity (theology) predates the Christian right (politics), and that being a theological conservative didn't necessitate being a political conservative, that some political progressive views around economics, helping the poor, the redistribution of wealth, and racial diversity are compatible with theologically conservative Christianity.[28] Rod Dreher, a senior editor for The American Conservative, a secular conservative magazine, also argues the same differences, even claiming that a \"traditional Christian\" a theological conservative, can simultaneously be left on economics (economic progressive) and even a socialist at that while maintaining traditional Christian beliefs.[29].In 1863, representatives from eleven Christian denominations in the United States organized the National Reform Association with the goal of adding a Christian amendment to the U.S.", "Far east movement": "Far East Movement (abbreviated FM) is an American hip hop and electronic music group based in Los Angeles.The group formed in 2003 and as of August 2018 consists of Kev Nish (Kevin Nishimura), Prohgress (James Roh), DJ Virman (Virman Coquia), JT Rollerson (James

cell size or battery size may have widely different characteristics; physical interchangeability is not the sole factor in substituting a battery.[1].The full battery designation identifies not only the size, shape and terminal layout of the battery but also the chemistry (and therefore the voltage per cell) and the number of cells in the battery.For example, a CR123 battery is always LiMnO2 ('Lithium') chemistry, in addition to its unique size..The following tables give the common battery chemistry types for the current common sizes of batteries.See Battery chemistry for a list of other electrochemical systems..1.2 (NiMH, NiCd).Used in many household electronic devices..1.2 (NiMH, NiCd).Used in many household electronic devices..Various fractional sizes are available; e.g.:.", "Hurricane Katrina": "Hurricane Katrina was a devastating Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that caused 1,836 fatalities and damage estimated between $97.4 billion to $145.5 billion in late August 2005, particularly in the city of New Orleans and its surrounding area.[1] At the time, it was the costliest tropical cyclone on record, later tied by Hurricane Harvey of 2017.Katrina was the twelfth tropical cyclone, the fifth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.It was also the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States, gauged by barometric pressure..Katrina began on August 23, 2005, with the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten.Early the following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and headed generally westward toward Florida.On August 25, two hours before making landfall at Hallandale Beach, it strengthened into a hurricane.After briefly weakening to tropical storm strength over southern Florida, Katrina entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and rapidly intensified.The storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico[2] before weakening to a high-end Category 3 hurricane at its second landfall on August 29 over southeast Louisiana and Mississippi..The largest loss of life in Hurricane Katrina was due to flooding caused by engineering flaws in the flood protection system, particularly the levee[3]  around the city of New Orleans.[4] Eventually, 80% of the city, as well as large areas in neighboring parishes, were flooded for weeks.[5] The flooding destroyed most of New Orleans's transportation and communication facilities, leaving tens of thousands of people who did not evacuate the city prior to landfall with little access to food, shelter, and other basic necessities.The disaster in New Orleans prompted a massive national and international response effort, including federal, local, and private rescue operations to evacuate those displaced from the city in the following weeks.After the storm, multiple investigations concluded that the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers, which had designed and built the region's levees decades earlier, was responsible for the failure of the flood-control systems.[6] However, federal courts later ruled that the Corps could not be held financially liable due to sovereign immunity in the Flood Control Act of 1928.[7].", "National debt of the United States": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis.2013 budget sequestration.The national debt of the United States is the total national debt owed by the federal government of the United States to Treasury security holders.The national debt at any point in time is the face value of the then-outstanding Treasury securities that have been issued by the Treasury and other federal agencies.The terms \"national deficit\" and \"national surplus\" usually refer to the federal government budget balance from year to year, not the cumulative amount of debt.In a deficit year the national debt increases as the government needs to borrow funds to finance the deficit, while in a surplus year the debt decreases as more money is received than spent, enabling the government to reduce the debt by buying back some Treasury securities.In general, government debt increases as a result of government spending and decreases from tax or other receipts, both of which fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year.[1] There are two components of gross national debt:[2].Historically, the U.S.public debt as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) increases during wars and recessions and then subsequently declines.The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease as a result of a government surplus or via growth of GDP and inflation.For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP had peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but has since reached new highs of up to 134.84% of GDP during the second quarter of 2020.[3] In recent decades, aging demographics and rising healthcare costs have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.[4] The aggregate, gross amount that Treasury can borrow is limited by the United States debt ceiling.[5].Total US federal government debt breached $30 trillion mark for the first time in history in February 2022.[6] As of August 2023, total federal debt was $32.6 trillion; $25.8 trillion held by the public and $6.8 trillion in intragovernmental debt.[7] The annualized cost of servicing this debt was $726 billion in July 2023, which accounted for 14% of the total federal spending.[8] In December 2021, debt held by the public was estimated at 96.19% of GDP, and approximately 33% of this public debt was owned by foreigners (government and private).[9] The United States has the largest external debt in the world.", "Assist (basketball)": "In basketball, an assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads directly to a score by field goal, meaning that they were \"assisting\" in the basket.An assist is also credited when a basket is awarded due to defensive goaltending..There is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assist.An assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ball for a short distance.However, the original definition of an assist did not include such situations,[1] so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matter..Only the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist, so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal (unlike in other sports, such as ice hockey).A pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the NBA, but does in FIBA play (only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is made)..Point guards tend to get the most assists per game (apg), as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler..Centers tend to get fewer assists, but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assisting.Being inside the key, the center often has the best angles and the best position for \"dishes\" and other short passes in the scoring area.Current NBA Center Nikola Joki\u0107 is among the league leaders in assists and play-making.Center Wilt Chamberlain led the NBA in total assists in 1968.", "Mill (currency)": "The mill (American English) or mil (Commonwealth English, except Canada) is a unit of currency (sometimes symbolized as \u20a5), used in several countries as one-thousandth of the base unit.In the United States, it is a notional unit equivalent to a thousandth of a United States dollar (a hundredth of a dime or a tenth of a cent).In the United Kingdom, it was proposed during the decades of discussion on decimalisation as a 1\u20441000 division of sterling's pound.While this system was never adopted in the United Kingdom, the currencies of some British or formerly British territories did adopt it, such as the Palestine pound and the Maltese lira..The term comes from the Latin \"millesimum\", meaning \"thousandth part\".[1].In the United States, the term was first used by the Continental Congress in 1786, being described as the \"lowest money of account, of which 1000 shall be equal to the federal dollar\".[2].The Coinage Act of 1792 describes milles and other subdivisions of the dollar:.That the money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars or units, dismes or tenths, cents or hundredths, and milles or thousandths, a disme being the tenth part of a dollar, a cent the hundredth part of a dollar, a mille the thousandth part of a dollar, and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation.[3].The mint of Philadelphia made half cents worth 5 mills each from 1793 to 1857..Tokens in this denomination were issued by some states and local governments (and by some private interests) for such uses as payment of sales tax.[4] These were of inexpensive material such as tin, aluminium, plastic or paper.Rising inflation depreciated the value of these tokens in relation to the value of their constituent materials; this depreciation led to their eventual abandonment.Virtually none were made after the 1960s..", "Greco-Persian Wars": "The Greco-Persian Wars (also often called the Persian Wars) were a series of conflicts between the Achaemenid Empire and Greek city-states that started in 499 BC[i] and lasted until 449 BC.The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered the Greek-inhabited region of Ionia in 547 BC.Struggling to control the independent-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them.This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike..In 499 BC, the tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, embarked on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos, with Persian support;[2] however, the expedition was a debacle and, preempting his dismissal, Aristagoras incited all of Hellenic Asia Minor into rebellion against the Persians.This was the beginning of the Ionian Revolt, which would last until 493 BC, progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflict.Aristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria, and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis.The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this act.The revolt continued, with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497\u2013495 BC.In 494 BC, the Persians regrouped and attacked the epicenter of the revolt in Miletus.At the Battle of Lade, the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat, and the rebellion collapsed, with the final embers being stamped out the following year..Seeking to secure his empire from further revolts and from the interference of the mainland Greeks, Darius embarked on a scheme to conquer Greece and to punish Athens and Eretria for the burning of Sardis.", "Hooverville": "A Hooverville was a shanty town built during the Great Depression by the homeless in the United States.They were named after Herbert Hoover, who was President of the United States during the onset of the Depression and was widely blamed for it.The term was coined by Charles Michelson.[1] There were hundreds of Hoovervilles across the country during the 1930s.[2].Homelessness was present before the Great Depression, and was a common sight before 1929.Most large cities built municipal lodging houses for the homeless, but the Depression exponentially[3] increased demand.The homeless clustered in shanty towns close to free soup kitchens.These settlements were often trespassing on private lands, but they were frequently tolerated or ignored out of necessity.The New Deal enacted special relief programs aimed at the homeless under the Federal Transient Service (FTS), which operated from 1933 to 1939.This happened during the great depression..Some of the men who were forced to live in these conditions possessed construction skills, and were able to build their houses out of stone.Most people, however, resorted to building their residences out of wood from crates, cardboard, scraps of metal, or whatever materials were available to them.They usually had a small stove, bedding and a couple of simple cooking implements.[4] Men, women and children alike lived in Hoovervilles.[5] Most of these unemployed residents of the Hoovervilles relied on public charities or begged for food from those who had housing during this era..Democrats coined other similar terms that were jabs at Herbert Hoover:[6] \"Hoover blankets\" were old newspapers used as blanketing, a \"Hoover flag\" was an empty pocket turned inside out, \"Hoover leather\" was cardboard used to line a shoe when the sole wore through, and a \"Hoover wagon\" was an automobile with horses hitched to it (often with the engine removed).[7].", "Matt Hasselbeck": "Matthew Michael Hasselbeck (born September 25, 1975)[1] is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL).He played college football at Boston College and was drafted in the sixth round of the 1998 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers.After a season on the practice squad and two seasons backing up Brett Favre, he was traded to the Seattle Seahawks in 2001, where he spent the majority of his career.Hasselbeck led Seattle to six playoff appearances, including the franchise\u2019s first Super Bowl appearance during the 2005 season.He was selected to three Pro Bowls in his career.Hasselbeck also played for the Tennessee Titans and Indianapolis Colts.He is a former analyst for ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown and Monday Night Countdown..Hasselbeck is the son of Mary Beth \"Betsy\" (Rueve) and Don Hasselbeck, a former New England Patriots tight end.[2] Matt and his younger brothers Tim and Nathanael grew up in Norfolk, Massachusetts, and attended Xaverian Brothers High School in Westwood.He was selected as an honorable mention All-American by USA Today as a high school senior..Hasselbeck attended Boston College near his family's hometown.He played for the Boston College Eagles football team from 1994 through 1997, including two years with his younger brother Tim.[3] Hasselbeck finished his college career as the starting quarterback (a position his brother Tim would later hold with the Eagles).He graduated with a degree in marketing.[4].", "Information and communications technology": "Information and communications technology (ICT) is an extensional term for information technology (IT) that stresses the role of unified communications[1] and the integration of telecommunications (telephone lines and wireless signals) and computers, as well as necessary enterprise software, middleware, storage and audiovisual, that enable users to access, store, transmit, understand and manipulate information..ICT is also used to refer to the convergence of audiovisuals and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or link system.There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone networks with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling, signal distribution, and management.ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing radio, television, cell phones, computer and network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and appliances with them such as video conferencing and distance learning.ICT also includes analog technology, such as paper communication, and any mode that transmits communication.[2].ICT is a broad subject and the concepts are evolving.[3] It covers any product that will store, retrieve, manipulate, transmit, or receive information electronically in a digital form (e.g., personal computers including smartphones, digital television, email, or robots).Skills Framework for the Information Age is one of many models for describing and managing competencies for ICT professionals in the 21st century.[4].The phrase \"information and communication technologies\" has been used by academic researchers since the 1980s.[5] The abbreviation \"ICT\" became popular after it was used in a report to the UK government by Dennis Stevenson in 1997,[6] and then in the revised National Curriculum for England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2000.However, in 2012, the Royal Society recommended that the use of the term \"ICT\" should be discontinued in British schools \"as it has attracted too many negative connotations\".[7] From 2014, the National Curriculum has used the word computing, which reflects the addition of computer programming into the curriculum.[8].Variations of the phrase have spread worldwide.The United Nations has created a \"United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force\" and an internal \"Office of Information and Communications Technology\".[9].The money spent on IT worldwide has been estimated as US$3.8 trillion [10] in 2017 and has been growing at less than 5% per year since 2009.", "Plum pudding model": "The plum pudding model is one of several historical scientific models of the atom.First proposed by J.J.Thomson in 1904[1] soon after the discovery of the electron, but before the discovery of the atomic nucleus, the model tried to account for two properties of atoms then known: that electrons are negatively charged subatomic particles and that atoms have no net electric charge.The plum pudding model has electrons surrounded by a volume of positive charge, like negatively charged \"plums\" embedded in a positively charged \"pudding\"..It had been known for many years that atoms contain negatively charged subatomic particles.Thomson called them \"corpuscles\" (particles), but they were more commonly called \"electrons\", the name G.J.Stoney had coined for the \"fundamental unit quantity of electricity\" in 1891.[2] It had also been known for many years that atoms have no net electric charge.Thomson held that atoms must also contain some positive charge that cancels out the negative charge of their electrons.[3][4] Thomson published his proposed model in the March 1904 edition of the Philosophical Magazine, the leading British science journal of the day.In Thomson's view:....", "Bacon": "Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork[1] made from various cuts, typically the belly or less fatty parts of the back.It is eaten as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts), used as a central ingredient (e.g., the bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich (BLT)), or as a flavouring or accent (as in bacon bits in a salad)..Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant, and may also be used to insulate or flavour roast joints by being layered onto the meat.The word is derived from the Proto-Germanic *bakkon, meaning \"back meat\".[2].Meat from other animals, such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or turkey, may also be cut, cured, or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon, and may even be referred to as, for example, \"turkey bacon\".[3] Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations as both religions prohibit the consumption of pork.[4] Vegetarian bacons such as \"soy bacon\" also exist..Before the advent of cheap and widespread artificial refrigeration in the modern era, the curing of meat was necessary for its safe long-term preservation.However, both the flavour imparted to the meat in doing so and the extended shelf life it offered had become much prized, and although curing is in general no longer necessary in the developed world, it continues in wide use..Bacon is cured through either a process of injecting it with or soaking it in brine, known as wet curing, or rubbed with salt, known as dry curing.[1][5] Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably nitrites or nitrates, which speed the curing and stabilize colour.Cured bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, or it may be smoked or boiled.[1] Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying.Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating.Differing flavours can be achieved by using various types of wood, or less common fuels such as corn cobs or peat.This process can take up to eighteen hours, depending on the intensity of the flavour desired.", "Employee Retirement Income Security Act": "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (Pub.L.Tooltip Public Law (United States)93\u2013406, 88Stat.829, enacted September 2, 1974, codified in part at 29 U.S.C.ch.18) is a U.S.federal tax and labor law that establishes minimum standards for pension plans in private industry.It contains rules on the federal income tax effects of transactions associated with employee benefit plans.ERISA was enacted to protect the interests of employee benefit plan participants and their beneficiaries by:.ERISA is sometimes used to refer to the full body of laws that regulate employee benefit plans, which are mainly in the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA itself..Responsibility for interpretation and enforcement of ERISA is divided among the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury (particularly the Internal Revenue Service), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation..In 1961, U.S.President John F.Kennedy created the President's Committee on Corporate Pension Plans.", "Illegal immigration to the United States": "Foreign nationals (aliens) can violate US immigration laws by entering the United States unlawfully[2][3] or lawfully entering but then remaining after the expiration of their visas, parole, TPS, etc.Illegal immigration has been a matter of intense debate in the United States since the 1980s.[citation needed].The illegal immigrant population of the United States peaked by 2007, when it was at 12.2 million and 4% of the total U.S.population.[4][5] Estimates in 2016 put the number of unauthorized immigrants at 10.7 million, representing 3.3% of the total U.S.population.[4] Since the Great Recession, more illegal immigrants have left the United States than entered it, and illegal border crossings were at the lowest in decades until 2021, when a record of 1.7 million people were caught trying to cross the southern border illegally.[6][7][8][9][10] Since 2007, visa overstays have accounted for a larger share of the growth in the illegal immigrant population than illegal border crossings,[11] which have declined considerably from 2000 to 2018.[12] In 2012, 52% of unauthorized immigrants were from Mexico, 15% from Central America, 12% from Asia, 6% from South America, 5% from the Caribbean, and another 5% from Europe and Canada.[13] As of 2016, approximately two-thirds of unauthorized adult immigrants had lived in the U.S.for at least a decade.[4].Opponents of illegal immigration argue that people who enter the United States illegally are criminals, as well as social and economic burdens on law-abiding natives.Opponents also argue that illegal immigrants who enter the United States illegally should be deported instead of being awarded with U.S.citizenship and social services.[14] Some argue that illegal immigrants should instead enter the United States lawfully through legal immigration.[15][16].Research shows that illegal immigrants increase the size of the U.S.economy, contribute to economic growth, enhance the welfare of natives, contribute more in tax revenue than they collect, reduce American firms' incentives to offshore jobs and import foreign-produced goods, and benefit consumers by reducing the prices of goods and services.[17][18][19][20] Economists estimate that legalization of the illegal immigrant population would increase the immigrants' earnings and consumption considerably, and increase U.S.gross domestic product.[21][22][23][24] There is scholarly consensus that illegal immigrants commit less crime than natives.[25][26] Sanctuary cities\u2014which adopt policies designed to avoid prosecuting people solely for being in the country illegally\u2014have no statistically meaningful impact on crime.[27][28] Research suggests that immigration enforcement has no impact on crime rates.[27][29][30].", "Alvin Independent School District": "Alvin Independent School District is a school district based in Alvin, Texas, U.S..Alvin ISD is a large suburban school district south of Houston in Alvin, Manvel, Hillcrest, Iowa Colony, Liverpool, and portions of Pearland.[4] It also serves Amsterdam and some areas with Rosharon postal addresses.AISD serves Pearland city's rapidly growing western portion of the city including the new large master-planned communities of Shadow Creek Ranch, South Fork, and Southern Trails.Alvin ISD covers 252 square miles (650km2) of land..As of the 2020/21 school year, the appraised valuation of property in the district was $10,805,729,375.[citation needed] The Maintenance tax rate was $1.0052.The I&S Rate is .3925.The tax rate was $1.3977 per $100 of appraised valuation.[citation needed].In 2011, the school district was rated \"Recognized\" by the Texas Education Agency.[5]  Forty-nine percent of districts in Texas in 2011 received the same rating.[6] No state accountability ratings will be given to districts in 2012.[7] A school district in Texas can receive one of four possible rankings from the Texas Education Agency: Exemplary (the highest possible ranking), Recognized, Academically Acceptable, and Academically Unacceptable (the lowest possible ranking)..Historical district TEA accountability ratings[5].Beginning with the 2008\u20132009 school year, Alvin Independent School District was realigned the following way: Sister schools (Alvin Primary School/Alvin Elementary School; Stevenson Primary School/Walt Disney Elementary School; and Mark Twain Primary School/Longfellow Elementary School) became grades PK-2 and 3\u20135.All other elementary schools were changed to grades PK-5 with 6th grade being transitioned to the Junior High level across the district.The two alternative schools were not affected by this realignment..", "Ulnar nerve": "In human anatomy, the ulnar nerve is a nerve that runs near the ulna bone.The ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint is in relation with the ulnar nerve.The nerve is the largest in the human body unprotected by muscle or bone, so injury is common.[1] This nerve is directly connected to the little finger, and the adjacent half of the ring finger, innervating the palmar aspect of these fingers, including both front and back of the tips, perhaps as far back as the fingernail beds..This nerve can cause an electric shock-like sensation by striking the medial epicondyle of the humerus posteriorly, or inferiorly with the elbow flexed.The ulnar nerve is trapped between the bone and the overlying skin at this point.This is commonly referred to as bumping one's \"funny bone\".This name is thought to be a pun, based on the sound resemblance between the name of the bone of the upper arm, the humerus, and the word \"humorous\".[2] Alternatively, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, it may refer to \"the peculiar sensation experienced when it is struck\".[3].The ulnar nerve originates from the C8-T1 nerve roots (and occasionally carries C7 fibers which arise from the lateral cord),[4][5] which then form part of the medial cord of the brachial plexus, and descends medial to the brachial artery, up until the insertion point of coracobrachialis muscle (middle 5cm over the medial border of the humerus).Then, it pierces the medial intermuscular septum and enters the posterior compartment of the arm, accompanied by superior ulnar collateral vessels.It runs at the posteromedial aspects of the humerus, passing behind the medial epicondyle (in the cubital tunnel) at the elbow, where it can be palpated by hand.[6].The ulnar nerve is not a content of the cubital fossa.It enters the anterior (flexor) compartment of the forearm between the two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris,[5] and lies along the lateral border of the flexor carpi ulnaris.[5] The ulnar nerve runs between the flexor digitorum superficialis (laterally) and flexor digitorum profundus medially.", "Hogwarts": "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (/\u02c8h\u0252\u0261w\u0254\u02d0rts/) is a fictional boarding school of magic for students aged eleven to eighteen, and is the primary setting for the first six books in J.K.Rowling's Harry Potter series and serves as a major setting in the Wizarding World universe.[3].Founded around the 9th century and 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin, Hogwarts was established in the Highlands of Scotland to educate young wizards and witches as well as to keep students safe from Muggle persecution.Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake.[4] Since then, Hogwarts educated most wizarding children with residence in Great Britain and Ireland, keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and Muggles..About 300 years after the school was founded, the Triwizard Tournament was established as an interscholastic competition among the three most prestigious magical schools in Europe: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang.The tournament continued for six centuries before being discontinued.An attempt was made in the 1994\u20131995 school year to revive the tournament, but the consequential death of Cedric Diggory resulted in its permanent discontinuation.[5].Hogwarts is a coeducational, secondary boarding school, taking children from ages eleven to eighteen,[6] in line with real-world combined secondary and sixth form institutions in Britain.Education at Hogwarts is not compulsory, with some students being home schooled as stated in the seventh book.Rowling initially said there are about one thousand students at Hogwarts.[7] She later suggested around six hundred, while acknowledging that this number was still inconsistent with the small number of people in Harry's year.She further explained that this had resulted from her creating only forty characters for Harry's year.[8].", "Subprime mortgage crisis": "The American subprime mortgage crisis was a multinational financial crisis that occurred between 2007 and 2010 that contributed to the 2007\u20132008 global financial crisis.[1][2] The crisis led to a severe economic recession, with millions of people losing their jobs and many businesses going bankrupt.The U.S.government intervened with a series of measures to stabilize the financial system, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)..It was triggered by a large decline in US home prices after the collapse of a housing bubble, leading to mortgage delinquencies, foreclosures, and the devaluation of housing-related securities.Declines in residential investment preceded the Great Recession and were followed by reductions in household spending and then business investment.Spending reductions were more significant in areas with a combination of high household debt and larger housing price declines.[3].The housing bubble preceding the crisis was financed with mortgage-backed securities (MBSes) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which initially offered higher interest rates (i.e.better returns) than government securities, along with attractive risk ratings from rating agencies.While elements of the crisis first became more visible during 2007, several major financial institutions collapsed in September 2008, with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession.[4].There were many causes of the crisis, with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions, regulators, credit agencies, government housing policies, and consumers, among others.[5] Two proximate causes were the rise in subprime lending and the increase in housing speculation.The percentage of lower-quality subprime mortgages originated during a given year rose from the historical 8% or lower range to approximately 20% from 2004 to 2006, with much higher ratios in some parts of the U.S.[6][7] A high percentage of these subprime mortgages, over 90% in 2006 for example, had an interest rate that increased over time.[4] Housing speculation also increased, with the share of mortgage originations to investors (i.e.those owning homes other than primary residences) rising significantly from around 20% in 2000 to around 35% in 2006\u20132007.", "Myers-Briggs Type Indicator": "In personality typology, the Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.It enjoys popularity despite being widely regarded as pseudoscience by the scientific community.[1][2][3][4] The test attempts to assign a binary value to each of four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, and judging or perceiving.One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result representing one of sixteen possible personalities, such as \"ISTJ\" or \"ENFP\".[5][6][7].The MBTI was constructed by two Americans: Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, who were inspired by the book Psychological Types by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung.[8] Isabel Myers was particularly fascinated by the concept of introversion and she typed herself as an \"INFP\".However, she felt the book was too complex for the general public, and therefore she tried to organize the Jungian cognitive functions to make it more accessible.[9].Most of the research supporting the MBTI's validity has been produced by the Center for Applications of Psychological Type, an organization run by the Myers\u2013Briggs Foundation, and published in the center's own journal, the Journal of Psychological Type (JPT), raising questions of independence, bias, and conflict of interest.[10] Though the MBTI resembles some psychological theories, it has been criticized as pseudoscience[11] and is not widely endorsed by academic researchers in the psychology field.[12] The indicator exhibits significant scientific (psychometric) deficiencies, including poor validity, poor reliability, measuring categories that are not independent, and not being comprehensive.[13][14][15][16].Briggs began her research into personality in 1917.Upon meeting her future son-in-law, she observed marked differences between his personality and that of other family members.Briggs embarked on a project of reading biographies, and subsequently developed a typology wherein she proposed four temperaments: meditative (or thoughtful), spontaneous, executive, and social.[17][18].After the publication in 1923 of an English translation of Carl Jung's book Psychological Types (first published in German as Psychologische Typen in 1921), Briggs recognized that Jung's theory resembled, but went far beyond, her own.[19] Briggs's four types were later identified as corresponding to the IXXXs (Introverts: \"meditative\"), EXXPs (Extraverts & Prospectors: \"spontaneous\"), EXTJs (Extraverts, Thinkers & Judgers: \"executive\") and EXFJs (Extraverts, Feelers & Judgers: \"social\").[i][17][18] Her first publications were two articles describing Jung's theory, in The New Republic, \"Meet Yourself Using the Personality Paint Box\" (1926)[20] and \"Up From Barbarism\" (1928).[21] After extensively studying the work of Jung, Briggs and her daughter extended their interest in human behavior into efforts to turn the theory of psychological types to practical use.[6][17].Although Myers graduated from Swarthmore College in political science in 1919,[22] neither Myers nor Briggs were formally educated in the discipline of psychology, and both were self-taught in the field of psychometric testing.[23] Myers therefore apprenticed herself to Edward N.Hay (1891\u20131958), the head personnel officer for a large Philadelphia  bank.", "Judas (song)": "\"Judas\" is a song by American singer Lady Gaga, recorded for her second studio album, Born This Way (2011).It was released by Interscope Records on April 15, 2011, as the second single from the album.Written and produced by Lady Gaga and Nadir \"RedOne\" Khayat, it is an electro house song about a woman in love with a man who betrayed her.It embodies the incidents that have haunted Gaga in the past, and its core meaning refers to the negative parts of her life that she cannot escape.Gaga has further explained that the song was also about honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring oneself into the light.[2] The artwork for the single was designed by Gaga in Microsoft Word.In spite of a polarizing impact on several religious groups, the song was generally well received by critics, who linked the song to \"Bad Romance\" with some noting it should have been the album's lead single..The song has a similar sound to Gaga's previous RedOne-produced tracks, including \"Poker Face\", \"LoveGame\", \"Bad Romance\", and \"Alejandro\".It contains three distinct hooks and a house-influenced break down.Gaga explained that the lines spoken during the breakdown talk about her as beyond redemption, regarding the traditional views of what a woman should be.\"Judas\" initially had a strong sales opening, but was less successful commercially in comparison to Gaga's previous singles.The song reached the top ten of the charts in twenty-one countries.It is certified Diamond in France..", "Marvin Gaye": "Marvin Pentz Gay Jr.(April 2, 1939 \u2013 April 1, 1984),[2] who also spelled his surname as Gaye, was an American singer and songwriter.He helped to shape the sound of Motown in the 1960s, first as an in-house session player (Drums) and later as a solo artist with a string of successes, earning him the nicknames \"Prince of Motown\" and \"Prince of Soul\"..Gaye's Motown songs include \"Ain't That Peculiar\", \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\", and \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\".Gaye also recorded duets with Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Tammi Terrell, and Diana Ross.During the 1970s, Gaye recorded the albums What's Going On (1971) and Let's Get It On (1973) and became one of the first artists in Motown to break away from the reins of a production company..His later recordings influenced several contemporary R&B subgenres, such as quiet storm and neo soul.[3] \"Sexual Healing\", released in 1982 on the album Midnight Love, won him his first two Grammy Awards.[4] Gaye's last televised appearances were at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, where he sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"; and on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever; and Soul Train.[5].On April 1, 1984, on the day before his 45th birthday, Gaye was shot and killed by his father, Marvin Gay Sr., at their house in Western Heights, Los Angeles,[6][7] after an argument.Gay Sr.later pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter, and received a six-year suspended sentence and five years of probation.Many institutions have posthumously bestowed Gaye with awards and other honors including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and inductions into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[8].Marvin Pentz Gay Jr.", "Academy Award for Best Picture": "The Academy Award for Best Picture is one of the Academy Awards (also known as Oscars) presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) since the awards debuted in 1929.This award goes to the producers of the film and is the only category in which every member of the Academy is eligible to submit a nomination and vote on the final ballot.[1] The Best Picture category is traditionally the final award of the night and is widely considered as the most prestigious honor of the ceremony.[2][3][4].The Grand Staircase columns at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the Academy Awards ceremonies have been held since 2002, showcase every film that has won the Best Picture title since the award's inception.[5] There have been 591 films nominated for Best Picture and 95 winners.[6].At the 1st Academy Awards ceremony held in 1929 (for films made in 1927 and 1928), there were two categories of awards that were each considered the top award of the night: \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Unique and Artistic Picture,\" the former being won by the war epic Wings, and the latter by the art film Sunrise.Each award was intended to honor different and equally important aspects of superior filmmaking.In particular, The Jazz Singer was disqualified from both awards, since its use of synchronized sound made the film a sui generis item that would have unfairly competed against either category, and the Academy granted the film an honorary award instead.[7].The following year, the Academy dropped the Unique and Artistic Picture award, deciding retroactively that the award won by Wings was the highest honor that could be awarded, and allowed synchronized sound films to compete for the award.[8] Although the award kept the title Outstanding Picture for the next ceremony, the name underwent several changes over the years as seen below.Since 1962, the award has been simply called Best Picture.[6].Until 1950, this award was presented to a representative of the production company.That year the protocol was changed so that the award was presented to all credited producers.This rule was modified in 1999 to apply a maximum limit of three producers receiving the award, after the five producers of Shakespeare in Love had received the award.[9][10][11].As of 2020[update], the \"Special Rules for the Best Picture of the Year Award\" limit recipients to those who meet two main requirements:[12].", "Heavy Rain": "Heavy Rain is a 2010 action-adventure video game developed by Quantic Dream and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.The game features four protagonists involved with the mystery of the Origami Killer, a serial killer who uses extended periods of rainfall to drown his victims.The player interacts with the game by performing actions highlighted on screen related to motions on the controller, and in some cases, performing a series of quick time events.The player's decisions and actions during the game affect the narrative..Game developer David Cage wrote the 2,000-page script, acted as director for the four years of development, travelled to Philadelphia to research the setting, and intended to improve upon what was flawed in his 2005 game Fahrenheit.Composer Normand Corbeil wrote the score, which was recorded at Abbey Road Studios.The game was released for PlayStation 3 in February 2010, PlayStation 4 in 2016, and Windows in 2019.A critical and commercial success, Heavy Rain is considered one of the best video games ever made, receiving praise for its emotional impact, visuals, writing, controls, and music, though some critics faulted the controls, voice acting, and plot inconsistencies.It sold 5.3 million units by January 2018..Heavy Rain is an interactive drama and action-adventure game[1][2] in which the player controls four different characters from a third-person perspective.[3][4][5] Each playable character may die depending on the player's actions, which create a branching storyline;[6] in these cases, the player is faced with quick time events.[7] The game is divided into multiple scenes, each centering on one of the characters.[8].Holding down R2 moves the character forward and the left analogue stick controls the direction.Interaction with the environment is done by pressing on-screen, context-sensitive prompts, using the right analogue stick, and performing Sixaxis control movements with the DualShock 3 or 4.[9] Also featured are difficulty levels that the player can change at any point during the game.[8] A chapter-select screen offers the function of playing scenes over again.[10] With PlayStation Move, the player wields either the motion and navigation controllers, or the DualShock and motion controllers.[11].", "Superannuation in Australia": "In Australia, superannuation or \"super\" is a retirement savings system.It involves money earned by an employee being placed into an investment fund to be made legally available to fund members upon retirement..Under the Australian superannuation system, employers make compulsory payments to these funds at a proportion of their employee's wages.As of July 2023[update], the mandatory minimum contribution is 11%.[1] This percentage figure is referred to as the \"superannuation guarantee\"..The superannuation guarantee was introduced by the Hawke government to promote self-funded retirement savings, reducing reliance on a publicly funded pension system.[2] Legislation to support the introduction of the superannuation guarantee was passed by the Keating Government in 1992.[2].Contributions to superannuation accounts are subject to a concessional income tax rate of 15%.This means that for most Australians, the tax on their money sent to a superannuation account is less than the tax on money sent to their bank account..Australians can contribute additional superannuation beyond the 11% minimum, subject to limits.The maximum amount that may be contributed per year is $27,500.[3] Contributions higher than this are taxed at the person's ordinary marginal tax rate, meaning there is no tax benefit for contributing beyond that amount.[4] Ultimately, superannuation is a system of mandatory saving coupled with tax concessions..As of 30March2022[update], Australians have AU$3.5 trillion invested as superannuation assets, making Australia as a nation the 4th largest holder of pension fund assets in the world.[5] The vast majority of this money is in defined contribution funds..For many years until 1976, what superannuation arrangements were in place were set up under industrial awards negotiated by the union movement or individual unions..A change to superannuation arrangements came about in 1983 through an agreement between the government and the trade unions.", "List of The Game characters": "This is a list of the characters and plot points from the American comedy-drama television series The Game..Legacy Characters of the series appeared throughout the various seasons through its different iterations.Though seen as an ensemble cast of leads, the original characters of Melanie and Derwin was most known as the leads of the CW series.Organically the show centered and surrounded the life of Melanie Barnett, a pre-med student who struggled to keep a relationship with a pro-football player while the rest of the cast storylines were supported dealing with the life and experiences dating football players as well as the athletes highs and lows of their careers and also raising one while representing athletes.During the changes of the BET revival and re-casting of season 6, new characters were brought in to fill the main cast, hoping that Keira and Bryce/'Blue' would make up for the main characters but ultimately resulting in the ensemble becoming collectively as leads as their storylines were equally displayed.Subsequently with the Paramount+ revival series, Tasha Mack and Malik Wright became the longest running characters of the series with Tasha Mack becoming lead character as the storyline centers more about her struggles to run her sports agency..(seasons 1 - 3).(seasons 4 - 9).(seasons 1 - present).also known as season 10 - present.\"Med School\" by Tasha Mack,.\"Girl Melanie\" by Malik Wright,.", "Electoral College (United States)": "In the United States, the Electoral College is the group of presidential electors required by the Constitution to form every 4 years for the sole purpose of appointing the president and vice president.Each state appoints electors under the methods described by its legislature, equal in number to its congressional delegation (representatives and senators).The federal District of Columbia also has 3 electors under an amendment adopted in 1961.Federal office holders, including senators and representatives, cannot be electors.Of the current 538 electors, a simple majority of 270 or more electoral votes is required to elect the president and vice president.If no candidate achieves a majority there, a contingent election is held by the House of Representatives to elect the president and by the Senate to elect the vice president..The states and the District of Columbia hold a statewide or districtwide popular vote on Election Day in November to choose electors based upon how they have pledged to vote for president and vice president, with some state laws prohibiting faithless electors.All states except Maine and Nebraska use a party block voting, or general ticket method, to choose their electors, meaning all their electors go to one winning ticket.Maine and Nebraska choose one elector per congressional district and 2 electors for the ticket with the highest statewide vote.The electors meet and vote in December, and the inauguration of the president and vice president take place in January..The merits of the electoral college system is a matter of ongoing debate in the United States, which came closest to switching to direct voting for president in 1969\u201370 (a transition all other democratic countries with electoral colleges for the executive head of state have made).[1] Supporters argue that it requires presidential candidates to have broad appeal across the country to win, while critics argue that it is not representative of the popular will of the nation.[a] Winner-take-all systems, especially with representation not proportional to population, does not align with the principle of \"one person, one vote\".[b][5] Critics object to the inequity that due to the distribution of electors, individual citizens in states with smaller populations have more voting power than those in larger states.[6] This is because the number of electors each state appoints is equal to the size of its congressional delegation, each state is entitled to at least 3 regardless of its population, and the apportionment of the statutorily fixed number of the rest is only roughly proportional.This allocation has contributed to runners-up of the nationwide popular vote being elected president in 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016.[7][8] In addition, faithless electors may not vote in accord with their pledge.[9][c] Further objection is that candidates focus their campaigns on swing states.[11].", "Barack Obama": "Barack Hussein Obama II (/b\u0259\u02c8r\u0251\u02d0k hu\u02d0\u02c8se\u026an

2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S.Senate.", "Honda CBR1100XX": "The Honda CBR1100XX Super Blackbird is a Honda motorcycle, part of the CBR series made from 1996 to 2007.The bike was developed to challenge the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-11 as the world's fastest production motorcycle,[9] and Honda succeeded with a top speed of 177mph (285km/h).[2][10] Two years later the title passed to the Suzuki Hayabusa, which reached 193mph (311km/h).[9][11][12] The Blackbird is named after the Lockheed SR-71, also a speed record holder.[9][13].It has the largest-displacement engine in Honda's CBR range of motorcycles..In the mid-1990s, Honda was determined to produce the world's fastest production motorcycle and to take over the associated bragging rights and marketing impact, at the time held by Kawasaki's Ninja ZX11.[9] This led to the creation of the CBR1100XX Super Blackbird.The Blackbird name is a nod to the Lockheed SR-71 aircraft, the world's fastest production aircraft.[13].In the February 1997 issue of Sport Rider magazine, the CBR1100XX was tested at a top speed of 178.5mph (287.3km/h),[2] compared with 175mph (281.6km/h) for the ZX-11.[14].Its supremacy over the ZX-11 was confirmed in April 2007 by Motorcycle Consumer News, although the speeds achieved were slightly lower and the margin was narrower.[5].In 1999, the Suzuki Hayabusa overtook the CBR1100XX.It was listed in the 2000 Millennium Edition of Guinness World Records as the world's fastest production bike with a top speed of 194mph (312km/h) Hayabusa is the Japanese term for the Peregrine Falcon, a species of raptor which preys on blackbirds.[11].Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate.HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload file.Create accountLog in.", "Electronic health record": "An  electronic health record (EHR) is the systematized collection of patient and population electronically stored health information in a digital format.[1] These records can be shared across different health care settings.Records are shared through network-connected, enterprise-wide information systems or other information networks and exchanges.EHRs may include a range of data, including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics like age and weight, and billing information.[2].For several decades, electronic health records (EHRs) have been touted as key to increasing of quality care.[3] Electronic health records are used for other reasons than charting for patients;[4] today, providers are using data from patient records to improve quality outcomes through their care management programs.EHR combines all patients demographics into a large pool, and uses this information to assist with the creation of \"new treatments or innovation in healthcare delivery\" which overall improves the goals in healthcare.[4] Combining multiple types of clinical data from the system's health records has helped clinicians identify and stratify chronically ill patients.EHR can improve quality care by using the data and analytics to prevent hospitalizations among high-risk patients..EHR systems are designed to store data accurately and to capture the state of a patient across time.It eliminates the need to track down a patient's previous paper medical records and assists in ensuring data is up-to-date,[5] accurate and legible.It also allows open communication between the patient and the provider, while providing \"privacy and security.\"[5] It can reduce risk of data replication as there is only one modifiable file, which means the file is more likely up to date and decreases risk of lost paperwork and is cost efficient.[5] Due to the digital information being searchable and in a single file, EMRs (electronic medical records) are more effective when extracting medical data for the examination of possible trends and long term changes in a patient.Population-based studies of medical records may also be facilitated by the widespread adoption of EHRs and EMRs..The terms EHR, electronic patient record (EPR) and EMR have often been used interchangeably, but differences between the models are now being defined.The electronic health record (EHR) is a more longitudinal collection of the electronic health information of individual patients or populations.", "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner": "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (originally The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere) is the longest major poem by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, written in 1797\u20131798 and published in 1798 in the first edition of Lyrical Ballads.Some modern editions use a revised version printed in 1817 that featured a gloss.[1] Along with other poems in Lyrical Ballads, it is often considered a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature.[2].The Rime of the Ancient Mariner recounts the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage.The mariner stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story.The Wedding-Guest's reaction turns from bemusement to impatience to fear to fascination as the mariner's story progresses, as can be seen in the language style: Coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood in different parts of the poem..The poem begins with an old grey-bearded sailor, the Mariner, stopping a guest at a wedding ceremony to tell him a story of a sailing voyage he took long ago.The Wedding-Guest is at first reluctant to listen, as the ceremony is about to begin, but the mariner's glittering eye captivates him..The mariner's tale begins with his ship departing on its journey.Despite initial good fortune, the ship is driven south by a storm and eventually reaches the icy waters of the Antarctic.An albatross appears and leads the ship out of the ice jam where it is stuck, but even as the albatross is fed and praised by the ship's crew, the mariner shoots the bird:.[...] With

the operating system that powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone; the term also includes the system software for iPads (predating iPadOS, which was introduced in 2019) as well as on the iPod Touch devices (which were discontinued in mid-2022).[6] It is the world's second-most widely installed mobile operating system, after Android.It is the basis for three other operating systems made by Apple: iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS.[7] It is proprietary software, although some parts of it are open source under the Apple Public Source License and other licenses.[8].Unveiled in 2007 for the first-generation iPhone, iOS has since been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch (September 2007) and the iPad (introduced: January 2010; availability: April 2010).As of March2018[update], Apple's App Store contains more than 2.1million iOS applications, 1million of which are native for iPads.[9] These mobile apps have

(automotive)": "A spoiler is an automotive aerodynamic device whose intended design function is to 'spoil' unfavorable air movement across a body of a vehicle in motion, usually described as turbulence or drag.Spoilers on the front of a vehicle are often called air dams.Spoilers are often fitted to race and high-performance sports cars, although they have become common on passenger vehicles as well.Some spoilers are added to cars primarily for styling purposes and have either little aerodynamic benefit or even make the aerodynamics worse..The term \"spoiler\" is often mistakenly used interchangeably with \"wing\".An automotive wing is a device whose intended design is to generate downforce as air passes around it, not simply disrupt existing airflow patterns.[1][2] As such, rather than decreasing drag, automotive wings actually increase drag..Since spoiler is a term describing an application, the operation of a spoiler varies depending on the particular effect it is trying to spoil.Most common spoiler functions include disrupting some type of airflow passing over and around a moving vehicle.A common spoiler diffuses air by increasing amounts of turbulence flowing over the shape, \"spoiling\" the laminar flow and providing a cushion for the laminar boundary layer.[citation needed] However, other types of airflow may require the spoiler to operate differently and take on vastly different physical characteristics..While a mass is traveling at increasing speeds, the air of the environment affects its movement.Spoilers in racing are used in combination with other features on the body or chassis of race cars to change the handling characteristics that are affected by the air of the environment..Often, these devices are designed to be highly adjustable to suit the needs of racing on a given track or to suit the talents of a particular driver, with the overall goal of reaching faster times..", "List of video games featuring Mario": "Mario, who serves as

of Constant Sorrow\" (also known as \"I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow\") is a traditional American folk song first published by Dick Burnett, a partially blind fiddler from Kentucky.The song was originally titled \"Farewell Song\" in a songbook by Burnett dated to around 1913.A version recorded by Emry Arthur in 1928 gave the song its current titles..Several versions of the song exist that differ in their lyrics and melodies.The song was popularized by the Stanley Brothers, who recorded the song in the 1950s; many other singers recorded versions in the 1960s, most notably by Bob Dylan.Variations of the song have also been recorded under the titles of \"Girl of Constant Sorrow\" by Joan Baez and by Barbara Dane, \"Maid of Constant Sorrow\" by Judy Collins, and \"Sorrow\" by Peter, Paul and Mary.It was released as a single by Ginger Baker's Air Force with vocals by Denny Laine..Public interest in the song was renewed after the release of the 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou?, where it plays a central role in the plot, earning the three runaway protagonists public recognition as the Soggy Bottom Boys.The song, with lead vocal by Dan Tyminski, was featured on the film's highly successful, multiple platinum-selling soundtrack.That recording won a Grammy for Best Country Collaboration at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards in 2002.[1].The song was first published in 1913 with the title \"Farewell Song\" in a six-song songbook by Dick Burnett, titled Songs Sung by R.D.", "Volt": "The volt (symbol: V) is the unit of electric potential, electric potential difference (voltage), and electromotive force in the International System of Units (SI).[1] It is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745\u20131827)..One volt is defined as the electric potential between two points of a conducting wire when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points.[2] Equivalently, it is the potential difference between two points that will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge that passes through it.It can be expressed in terms of SI base units (m, kg, s, and A) as.It can also be expressed as amperes times ohms (current times resistance, Ohm's law), webers per second (magnetic flux per time), watts per ampere (power per current), or joules per coulomb (energy per charge), which is also equivalent to electronvolts per elementary charge:.The volt is named after Alessandro Volta.As with every SI unit named for a person, its symbol starts with an upper case letter (V), but when written in full, it follows the rules for capitalisation of a common noun; i.e., \"volt\" becomes capitalised at the beginning of a sentence and in titles but is otherwise in lower case..Historically, the \"conventional\" volt, V90, defined in 1987 by the 18th General Conference on Weights and Measures[3] and in use from 1990 to 2019, was implemented using the Josephson effect for exact frequency-to-voltage conversion, combined with the caesium frequency standard.Though the Josephson effect is still used to realize a volt, the constant used has changed slightly..For the Josephson constant, KJ = 2e/h (where e is the elementary charge and h is the Planck constant), a \"conventional\" value KJ-90 = 0.4835979GHz/\u03bcV was used for the purpose of defining the volt.As a consequence of the 2019 redefinition of SI base units, as of 2019 the Josephson constant has an exact value of KJ = 483597.84841698...GHz/V, which replaced the conventional value KJ-90..This standard is typically realized using a series-connected array of several thousand or tens of thousands of junctions, excited by microwave signals between 10 and 80GHz (depending on the array design).[4] Empirically, several experiments have shown that the method is independent of device design, material, measurement setup, etc., and no correction terms are required in a practical implementation.[5].In the water-flow analogy, sometimes used to explain electric circuits by comparing them with water-filled pipes, voltage (difference in electric potential) is likened to difference in water pressure, while current is proportional to  the amount of water flowing.", "Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria": "The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand[a] was one of the key events that led to World War I.Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were assassinated on 28 June 1914 by Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip.They were shot at close range while being driven through Sarajevo, the provincial capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, formally annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908..Princip was part of a group of six Bosnian assassins together with Muhamed Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107, Vaso \u010cubrilovi\u0107, Nedeljko \u010cabrinovi\u0107, Cvjetko Popovi\u0107 and Trifko Grabe\u017e coordinated by Danilo Ili\u0107; all but one were Bosnian Serbs and members of a student revolutionary group that later became known as Young Bosnia.The political objective of the assassination was to free Bosnia and Herzegovina of Austria-Hungarian rule and establish a common South Slav (\"Yugoslav\") state.The assassination precipitated the July Crisis which led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia and the start of World War I..The assassination team was helped by the Black Hand, a Serbian secret nationalist group; support came from Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107, chief of the military intelligence section of the Serbian general staff, as well as from Major Vojislav Tankosi\u0107 and Rade Malobabi\u0107, a Serbian intelligence agent.Tankosi\u0107 provided bombs and pistols to the assassins and trained them in their use.The assassins were given access to the same clandestine network of safe-houses and agents that Malobabi\u0107 used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary..The assassins and key members of the clandestine network were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914.In total twenty-five people were indicted.All six assassins, except Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107, were under twenty at the time of the assassination; while the group was dominated by Bosnian Serbs, four of the indictees were Bosnian Croats, and all of them were Austro-Hungarian citizens, none from Serbia.", "Mission San Juan Capistrano": "Mission San Juan Capistrano (Spanish: Misi\u00f3n San Juan Capistrano) is a Spanish mission in San Juan Capistrano, Orange County, California.Founded November 1, 1776 in colonial Las Californias by Spanish Catholic missionaries of the Franciscan Order, it was named for Saint John of Capistrano.The Spanish Colonial Baroque style church was located in the Alta California province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.The Mission was founded less than 60 yards from the village of Acjacheme.[14][15] The Mission was secularized by the Mexican government in 1833, and returned to the Roman Catholic Church by the United States government in 1865.The Mission was damaged over the years by a number of natural disasters, but restoration and renovation efforts date from around 1910.It functions today as a museum..The mission was founded in 1776, by the Spanish Catholics of the Franciscan Order.Named for Saint John of Capistrano, a 14th-century theologian and \"warrior priest\" who resided in the Abruzzo region of Italy, San Juan Capistrano has the distinction of being home to the oldest building in California still in use, a chapel built in 1782.\"Father Serra's Church\", also known as \"Serra's Chapel\", is the only extant structure where it has been documented that Junipero Serra celebrated  Mass.The mission is one of the best known in Alta California, and one of the few to have actually been founded twice \u2013 the others being Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel and Mission La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n.The site was originally consecrated on October 30, 1775, by Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n, but was quickly abandoned due to unrest among the indigenous population in San Diego..The success of the settlement's population is evident in its historical records.", "Better Off Dead (film)": "Better Off Dead is a 1985 American black comedy film written and directed by Savage Steve Holland.It stars John Cusack as high school student Lane Myer, who becomes suicidal after his girlfriend breaks up with him shortly before Christmas..Initially met with mixed to negative reviews on release, it has since gone on to have a cult following for its unconventionally surreal and absurdist humor..In the town of Greendale[a] in Northern California, high school student Lane Myer's two main interests are skiing and his girlfriend of six months, Beth.Shortly before Christmas, Beth dumps Lane for the handsome and popular captain of the ski team, Roy Stalin.Roy is an arrogant bully who unfairly rejects Lane at ski team tryouts.Beth also criticizes Lane's car, an old station wagon.Although Lane also owns a 1967 Camaro, he has not been able to get it running and it sits in the driveway in a dilapidated state..Lane lives in a suburban development with his mother, Jenny, a ditzy housewife who routinely concocts creepy (and creeping) family meals; his genius little brother, Badger, who never speaks but at the age of \"almost 8\" can build powerful lasers and attract trashy women from \"How-to\" books; and his lawyer father, Al, who daily tries to stop the menacing paperboy, Johnny, from breaking his garage door windows with thrown newspapers.Furthermore, Johnny claims that the Myers owe him two dollars for newspapers, and persistently hounds Lane, yelling \"I want my two dollars!\" Lane also regularly encounters two Korean drag racers, who speak in Japanese, one of whom learned to speak English by listening to Howard Cosell..Lane cannot get past Beth's rejection and decides that death is the only way out of his misery.He makes several half-hearted attempts at suicide, which all comically fail.", "Mercedes-Benz Superdome": "The Caesars Superdome (originally Louisiana Superdome and formerly Mercedes-Benz Superdome), commonly known as the Superdome, is a domed multi-purpose stadium located in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana.It is the home stadium of the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL)..Plans were drawn up in 1967 by the New Orleans modernist architectural firm of Curtis and Davis and the building opened as the Louisiana Superdome in 1975.Its steel frame covers a 13-acre (5.3ha) expanse and the 273-foot (83m) dome is made of a lamellar multi-ringed frame and has a diameter of 680 feet (207m), making it the largest fixed domed structure in the world.[6].The Superdome has routinely hosted major sporting events; it has hosted seven Super Bowl games (and will host its eighth, Super Bowl LIX, in 2025), and five NCAA championships in men's college basketball.In college football, the Sugar Bowl has been played at the Superdome since 1975, which is one of the \"New Year's Six\" bowl games of the College Football Playoff (CFP).It also traditionally hosts the Bayou Classic, a rivalry game played between the HBCUs Southern University and Grambling State University.The Superdome was also the long-time home of the Tulane Green Wave football team of Tulane University until 2014 (when they returned on-campus at Yulman Stadium), and was the home venue of the New Orleans Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1975 until 1979..In 2005, the Superdome housed thousands of people seeking shelter from Hurricane Katrina.The building suffered extensive damage as a result of the storm, and was closed for many months afterward.The building was fully refurbished and reopened in time for the Saints' 2006 home opener on September 25..Local businessman David Dixon (who later founded the United States Football League in the 1980s) conceived of the Superdome while attempting to convince the NFL to award a franchise to New Orleans.", "Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge": "28\u00b021\u203213\u2033N 81\u00b036\u203210\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff28.353637\u00b0N 81.602756\u00b0W\ufeff / 28.353637;

Parks, Experiences and Products..Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge is located in the Animal Kingdom Resort Area, adjacent to Disney's Animal Kingdom.It gives guests the opportunity to view grazing wildlife outside their rooms and public areas in the resort within proximity of the animals, conveying the feeling of being in an African savanna..This hotel was designed by Denver architect Peter Dominick of Urban Design Group (now 4240 Architecture), who also designed Disney's Wilderness Lodge and Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa.[1].On October 11, 2006, Disney announced to local media that Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge would become home to the newest Disney Vacation Club property, Disney's Animal Kingdom Villas.On February 18, 2008, Disney announced the first phase of this expansion was complete and included 109 rooms.[2].A separate building named Kidani Village[3] was built to the west of the lodge and houses more than 300 villas.The Sunset Savanna was extended to the new structure and more species of animals were introduced.A new pool was built and features water slides and an aquatic playground.[4].", "People's Party (United States)": "The People's Party, also known as the Populist Party or simply the Populists, was a left-wing[2] agrarian populist[3] political party in the United States in the late 19th century.The Populist Party emerged in the early 1890s as an important force in the Southern and Western United States, but collapsed after it nominated Democrat William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 United States presidential election.A rump faction of the party continued to operate into the first decade of the 20th century, but never matched the popularity of the party in the early 1890s..The Populist Party's roots lay in the Farmers' Alliance, an agrarian movement that promoted economic action during the Gilded Age, as well as the Greenback Party, an earlier third party that had advocated fiat money.The success of Farmers' Alliance candidates in the 1890 elections, along with the conservatism of both major parties, encouraged Farmers' Alliance leaders to establish a full-fledged third party before the 1892 elections.The Ocala Demands laid out the Populist platform: collective bargaining, federal regulation of railroad rates, an expansionary monetary policy, and a Sub-Treasury Plan that required the establishment of federally controlled warehouses to aid farmers.Other Populist-endorsed measures included bimetallism, a graduated income tax, direct election of Senators, a shorter workweek, and the establishment of a postal savings system.These measures were collectively designed to curb the influence of monopolistic corporate and financial interests and empower small businesses, farmers and laborers..In the 1892 presidential election, the Populist ticket of James B.Weaver and James G.Field won 8.5% of the popular vote and carried four Western states, becoming the first third party since the end of the American Civil War to win electoral votes.Despite the support of labor organizers like Eugene V.", "Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor": "A series of events led to the attack on Pearl Harbor.War between the Empire of Japan and the United States was a possibility each nation's military forces had planned for after World War I.The expansion of American territories in the Pacific had been a threat to Japan since the 1890s, but real tensions did not begin until the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931..Japan's fear of being colonized and the government's expansionist policies led to its own imperialism in Asia and the Pacific, as it sought to join the great powers, all of which were Western nations.The Japanese government saw it necessary to become a colonial power in order to be modern and therefore Western.[1][2] In addition, resentment was fanned in Japan by the rejection of the Japanese Racial Equality Proposal in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, as well as by a series of racist laws, which enforced segregation and barred Asian people (including Japanese) from citizenship, land ownership, and immigration to the U.S.[2].In the 1930s, Japan expanded slowly into China, which led to the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.In 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to embargo all imports into China, including war supplies that were purchased from the U.S.That move prompted the U.S.to embargo all oil exports, which led the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) to estimate it had less than two years of bunker oil remaining and to support the existing plans to seize oil resources in the Dutch East Indies..Planning had been underway for some time on an attack on the \"Southern Resource Area\" to add it to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Japan envisioned in the Pacific..The Philippines, then an American protectorate, were also a Japanese target.The Japanese military concluded that an invasion of the Philippines would provoke an American military response.", "Stapler": "A stapler is a mechanical device that joins pages of paper or similar material by driving a thin metal staple through the sheets and folding the ends.Staplers are widely used in government, business, offices, work places, homes and schools.[1].The word \"stapler\" can actually refer to a number of different devices of varying uses.In addition to joining paper sheets together, staplers can also be used in a surgical setting to join tissue together with surgical staples to close a surgical wound (much in the same way as sutures).[2].Most staplers are used to join multiple sheets of paper.Paper staplers come in two distinct types: manual and electric.Manual staplers are normally hand-held, although models that are used while set on a desk or other surface are not uncommon.Electric staplers exist in a variety of different designs and models.Their primary operating function is to join large numbers of paper sheets together in rapid succession.Some electric staplers can join up to 20 sheets at a time.[3]  Typical staplers are a third-class lever..The growing uses of paper in the 19th century created a demand for an efficient paper fastener.[4].In 1866, George McGill received U.S.", "Swallowing": "Swallowing, sometimes called deglutition in scientific contexts, is the process in the human or animal body that allows for a substance to pass from the mouth, to the pharynx, and into the esophagus, while shutting the epiglottis.Swallowing is an important part of eating and drinking.If the process fails and the material (such as food, drink, or medicine) goes through the trachea, then choking or pulmonary aspiration can occur.In the human body the automatic temporary closing of the epiglottis is controlled by the swallowing reflex..The portion of food, drink, or other material that will move through the neck in one swallow is called a bolus..In colloquial English, the term \"swallowing\" is also used to describe the action of taking in a large mouthful of food without any biting, where the word gulping is more adequate..Swallowing comes so easily to most people that the process rarely prompts much thought.However, from the viewpoints of physiology, of speech\u2013language pathology, and of health care for people with difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia), it is an interesting topic with extensive scientific literature..Eating and swallowing are complex neuromuscular activities consisting essentially of three phases, an oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phase.Each phase is controlled by a different neurological mechanism.The oral phase, which is entirely voluntary, is mainly controlled by the medial temporal lobes and limbic system of the cerebral cortex with contributions from the motor cortex and other cortical areas.The pharyngeal swallow is started by the oral phase and subsequently is coordinated by the swallowing center on the medulla oblongata and pons.", "Thaddeus Stevens": "Thaddeus Stevens (April 4, 1792\u2013 August 11, 1868) was an American politician and lawyer who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania, being one of the leaders of the Radical Republican faction of the Republican Party during the 1860s.A fierce opponent of slavery and discrimination against black Americans, Stevens sought to secure their rights during Reconstruction, leading the opposition to U.S.President Andrew Johnson.As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee during the American Civil War, he played a leading role, focusing his attention on defeating the Confederacy, financing the war with new taxes and borrowing, crushing the power of slave owners, ending slavery, and securing equal rights for the freedmen..Stevens was born in rural Vermont, in poverty, and with a club foot, which left him with a permanent limp.He moved to Pennsylvania as a young man and quickly became a successful lawyer in Gettysburg.He interested himself in municipal affairs and then in politics.He was an active leader of the Anti-Masonic Party, as a fervent believer that Freemasonry in the United States was an evil conspiracy to secretly control the republican system of government.He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, where he became a strong advocate of free public education.Financial setbacks in 1842 caused him to move his home and practice to the larger city of Lancaster.There, he joined the Whig Party and was elected to Congress in 1848.His activities as a lawyer and politician in opposition to slavery cost him votes, and he did not seek reelection in 1852.", "Translation (biology)": "In biology, translation is the process in living cells in which proteins are produced using RNA molecules as templates.The generated protein is a sequence of amino acids.This sequence is determined by the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA.The nucleotides are considered three at a time.Each such triple results in addition of one specific amino acid to the protein being generated.The matching from nucleotide triple to amino acid is called the genetic code.The translation is performed by a large complex of functional RNA and proteins called ribosomes.The entire process is called gene expression..In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded in a ribosome, outside the nucleus, to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide.The polypeptide later folds into an active protein and performs its functions in the cell.The ribosome facilitates decoding by inducing the binding of complementary tRNA anticodon sequences to mRNA codons.The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is \"read\" by the ribosome..", "Multimedia Messaging Service": "Multimedia Messaging Service  (MMS) is a standard way to send messages that include multimedia content to and from a mobile phone over a cellular network.Users and providers may refer to such a message as a PXT, a picture message, or a multimedia message.[1] The MMS standard extends the core SMS (Short Message Service) capability, allowing the exchange of text messages greater than 160 characters in length.Unlike text-only SMS, MMS can deliver a variety of media, including up to forty seconds of video, one image, a slideshow[2] of multiple images, or audio..The most common use involves sending photographs from camera-equipped handsets.[citation needed][needs update] Media companies have utilized MMS on a commercial basis as a method of delivering news and entertainment content, and retailers have deployed it as a tool for delivering scannable coupon codes, product images, videos, and other information..The 3GPP and WAP groups fostered the development of the MMS standard, which is now continued by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)..Multimedia messaging service was built using the technology of SMS messaging, first developed in 1984[2] as a captive technology which enabled service providers to \"collect a fee every time anyone snaps a photo.\"[3].The commercial introduction of MMS started in March 2002.[4].Between 2010 and 2013, MMS traffic in the U.S.increased by 70% from 57 billion to 96 billion messages sent.[5] This is due in part to the wide adoption of smartphones..MMS messages are delivered in a different way from SMS.The first step is for the sending device to encode the multimedia content in a fashion similar to sending a MIME message (MIME content formats are defined in the MMS Message Encapsulation specification).The message is then forwarded to the carrier's MMS store and forward server, known as the MMSC (Multimedia Messaging Service Centre).", "Smallpox": "Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by variola virus (often called smallpox virus)  which belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus.[7][11] The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977, and the World Health Organization (WHO) certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980,[10] making smallpox the only human disease to be eradicated.[12].The initial symptoms of the disease included fever and vomiting.[5] This was followed by formation of ulcers in the mouth and a skin rash.[5] Over a number of days, the skin rash turned into the characteristic fluid-filled blisters with a dent in the center.[5] The bumps then scabbed over and fell off, leaving scars.[5] The disease was transmitted from one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person or (rarely) via contaminated objects.[6][13][14] Prevention was achieved mainly through the smallpox vaccine.[9] Once the disease had developed, certain antiviral medications could potentially have helped, but such medications did not become available until after the disease was eradicated.[9] The risk of death was about 30%, with higher rates among babies.[6][15] Often, those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin, and some were left blind.[6].The earliest evidence of the disease dates to around 1500 BC in Egyptian mummies.[16][17] The disease historically occurred in outbreaks.[10] In 18th-century Europe, it is estimated that 400,000 people died from the disease per year, and that one-third of all cases of blindness were due to smallpox.[10][18] Smallpox is estimated to have killed up to 300million people in the 20th century[19][20] and around 500million people in the last 100 years of its existence.[21] Earlier deaths included six European monarchs.[10][18] As recently as 1967, 15million cases occurred a year.[10].Inoculation for smallpox appears to have started in China around the 1500s.[22][23] Europe adopted this practice from Asia in the first half of the 18th century.[24] In 1796, Edward Jenner introduced the modern smallpox vaccine.[25][26] In 1967, the WHO intensified efforts to eliminate the disease.[10] Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated, the other being rinderpest (a disease of even-toed ungulates) in 2011.[27][28] The term \"smallpox\" was first used in England in the 16th century to distinguish the disease from syphilis, which was then known as the \"great pox\".[29][30] Other historical names for the disease include pox, speckled monster, and red plague.[3][4][30].There are two forms of the smallpox.Variola major is the severe and most common form, with a more extensive rash and higher fever.Variola minor is a less common presentation, causing less severe disease, typically discrete smallpox, with historical death rates of 1% or less.[32] Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common.[33] In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons.This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by viral culture.[33] In addition, there were two very rare and fulminating types of smallpox, the malignant (flat) and hemorrhagic forms, which were usually fatal..The initial symptoms were similar to other viral diseases that are still extant, such as influenza and the common cold: fever of at least 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F), muscle pain, malaise, headache and fatigue.As the digestive tract was commonly involved, nausea, vomiting, and backache often occurred.The early prodromal stage usually lasted 2\u20134 days.By days 12\u201315, the first visible lesions \u2013 small reddish spots called enanthem \u2013 appeared on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, palate, and throat, and the temperature fell to near-normal.", "I Want to Hold Your Hand": "\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles.Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and recorded on 17 October 1963, it was the first Beatles record to be made using four-track equipment..With advance orders exceeding one million copies in the United Kingdom, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" would have gone straight to the top of the British record charts on its day of release (29 November 1963) had it not been blocked by the group's first million-seller \"She Loves You\", their previous UK single, which was having a resurgence of popularity following intense media coverage of the group.Taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" stayed at number one for five weeks and remained in the UK top 50 for 21 weeks in total.[3].It was also the group's first American number-one hit, entering the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 18 January 1964 at number 45 and starting the British Invasion of the American music industry.By 1 February it topped the Hot 100, and stayed there for seven weeks before being replaced by \"She Loves You\".It remained on the Billboard chart for 15 weeks.[4] \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" became the Beatles' best-selling single worldwide, selling more than 12 million copies.[5] In 2018, Billboard magazine named it the 48th biggest hit of all time on the Billboard Hot 100.[6] In the UK, it was the second-highest-selling single of the 1960s, behind \"She Loves You\".[7].Capitol Records' rejection of the group's recordings in the US was now Brian Epstein's main concern, and he encouraged Lennon and McCartney to write a song to appeal specifically to the American market.[8] George Martin, however, had no such explicit recollections, believing that Capitol were left with no alternative but to release \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" due to increasing demand for the group's product.[9].McCartney had recently moved into 57 Wimpole Street, London, where he was lodging as a guest of Dr Richard and Margaret Asher, and whose daughter, actress Jane Asher, had become McCartney's girlfriend earlier in the year.This location briefly became Lennon and McCartney's new writing base, taking over from McCartney's Forthlin Road home in Liverpool.[10] Margaret Asher taught the oboe in the \"small, rather stuffy music room\" in the basement[10] where Lennon and McCartney sat at the piano and composed \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\".In September 1980, Lennon told Playboy magazine:.We wrote a lot of stuff together, one on one, eyeball to eyeball.", "Gasser (car)": "A gasser is a type of hot rod car originally used for drag racing.This style of custom car build originated in United States in the late 1950s and continued until the early 1970s.[1][2] In the days before Pro Stock, the A/Gas cars were the fastest stock-appearing racers around.[3].Gassers are based on closed body production models[Note 1] from the 1930s to mid-1960s, which have been stripped of extraneous weight and jacked up using a beam axle or tubular axle to provide better weight distribution on acceleration (beam axles are also lighter than an independent front suspension), though a raised stock front suspension is common as well.Common weight reduction techniques include fiberglass body panels, stripped interiors, and Lexan windows (sometimes color tinted)..The 1933-36 Willys coup\u00e9s and pickups were very popular gassers.[4] The best-known would be the 1933 Willys 77.[4]  While neither cheap nor plentiful, it was a competitive and lightweight choice satisfying the rules of the era (which required a ladder frame).At least one gasser incorporated a Willys frame in a Ford body to placate their sponsor while keeping it track-legal.[5] [4] Keith Ferrell's Dogcatcher, for instance, was a 1936 delivery with a fuel injected small-block Chevrolet, built for the class; in 1967, Ferrell deliberately left something off to run it in B/Altered (later, with a supercharger, in BB/A).[6].After the company revived, the 1937-42 coup\u00e9s, sedans, and pickups were again popular with hot rodders and gasser teams, and again, comparatively low production leaves unexplained why they gained so much attention.[4]  Ollie Olsen's 1940 coup\u00e9 Wil-A-Meaner (driven by Bob \"Rapid\" Dwyer[citation needed]) won the 1961 Nationals' A/G title.[4][7]  Between 1962 and 1964, the Hassel & Vogelsong 1940 coup\u00e9 \"was the scourge of B/Gas\", winning the 1963 and 1964 Nationals and setting a 1964 national record at 11.34.[8] In 1967, the Hrudka Brothers' 1933 panel delivery was a popular wheelstander.[8].Postwar Willyses were also used (such as the Bremerton, Washington-based Speed Sport Specialties 1954 Willys in B/Gas), but, despite being a better chassis than the 1955-7 Chevrolet, were never as popular as the prewar cars.[9].Combinations could be unusual.Fujimo, Too! was a B/G 1950 Plymouth business coup\u00e9 (run by Adler and Trout) with an injected Oldsmobile and Hydro-Motive transmission.[10].NHRA first licensed women drivers in gas classes in 1963, when Roberta Leighton, member of the Dust Devils Car Club and driver of an injected El Camino, was first admitted.[11].Throughout the 1960s, the Stickle and Riffle Anglia, based out of the Rod Shop and driven by Bob Riffle, were frequent winners.", "Electrocardiography": "Electrocardiography is the process of producing an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG[a]), a recording of the heart's electrical activity through repeated cardiac cycles.[4] It is an electrogram of the heart which is a graph of voltage versus time of the electrical activity of the heart[5] using electrodes placed on the skin.These electrodes detect the small electrical changes that are a consequence of cardiac muscle depolarization followed by repolarization during each cardiac cycle (heartbeat).Changes in the normal ECG pattern occur in numerous cardiac abnormalities, including cardiac rhythm disturbances (such as atrial fibrillation[6] and ventricular tachycardia[7]), inadequate coronary artery blood flow (such as myocardial ischemia[8] and myocardial infarction[9]), and electrolyte disturbances (such as hypokalemia[10] and hyperkalemia[11])..Traditionally, \"ECG\" usually means a 12-lead ECG taken while lying down as discussed below..However, other devices can record the electrical activity of the heart such as a Holter monitor but also some models of smartwatch are capable of recording an ECG..ECG signals can be recorded in other contexts with other devices..In a conventional 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes are placed on the patient's limbs and on the surface of the chest.The overall magnitude of the heart's electrical potential is then measured from twelve different angles (\"leads\") and is recorded over a period of time (usually ten seconds).In this way, the overall magnitude and direction of the heart's electrical depolarization is captured at each moment throughout the cardiac cycle.[12].There are three main components to an ECG: the P wave, which represents depolarization of the atria; the QRS complex, which represents depolarization of the ventricles; and the T wave, which represents repolarization of the ventricles.[13].During each heartbeat, a healthy heart has an orderly progression of depolarization that starts with pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, spreads throughout the atrium, and passes through the atrioventricular node down into the bundle of His and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading down and to the left throughout the ventricles.[13] This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic ECG tracing.To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a large amount of information about the structure of the heart and the function of its electrical conduction system.[14] Among other things, an ECG can be used to measure the rate and rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the heart chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart's muscle cells or conduction system, the effects of heart drugs, and the function of implanted pacemakers.[15].", "Donald trump": "Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021..Trump received a Bachelor of Science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968, and his father named him president of his real estate business in 1971.Trump renamed it the Trump Organization and expanded its operations to building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses.After a series of business reversals in the late twentieth century, he successfully launched side ventures that required little capital, mostly by licensing the Trump name.From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice.He and his businesses have been plaintiff or defendant in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six business bankruptcies..Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican nominee against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote.[a] During the campaign, his political positions were described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist.His election and policies sparked numerous protests.He was the first U.S.president with no prior military or government experience.The 2017\u20132019 special counsel investigation established that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to favor Trump's campaign.Trump promoted conspiracy theories and made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics.", "A Change Is Gonna Come": "\"A Change Is Gonna Come\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Sam Cooke.It initially appeared on Cooke's album Ain't That Good News, released mid-February 1964[1] by RCA Victor; a slightly edited version of the recording was released as a single on December 22, 1964.Produced by Hugo & Luigi and arranged and conducted by Ren\u00e9 Hall, the song was the B-side to \"Shake\"..The song was inspired by various events in Cooke's life, most prominently when he and his entourage were turned away from a whites-only motel in Louisiana.Cooke felt compelled to write a song that spoke to his struggle and of those around him, and that pertained to the Civil Rights Movement and African Americans..Though only a modest hit for Cooke in comparison with his previous singles, \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" is widely considered one of Cooke's greatest and most influential compositions and has been voted among the greatest songs ever released by various publications.In 2007, the song was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress, with the National Recording Registry deeming the song \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important.\"[2] In 2021, it appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, ranked at No.3.[3].On October 8, 1963, en route to Shreveport, Louisiana, Cooke called ahead to the Holiday Inn North to make reservations for his wife, Barbara, and himself, but when he and his group arrived, the desk clerk glanced nervously and explained there were no vacancies.[4] While his brother Charles protested, Sam was furious, yelling to see the manager and refusing to leave until he received an answer.His wife nudged him, attempting to calm him down, telling him, \"They'll kill you,\" to which he responded, \"They ain't gonna kill me, because I'm Sam Cooke.\"[4] When they eventually persuaded Cooke to leave, the group drove away calling out insults and blaring their horns.When they arrived at the Castle Motel on Sprague Street downtown, the police were waiting for them, arresting them for disturbing the peace.[4] The New York Times ran a UPI report the next day, headlined \"Negro Band Leader Held in Shreveport,\"[5] but African-Americans were outraged.In 2019, then-Shreveport mayor Adrian Perkins apologized to Cooke's family for the event, and posthumously awarded Cooke the key to the city.[6].", "Geothermal energy": "Geothermal energy is thermal energy in the Earth's crust.It combines energy from the formation of the planet and from radioactive decay.Geothermal energy has been exploited as a source of heat and/or electric power for millennia..Geothermal heating, using water from hot springs, for example, has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since Roman times.Geothermal power, (generation of electricity from geothermal energy), has been used since the 20th century.Unlike wind and solar energy, geothermal plants produce power at a constant rate, without regard to weather conditions.Geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs.Most extraction occurs in areas near tectonic plate boundaries..The cost of generating geothermal power decreased by 25% during the 1980s and 1990s.[1] Technological advances continued to reduce costs and thereby expand the amount of viable resources.In 2021, the U.S.Department of Energy estimated that power from a plant \"built today\" costs about $0.05/kWh.[2].In 2019, 13,900 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power was available worldwide.[3] An additional 28 gigawatts provided heat for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination, and agricultural applications as of 2010.[4].", "Ownership": "Ownership is the state or fact of legal possession and control over property, which may be any asset, tangible or intangible.Ownership can involve multiple rights, collectively referred to as title, which may be separated and held by different parties..The process and mechanics of ownership are fairly complex: one can gain, transfer, and lose ownership of property in a number of ways.To acquire property one can purchase it with money, trade it for other property, win it in a bet, receive it as a gift, inherit it, find it, receive it as damages, earn it by doing work or performing services, make it, or homestead it.One can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money, exchanging it for other property, giving it as a gift, misplacing it, or having it stripped from one's ownership through legal means such as eviction, foreclosure, seizure, or taking.Ownership implies that the owner of a property also owns any economic benefits or deficits associated with the property..Over the millennia and across cultures, notions regarding what constitutes \"property\" and how it is treated culturally have varied widely.Ownership is the basis for many other concepts that form the foundations of ancient and modern societies such as money, trade, debt, bankruptcy, the criminality of theft, and private vs.public property.Ownership is the key building block in the development of the capitalist socio-economic system.[1] Adam Smith stated that one of the sacred laws of justice was to guard a person's property and possessions.[2].Individuals may own property directly.In some societies only adult men may own property;[3][failed verification] in other societies (such as the Haudenosaunee), property is matrilinear and passed on from mother to the offspring.[4] In most societies both men and women can own property with no restrictions and limitations at all.[5].", "What's My Name? (Rihanna song)": "\"What's My Name?\" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna, for her fifth studio album Loud (2010).Featuring guest vocals from Canadian rapper Drake, the song was released as the second single from Loud on October 25, 2010, through Def Jam Recordings.The dancehall-infused electro-R&B song was produced by the Norwegian production duo Stargate, and was written by the duo along with Ester Dean, Traci Hale, and Drake.Lyrically, it incorporates themes of romance and sex..In Germany released in January 21,2011 is a single.\"What's My Name?\" topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, giving Rihanna her third number-one single in 2010, as well as her eighth overall on the chart.The song also topped the charts in Hungary and the United Kingdom and reached the top five in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and Slovakia.The song received a nomination at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.[1].An accompanying music video, directed by Philip Andelman, plays a romantic encounter between Rihanna and Drake in a grocery store along with romantic scenes between the pair and Rihanna walking through Manhattan's Lower East Side.\"What's My Name?\" was promoted with live performances, including Saturday Night Live in the United States and the series 7 finale of The X Factor in the United Kingdom released in 2011.In November 2009, in an interview with MTV News, Canadian rapper Drake praised Rihanna's then-upcoming fourth studio album, Rated R (2009).During the same interview, he revealed that they have collaborated on a track that didn't make the final cut on the album, \"the record we have is great.", "Mathematical constant": "A mathematical constant is a key number whose value is fixed by an unambiguous definition, often referred to by a special symbol (e.g., an alphabet letter), or by mathematicians' names to facilitate using it across multiple mathematical problems.[1] Constants arise in many areas of mathematics, with constants such as e and \u03c0 occurring in such diverse contexts as geometry, number theory, statistics, and calculus..Some constants arise naturally by a fundamental principle or intrinsic property, such as the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle (\u03c0).Other constants are notable more for historical reasons than for their mathematical properties.The more popular constants have been studied throughout the ages and computed to many decimal places..All named mathematical constants are definable numbers, and usually are also computable numbers (Chaitin's constant being a significant exception)..These are constants which one is likely to encounter during pre-college education in many countries..The constant \u03c0 (pi) has a natural definition in Euclidean geometry as the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle.It may be found in many other places in mathematics: for example, the Gaussian integral, the complex roots of unity, and Cauchy distributions in probability.However, its ubiquity is not limited to pure mathematics.It appears in many formulas in physics, and several physical constants are most naturally defined with \u03c0 or its reciprocal factored out.For example, the ground state wave function of the hydrogen atom is.where.", "United States Senate elections, 2010": "The 2010 United States Senate elections were held on November 2, 2010, from among the United States Senate's 100 seats.A special election was held on January 19, 2010, for a mid-term vacancy in Massachusetts.Thirty-four of the November elections were for six-year terms to the Senate's Class 3, while other three were special elections to finish incomplete terms.Those 37 November elections featured 19 incumbent Democrats (seven of whom retired or were defeated in the primary) and 18 incumbent Republicans (eight of whom retired or were defeated in the primary)..After the 2008 elections, the Senate was composed of 58 Democrats, 40 Republicans, and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats.However, in a January 2010 special election, Republicans picked up a seat in Massachusetts thereby reducing Democrats' majority to 57 seats..Republicans won four seats held by retiring Democrats and also defeated two incumbent Democrats, for a Republican net gain of six seats.This was the first time since 1994 that Republicans successfully defended all of their own seats.This was also the fourth consecutive election of Class 3 senators where Democrats failed to gain seats.Despite the Republican gains, the Democrats retained a majority of the Senate with 51 seats plus the two independents who caucused with them, compared to the 47 Republican seats.As of 2023[update], this was the last time Republicans won U.S.Senate seats in Illinois and New Hampshire..", "Solstice": "A solstice is an event that occurs when the Sun appears to reach its most northerly or southerly excursion relative to the celestial equator on the celestial sphere.Two solstices occur annually, around June 21 and December 21.In many countries, the seasons of the year are determined by the solstices and the equinoxes..The term solstice can also be used in a broader sense, as the day when this occurs.The day of a solstice in either hemisphere has either the most sunlight of the year (summer solstice) or the least sunlight of the year (winter solstice) for any place other than the Equator.Alternative terms, with no ambiguity as to which hemisphere is the context, are \"June solstice\" and \"December solstice\", referring to the months in which they take place every year.[7].The word solstice is derived from the Latin sol (\"sun\") and sistere (\"to stand still\"), because at the solstices, the Sun's declination appears to \"stand still\"; that is, the seasonal movement of the Sun's daily path (as seen from Earth) pauses at a northern or southern limit before reversing direction..For an observer at the North Pole, the Sun reaches the highest position in the sky once a year in June.The day this occurs is called the June solstice day.Similarly, for an observer on the South Pole, the Sun reaches the highest position on the December solstice day.When it is the summer solstice at one Pole, it is the winter solstice on the other.The Sun's westerly motion never ceases as Earth is continually in rotation.", "Jerry Lee Lewis": "Jerry Lee Lewis (September 29, 1935\u2013 October 28, 2022) was an American pianist, singer and songwriter.Nicknamed \"The Killer\", he was described as \"rock 'n' roll's first great wild man\".A pioneer of rock 'n' roll and rockabilly music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at Cosimo Matassa's J&M Studio in New Orleans, Louisiana, and early recordings in 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee.\"Crazy Arms\" sold 300,000 copies in the Southern United States, but it was his 1957 hit \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" that shot Lewis to worldwide fame.He followed this with the major hits \"Great Balls of Fire\", \"Breathless\", and \"High School Confidential\"..His rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to Myra Gale Brown, his 13-year-old first cousin once removed.His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal, and with few exceptions, such as a cover of Ray Charles's \"What'd I Say\", he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s.His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic.His 1964 live album Live at the Star Club, Hamburg is regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever.In 1968, Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as \"Another Place, Another Time\".This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis had 30 songs reach the Top 10 on the Billboard Country and Western Chart.[7] His No.1 country hits included \"To Make Love Sweeter for You\", \"There Must Be More to Love Than This\", \"Would You Take Another Chance on Me\", and \"Me and Bobby McGee\"..", "Emancipation Proclamation": "The Emancipation Proclamation, officially Proclamation 95,[2][3] was a presidential proclamation and executive order issued by United States President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, during the American Civil War.The Proclamation had the effect of changing the legal status of more than 3.5 million enslaved African Americans in the secessionist Confederate states from enslaved to free.As soon as slaves escaped the control of their enslavers, either by fleeing to Union lines or through the advance of federal troops, they were permanently free.In addition, the Proclamation allowed for former slaves to \"be received into the armed service of the United States\".The Emancipation Proclamation was a significant part of the end of slavery in the United States..On September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.[4] Its third paragraph reads:.That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom..On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the final Emancipation Proclamation.[5] After quoting from the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, it stated:.I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief, of the Army and Navy of the United States in time of actual armed rebellion against authority and government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion, do ...order and designate as the States and parts of States wherein the people thereof respectively, are this day in rebellion, against the United States, the following, towit:.Lincoln then listed the ten states[6] still in rebellion, excluding parts of states under Union control, and continued:.I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States, and parts of States, are, and henceforward shall be free....", "Sucker Punch (film)": "A

photographs in digital memory.Most cameras produced today are digital,[1] largely replacing those that capture images on photographic film.Digital cameras are now widely incorporated into mobile devices like smartphones with the same or more capabilities and features of dedicated cameras (which are still available).[2] High-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals and those who desire to take higher-quality photographs.[3].Digital and digital movie cameras share an optical system, typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device.[4] The diaphragm and shutter admit a controlled amount of light to the image, just as with film, but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical.However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory.Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound.Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing..The first semiconductor image sensor was the charge-coupled device (CCD), invented by Willard S.Boyle and George E.Smith at Bell Labs in 1969,[5] based on MOS capacitor technology.[6] The NMOS active-pixel sensor was later invented by Tsutomu Nakamura's team at Olympus in 1985,[7][8][9] which led to the development of the CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1993.[10][8].In the 1960s, Eugene F.Lally of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was thinking about how to use a mosaic photosensor to capture digital images.", "Web server": "A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS.A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message.A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.[1][2].The hardware used to run a web server can vary according to the volume of requests that it needs to handle.At the low end of the range are embedded systems, such as a router that runs a small web server as its configuration interface.A high-traffic Internet website might handle requests with hundreds of servers that run on racks of high-speed computers..A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file (static content) available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates with the server software.The former usually can be served faster and can be more easily cached for repeated requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications..Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the application of web servers well beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages..This is a very brief history of web server programs, so some information necessarily overlaps with the histories of the web browsers, the World Wide Web and the Internet; therefore, for the sake of clarity and understandability, some key historical information below reported may be similar to that found also in one or more of the above-mentioned history articles..In March 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposed a new project to his employer CERN, with the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system.The proposal titled \"HyperText and CERN\", asked for comments and it was read by several people.", "American Red Cross": "The American Red Cross (ARC), also known as the American National Red Cross,[5] is a nonprofit humanitarian organization that provides emergency assistance, disaster relief, and disaster preparedness education in the United States.It is the designated US affiliate of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the United States movement to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement..The organization offers services and development programs.[6].Clara Barton established the American Red Cross in Dansville, New York, on May 21, 1881, and was also the organization's first president.She organized a meeting on May 12 of that year at the house of Senator Omar D.Conger (R, MI).[7] Fifteen people were present at the meeting, Conger and Representative William Lawrence (R, OH) (who became the first vice president) to discuss the start of the American Red Cross.[8][9] The first local chapter was established in 1881 at the English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Dansville.[10][11][12].Jane Delano (1862\u20131919) founded the American Red Cross Nursing Service on January 20, 1910.[13].Barton founded the American chapter after learning of the Red Cross in Geneva, Switzerland.In 1869, she went to Europe and became involved in the work of the International Red Cross during the Franco-Prussian War.She was determined to bring the organization to America.[14][15].Barton became President of the American branch of the society, known as the American National Red Cross in May 1881 in Washington.The first chapters opened in upstate New York, where she had connections.[16][15] John D.", "Rooster": "The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from Southeast Asia.They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.A male that has been castrated is a capon.An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places.Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers..Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[update],[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.There are numerous cultural references to chickens\u2014in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature..Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean.", "Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Trading Card Game": "", "Land Rover": "Land Rover is a British brand of predominantly four-wheel drive, off-road capable vehicles, owned by multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), since 2008 a subsidiary of India's Tata Motors.[3] JLR currently builds Land Rovers in Brazil, China, India, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom.The Land Rover name was created in 1948 by the Rover Company for a utilitarian 4WD off-road vehicle; currently, the Land Rover range consists solely of upmarket and luxury sport utility vehicles..Land Rover was granted a Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1951,[4][5] and 50 years later, in 2001, it received a Queen's Award for Enterprise for outstanding contribution to international trade.[6] Over time, Land Rover grew into its own brand (and for a while also a company), encompassing a consistently growing range of four-wheel drive, off-road capable models.Starting with the much more upmarket 1970 Range Rover, and subsequent introductions of the mid-range Discovery and entry-level Freelander line (in 1989 and 1997), as well as the 1990 Land Rover Defender refresh, the marque today includes two models of Discovery, four distinct models of Range Rover, and after a three-year hiatus, a second generation of Defenders have gone into production for the 2020 model year\u2014in short or long wheelbase, as before..For half a century (from the original 1948 model, through 1997, when the Freelander was introduced), Land Rovers and Range Rovers exclusively relied on their trademark boxed-section vehicle frames.Land Rover used boxed frames in a direct product bloodline until the termination of the original Defender in 2016; and their last body-on-frame model was replaced by a monocoque with the third generation Discovery in 2017.Since then all Land Rovers and Range Rovers have a unified body and frame structure..Since 2010, Land Rover has also introduced two-wheel drive variants, both of the Freelander, and of the Evoque, after having built exclusively 4WD cars for 62 years.[7] The 2WD Freelander has been succeeded by a 2WD Discovery Sport, available in some markets.[8].Originally, these vehicles were simply called the 'Land Rover' \u2013 an off-road capable car model of the Rover Company.As 'Land Rover' became established as a brand, the 'Series' indication later became a retronym model name.[9] The Range Rover was introduced in 1970, and the company became a British Leyland subsidiary in 1978.In 1983 and 1984, the long and the short wheelbase Land Rovers were finally given official names \u2013 the One Ten, and the Ninety respectively, and together they were badged the Defender models in 1990, after the 1989 introduction of the new Discovery model..The design for the original vehicle was started in 1947 by Maurice Wilks.", "List of Bleach episodes (season 9)": "The ninth season of the Bleach anime series is named The New Captain Sh\u016bsuke Amagai arc

States": "The East Coast of the United States, also known as the Eastern Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard, is the region encompassing the coastline where the Eastern United States meets the Atlantic Ocean..The region is generally understood to include the U.S.states that border the Atlantic Ocean: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia, as well as the federal capital of Washington, D.C., and non-coastline states: Pennsylvania, Vermont, and West Virginia.[2].The place name East Coast derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the western edge and one on the eastern edge.Other terms for referring to this area include the Eastern Seaboard, which is another term for coastline,[3] Atlantic Coast, and Atlantic Seaboard because the coastline lies along the Atlantic Ocean..The 14 states that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are (from north to south): Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.[4] Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.border the Delaware River and the Potomac River, respectively, both of which are tidal arms of the Atlantic Ocean..The original Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain in North America all lay along the East Coast.[a].Two additional U.S.states on the East Coast were not among the original Thirteen Colonies: Maine became part of the English Colony of Massachusetts in 1677[5] and Florida was held by the British from the end of the French and Indian War until 1781 and was part of New Spain until 1821..In present-day Florida, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n made the first textual records of the state during his 1513 voyage.The state was initially named for Ponce de Ponce de Le\u00f3n, who called the peninsula La Pascua Florida in recognition of the verdant landscape and because it was the Easter season.[6].", "Sertraline": "Sertraline, sold under the brand name Zoloft among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class.[10] The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of other antidepressants, and the differences are mostly confined to side effects.Sertraline is better tolerated than the older tricyclic antidepressants.Sertraline is effective for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD).However, for OCD, cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly in combination with sertraline, is a better treatment.[citation needed] Although approved for  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sertraline leads to only modest improvement in this condition.[11][12] Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently (luteal phase dosing) for its treatment.[13].Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of diarrhea, nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild.Similar to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a mildly elevated rate of suicidal thoughts in people under the age of 25 years old.It should not be used together with MAO inhibitor medication: this combination may cause serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening in some cases.Sertraline taken during pregnancy is associated with an increase in congenital heart defects in newborns.[14][15].Sertraline was invented and developed by scientists at Pfizer and approved for medical use in the United States in 1991.It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[16] It is available as a generic medication.[10] In 2016, sertraline was the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medication in the United States[17] and in 2020, it was the twelfth most commonly prescribed medication overall in the United States, with over 38million prescriptions.[18][19].Sertraline has been approved for major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder (SAD).Sertraline is approved for use in children with OCD.[20].", "The Five Heartbeats": "The Five Heartbeats is a 1991 musical drama film directed by Robert Townsend, who co-wrote the script with Keenen Ivory Wayans.Produced and distributed by 20th Century Fox, the film's main cast includes Townsend, Michael Wright, Leon Robinson, Harry J.Lennix, Tico Wells, Harold Nicholas, and Diahann Carroll.[1] The plot of the film (which is loosely based on the lives of several artists: The Dells, The Temptations, Four Tops, Wilson Pickett, James Brown, Frankie Lymon, Sam Cooke and others)[7] follows the three decade career of the rhythm and blues vocal group The Five Heartbeats.The film depicts the rise and fall of a Motown inspired soul act through the eyes of one of the Heartbeats, Donald \"Duck\" Matthews..The film was released to most North American audiences on March 29, 1991;[8] however, it was not made available to audiences in other continents until 2002 when a DVD was released.Another DVD was released in 2006 for the film's 15th anniversary.[9] The movie received mixed reviews from critics.[10].Five boys - Donald \"Duck\" Matthews, Anthony \"Choirboy\" Stone, J.T.Matthews, Terrence \"Dresser\" Williams, and Eddie King, Jr.- perform at a Battle of the Bands contest as The Heartbeats.The group loses to Flash and the Ebony Sparks, but pleases the crowd and is noticed by Jimmy Potter.Jimmy offers to manage the group, promising them $100 if they do not win the next month's Battle of the Bands contest.After they lose again, Jimmy pays them.", "Automotive battery": "An automotive battery or car battery is a rechargeable battery that is used to start a motor vehicle.Its main purpose is to provide an electric current to the electric-powered starting motor, which in turn starts the chemically-powered internal combustion engine that actually propels the vehicle.Once the engine is running, power for the car's electrical systems is still supplied by the battery, with the alternator charging the battery as demands increase or decrease..Typically, starting uses less than three percent of the battery capacity.For this reason, automotive batteries are designed to deliver maximum current for a short period of time.They are sometimes referred to as \"SLI batteries\" for this reason, for starting, lighting and ignition.SLI batteries are not designed for deep discharging, and a full discharge can reduce the battery's lifespan.[1].As well as starting the engine, an SLI battery supplies the extra power necessary when the vehicle's electrical requirements exceed the supply from the charging system.It is also a stabilizer, evening out potentially damaging voltage spikes.[2] While the engine is running most of the power is provided by the alternator, which includes a voltage regulator to keep the output between 13.5 and 14.5V.[3] Modern SLI batteries are lead-acid type, using six series-connected cells to provide a nominal 12-volt system (in most passenger vehicles and light trucks), or twelve cells for a 24-volt system in heavy trucks or earth-moving equipment, for example.[4].Gas explosions can occur at the negative electrode where hydrogen gas can build up due to blocked battery vents or a poorly ventilated setting, combined with an ignition source.[5] Explosions during engine start-up are typically associated with corroded or dirty battery posts.[5] A 1993 study by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that 31% of vehicle battery explosion injuries occurred while charging the battery.[6] The next-most common scenarios were while working on cable connections, while jump-starting, typically by failing to connect to the dead battery before the charging source and failing to connect to the vehicle chassis rather than directly to the grounded battery post, and while checking fluid levels.[5][6] Close to two-thirds of those injured suffered chemical burns, and nearly three-fourths suffered eye injuries, among other possible injuries.[6].Electric vehicles (EVs) are powered by a high-voltage electric vehicle battery, but they usually have an automotive battery as well, so that they can use standard automotive accessories which are designed to run on 12V.They are often referred to as auxiliary batteries..", "Full-time": "", "Controlled Substances Act": "The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is the statute establishing federal U.S.drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use, and distribution of certain substances is regulated.It was passed by the 91st United States Congress as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon.[1] The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs..The legislation created five schedules (classifications), with varying qualifications for a substance to be included in each.Two federal agencies, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), determine which substances are added to or removed from the various schedules, although the statute passed by Congress created the initial listing.Congress has sometimes scheduled other substances through legislation such as the Hillory J.Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Prevention Act of 2000, which placed gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) in Schedule I and sodium oxybate (the isolated sodium salt in GHB) in Schedule III when used under an FDA New Drug Application (NDA) or Investigational New Drug (IND).[2][3] Classification decisions are required to be made on criteria including potential for abuse (an undefined term),[4] currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and international treaties.The nation first outlawed addictive drugs in the early 1900s and the International Opium Convention helped lead international agreements regulating trade.[5][6][7] The Food and Drugs Act of 1906 was the beginning of over 200 laws concerning public health and consumer protections.[8] Others were the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (1938), and the Kefauver Harris Amendment of 1962.[9].In 1969, President Richard Nixon announced that the Attorney General, John N.Mitchell, was preparing a comprehensive new measure to more effectively meet the narcotic and dangerous drug problems at the federal level by combining all existing federal laws into a single new statute.With the help of White House Counsel head, John Dean; the Executive Director of the Shafer Commission, Michael Sonnenreich; and the Director of the BNDD, John Ingersoll creating and writing the legislation, Mitchell was able to present Nixon with the bill.[10].The CSA not only combined existing federal drug laws and expanded their scope, but it also changed the nature of federal drug law policies and expanded federal law enforcement pertaining to controlled substances..", "Maya numerals": "The Maya numeral system was the system to represent numbers and calendar dates in the Maya civilization.It was a vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system.The numerals are made up of three symbols: zero (a shell),[1] one (a dot) and five (a bar).For example, thirteen is written as three dots in a horizontal row above two horizontal bars; sometimes it is also written as three vertical dots to the left of two vertical bars.With these three symbols, each of the twenty vigesimal digits could be written..Numbers after 19 were written vertically in powers of twenty.The Maya used powers of twenty, just as the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system uses powers of ten.[2] For example, thirty-three would be written as one dot, above three dots atop two bars.The first dot represents \"one twenty\" or \"1\u00d720\", which is added to three dots and two bars, or thirteen.Therefore, (1\u00d720) + 13 = 33.Upon reaching 202 or 400, another row is started (203 or 8000, then 204 or 160,000, and so on).The number 429 would be written as one dot above one dot above four dots and a bar, or (1\u00d7202) + (1\u00d7201) + 9 = 429..Other than the bar and dot notation, Maya numerals were sometimes illustrated by face type glyphs or pictures.", "Lyndon B. Johnson": "Lyndon Baines Johnson (/\u02c8l\u026and\u0259n \u02c8be\u026anz/; August 27, 1908\u2013January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials LBJ, was an American politician who served as the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969.He became president after the assassination of John F.Kennedy, under whom he had served as the 37th vice president from 1961 to 1963.A Democrat from Texas, Johnson also served as a U.S.representative and U.S.senator.Johnson is one of only three, along with Richard Nixon and Andrew Johnson, to have served in all four federally elected positions of the U.S.government..Born in Stonewall, Texas, Johnson worked as a high school teacher and a congressional aide before winning election to the U.S.House of Representatives in 1937.In 1948, he was controversially declared winner in the Democratic Party's primary for the 1948 Senate election in Texas and won the general election.[1] He became Senate majority whip in 1951, Senate Democratic leader in 1953 and majority leader in 1954.In 1960, Johnson ran for the Democratic presidential nomination.", "Progesterone": "Progesterone (P4) is an endogenous steroid and progestogen sex hormone involved in the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and embryogenesis of humans and other species.[1][13] It belongs to a group of steroid hormones called the progestogens[13] and is the major progestogen in the body.Progesterone has a variety of important functions in the body.It is also a crucial metabolic intermediate in the production of other endogenous steroids, including the sex hormones and the corticosteroids, and plays an important role in brain function as a neurosteroid.[14].In addition to its role as a natural hormone, progesterone is also used as a medication, such as in combination with estrogen for contraception, to reduce the risk of uterine or cervical cancer, in hormone replacement therapy, and in feminizing hormone therapy.[15] It was first prescribed in 1934.[16].Progesterone is the most important progestogen in the body.As a potent agonist of the nuclear progesterone receptor (nPR) (with an affinity of KD = 1 nM) the resulting effects on ribosomal transcription plays a major role in regulation of female reproduction.[13][17] In addition, progesterone is an agonist of the more recently discovered membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs),[18] of which the expression has regulation effects in reproduction function (oocyte maturation, labor, and sperm motility) and cancer although additional research is required to further define the roles.[19] It also functions as a ligand of the PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) which impacts tumor progression, metabolic regulation, and viability control of nerve cells.[20][21][22] Moreover, progesterone is also known to be an antagonist of the sigma \u03c31 receptor,[23][24] a negative allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,[14] and a potent antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).[25] Progesterone prevents MR activation by binding to this receptor with an affinity exceeding even those of aldosterone and glucocorticoids such as cortisol and corticosterone,[25] and produces antimineralocorticoid effects, such as natriuresis, at physiological concentrations.[26] In addition, progesterone binds to and behaves as a partial agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), albeit with very low potency (EC50 >100-fold less relative to cortisol).[27][28].Progesterone, through its neurosteroid active metabolites such as 5\u03b1-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone, acts indirectly as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor.[29].Progesterone and some of its metabolites, such as 5\u03b2-dihydroprogesterone, are agonists of the pregnane X receptor (PXR),[30] albeit weakly so (EC50 >10 \u03bcM).[31] In accordance, progesterone induces several hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes,[32] such as CYP3A4,[33][34] especially during pregnancy when concentrations are much higher than usual.[35] Perimenopausal women have been found to have greater CYP3A4 activity relative to men and postmenopausal women, and it has been inferred that this may be due to the higher progesterone levels present in perimenopausal women.[33].Progesterone modulates the activity of CatSper (cation channels of sperm) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.Since eggs release progesterone, sperm may use progesterone as a homing signal to swim toward eggs (chemotaxis).As a result, it has been suggested that substances that block the progesterone binding site on CatSper channels could potentially be used in male contraception.[36][37].Progesterone has a number of physiological effects that are amplified in the presence of estrogens.", "Big Bird": "Big Bird is a Muppet character designed by Jim Henson and built by Kermit Love for the children's television show Sesame Street.An eight-foot two-inch (249cm) tall bright yellow anthropomorphic bird,[6][7] he can roller skate, ice skate, dance, swim, sing, write poetry, draw, and ride a unicycle.Despite this wide array of talents, he is prone to frequent misunderstandings, on one occasion even singing the alphabet as one long word (from the song called \"ABC-DEF-GHI,\" pronounced

among other mispronunciations.He lives in a large nest behind the 123 Sesame Street brownstone and right next to Oscar the Grouch's trash can.He also has a teddy bear named Radar.In Season 46, Big Bird's large nest is now sitting within a small, furnished maple tree, and is no longer hidden by used construction doors..Caroll Spinney performed Big Bird from 1969 to 2018.Matt Vogel began as an understudy in 1996[8] before becoming the character's full-time performer in 2018..In 2000, Big Bird was named a Living Legend by the United States Library of Congress.[9].", "Webtrends": "Webtrends is a private company headquartered in Portland, Oregon, United States.It provides digital analytics, optimization and software related to digital marketing.and e-commerce.[2] It provides services to approximately 2,000 companies..W.Glen Boyd and Eli Shapira founded the company in 1993 as \"e.g.Software\".[3].NetIQ bought the company in 2001.[4][5] In 2002, NetIQ released a new version of Webtrends Reporting Center (version 5.0).[6] NetIQ sold Webtrends in 2005.[7].On October 31, 2007, three corporate vice presidents and the CEO were asked to resign.[8] Although there was initial speculation the company was to be quickly sold to its largest competitor, later reports indicated the change signaled a long-term move..In February 2014, the company hired Joe Davis as its new CEO.[9] In May 2014, the company moved its headquarters from the Pacific First Center to the U.S.Bancorp Tower in Downtown Portland.[10][11].In 2009, Webtrends launched a transit ad campaign revolving around whether or not cyclists should pay a road tax.The ad asked, \"Should Cyclists Pay A Road Tax?\".[12] Both drivers and the cycling community reacted strongly to the ad, with strident opinion on both sides of the debate.[13] The aim of the campaign was to demonstrate the ability of the company's Web analytics to track the resulting online commentary around the issue.[13].", "Second Crusade": "The Second Crusade (1145\u20131149) was the second major crusade launched from Europe.The Second Crusade was started in response to the fall of the County of Edessa in 1144 to the forces of Zengi.The county had been founded during the First Crusade (1096\u20131099) by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem in 1098.While it was the first Crusader state to be founded, it was also the first to fall..The Second Crusade was announced by Pope Eugene III, and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings, namely Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany, with help from a number of other European nobles.The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe.After crossing Byzantine territory into Anatolia, both armies were separately defeated by the Seljuk Turks.The main Western Christian source, Odo of Deuil, and Syriac Christian sources claim that the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos secretly hindered the crusaders' progress, particularly in Anatolia, where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them.However, this alleged sabotage of the Crusade by the Byzantines was likely fabricated by Odo, who saw the Empire as an obstacle, and moreover Emperor Manuel had no political reason to do so.[1].Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached Jerusalem and participated in 1148 in an ill-advised attack on Damascus, which ended in their retreat.In the end, the crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a victory for the Muslims.It would ultimately have a key influence on the fall of Jerusalem and give rise to the Third Crusade at the end of the 12th century..", "Walmart": "Walmart Inc.( /\u02c8w\u0254\u02d0lm\u0251\u02d0rt/ \u24d8; formerly Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets (also called supercenters), discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas.[10] The company was founded by brothers Sam and James \"Bud\" Walton in nearby Rogers, Arkansas in 1962 and incorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law on October 31, 1969.It also owns and operates Sam's Club retail warehouses.[11][12].As of October31, 2022,[update] Walmart has 10,586 stores and clubs in 24countries, operating under 46 differentnames.[2][3][4] The company operates under the name Walmart in the United States and Canada, as Walmart de M\u00e9xico y Centroam\u00e9rica in Mexico and Central America, and as Flipkart Wholesale in India.It has wholly owned operations in Chile, Canada, and South Africa.Since August 2018, Walmart held only a minority stake in Walmart Brasil, which was renamed Grupo Big in August 2019, with 20 percent of the company's shares, and private equity firm Advent International holding 80% ownership of the company.They eventually divested their shareholdings in Grupo Big to French retailer Carrefour, in transaction worth R$7 billion and completed on June 7, 2022.[13].Walmart is the world's largest company by revenue, with about US$570 billion in annual revenue, according to the Fortune Global 500 list in October 2022.[14] It is also the largest private employer in the world with 2.2million employees.It is a publicly traded family-owned business, as the company is controlled by the Walton family.Sam Walton's heirs own over 50 percent of Walmart through both their holding company Walton Enterprises and their individual holdings.[15] Walmart was the largest United States grocery retailer in 2019, and 65 percent of Walmart's US$510.329billion sales came from U.S.operations.[16][17].Walmart was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972.", "Gary Moore": "Robert William Gary Moore (4 April 1952\u2013 6 February 2011) was a Northern Irish musician.Over the course of his career he played in various groups and performed a range of music including blues, blues rock, hard rock, heavy metal, and jazz fusion..Influenced by Peter Green and Eric Clapton, Moore began his career in the late 1960s when he joined Skid Row, with whom he released two albums.After Moore left the group he joined Thin Lizzy, featuring his former Skid Row bandmate and frequent collaborator Phil Lynott.Moore began his solo career in the 1970s and achieved major success with 1979's \"Parisienne Walkways\", which is considered his signature song.During the 1980s, Moore transitioned into playing hard rock and heavy metal with varying degrees of international success.In 1990, he returned to his roots with Still Got the Blues, which became the most successful album of his career.Moore continued to release new music throughout his later career, collaborating with other artists from time to time.Moore died on 6 February 2011 from a heart attack while on holiday in Spain..Moore was often described as a virtuoso and has been cited as an influence by many other guitar players.He was voted as one of the greatest guitarists of all time on respective lists by Total Guitar and Louder.Irish singer-songwriter Bob Geldof said that \"without question, [Moore] was one of the great Irish bluesmen\".[1] For most of his career, Moore was heavily associated with Peter Green's famed 1959 Gibson Les Paul guitar.", "Web hosting service": "A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that hosts websites for clients, i.e.it offers the facilities required for them to create and maintain a site and makes it accessible on the World Wide Web.Companies providing web hosting services are sometimes called web hosts..Typically, web hosting requires the following:.Until 1991, the Internet was restricted to use only \"...for research and education in the sciences and engineering...\"[1][2] and was used for email, telnet, FTP and USENET traffic\u2014but only a tiny number of web pages.The World Wide Web protocols had only just been written[3] and not until the end of 1993 would there be a graphical web browser for Mac or Windows computers.[4] Even after there was some opening up of Internet access, the situation was confused[clarification needed] until 1995.[5].To host a website on the internet, an individual or company would need their own computer or server.[6] As not all companies had the budget or expertise to do this, web hosting services began to offer to host users' websites on their own servers, without the client needing to own the necessary infrastructure required to operate the website.The owners of the websites, also called webmasters, would be able to create a website that would be hosted on the web hosting service's server and published to the web by the web hosting service..As the number of users on the World Wide Web grew, the pressure for companies, both large and small, to have an online presence grew.By 1995, companies such as GeoCities, Angelfire and Tripod were offering free hosting.[7].The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting, where files can be uploaded via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or a web interface.", "Obstetrics": "Obstetrics is the field of study concentrated on pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period.[1] As a medical specialty, obstetrics is combined with gynecology under the discipline known as obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN), which is a surgical field.[2].Prenatal care is important in screening for various complications of pregnancy.[3] This includes routine office visits with physical exams and routine lab tests along with telehealth care for women with low-risk pregnancies:[4].3D ultrasound of 3-inch (76mm) fetus (about 14 weeks gestational age).Fetus at 17 weeks.Fetus at 20 weeks.Routine tests in the first trimester of pregnancy generally include:.Genetic screening for Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), the national standard in the United States, is rapidly evolving away from the AFP-quad screen, done typically in the second trimester at 16\u201318 weeks.[11] The newer integrated screen (formerly called F.A.S.T.E.R for First And Second Trimester Early Results) can be done at 10 plus weeks to 13 plus weeks with an ultrasound of the fetal neck (thicker nuchal skin correlates with higher risk of Down syndrome being present) and two chemicals (analytes), pregnancy-associated plasma protein A and human chorionic gonadotropin (pregnancy hormone level itself[12]).It gives an accurate risk profile very early.A second blood screen at 15 to 20 weeks refines the risk more accurately.[13] The cost is higher than an \"AFP-quad\" screen due to the ultrasound and second blood test, but it is quoted to have a 93% pick up rate as opposed to 88% for the standard AFP/QS.This is an evolving standard of care in the United States.[14][15][16].Most doctors do a sugar load in a drink form of 50 grams of glucose in cola, lime or orange and draw blood an hour later (plus or minus 5 minutes).The standard modified criteria have been lowered to 135 since the late 1980s.[21].", "Wright brothers": "The Wright brothers, Orville Wright (August 19, 1871 \u2013 January 30, 1948) and Wilbur Wright (April 16, 1867 \u2013 May 30, 1912), were American aviation pioneers generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful motor-operated airplane.[3][4][5] They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft with the Wright Flyer on December 17, 1903, four miles (6 km) south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, at what is now known as Kill Devil Hills.The brothers were also the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible..In 1904\u20131905, the Wright brothers developed their flying machine to make longer-running and more aerodynamic flights with the Wright Flyer II, followed by the first truly practical fixed-wing aircraft, the Wright Flyer III.The brothers' breakthrough was their creation of a three-axis control system, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium.[6][7][8][9] This method remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds.[10][11]:\u200a183\u200a From the beginning of their aeronautical work, Wilbur and Orville focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving \"the flying problem\".This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines.[12] Using a small home-built wind tunnel, the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before, enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers.[11]:\u200a156\u200a[13]:\u200a228\u200a Their first U.S.patent did not claim invention of a flying machine, but rather a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine's surfaces.[14].The brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery.Their work with bicycles, in particular, influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.[13]:\u200a169\u200a This was a trend, as many other aviation pioneers were also dedicated cyclists and involved in the bicycle business in various ways.[15] From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, the brothers conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots.Their shop mechanic Charles Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers.[16].The Wright brothers' status as inventors of the airplane has been subject to counter-claims by various parties.Much controversy persists over the many competing claims of early aviators.Edward Roach, historian for the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, argues that they were excellent self-taught engineers who could run a small company, but they did not have the business skills or temperament to dominate the growing aviation industry.[17].", "America's Next Top Model, Cycle 12": "The twelfth cycle of America's Next Top Model

Corporation[a] (commonly shortened to Exxon[4][5][6]) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation and the largest direct descendant of John D.Rockefeller's Standard Oil.The company, which took its present name in 1999 per the merger of Exxon and Mobil, is vertically integrated across the entire oil and gas industry, and within it is also a chemicals division which produces plastic, synthetic rubber, and other chemical products.ExxonMobil is headquartered near the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, though officially incorporated in the U.S.state of New Jersey.[7][8]:\u200a1.ExxonMobil's history traces its earliest roots to 1866 with the formation of the Vacuum Oil Company, itself acquired by Standard Oil in 1879.The company that is today known as ExxonMobil grew out of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (or Jersey Standard for short), the corporate entity which effectively controlled all of Standard Oil prior to its breakup.Jersey Standard grew alongside and with extensive partnership another Standard Oil descendant and its future merger partner, the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), both of which grew bigger by merging with various third companies like Humble Oil (which merged with Jersey Standard) and Vacuum Oil (merged with Socony).Both companies underwent rebranding in the 1960s and early 1970s, and by the time of the 1999 merger, Jersey Standard had been known as Exxon, and Socony known as Mobil.The merger agreement between Exxon and Mobil stipulated that Exxon would buy Mobil and rebrand as ExxonMobil, with Mobil's CEO becoming the vice-chairman of the company.[9].ExxonMobil is one of the world's largest and most powerful companies.ExxonMobil since its merger varied from the first to tenth largest publicly traded company by revenue, and has one of the largest market capitalizations out of any company.[10][11] As of 2023, in the most recent rankings released in the Fortune 500, ExxonMobil was ranked third, and twelfth on the Fortune Global 500.[12] ExxonMobil is the largest investor-owned oil company in the world, the largest oil company headquartered in the Western world, and the largest of the Big Oil companies in both production and market value.[13][14] ExxonMobil's reserves were 20billionBOE at the end of 2016 and the 2007 rates of production were expected to last more than 14 years.[15] With 21 oil refineries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 4.9 million barrels (780,000m3), ExxonMobil is the second largest oil refiner in the world, trailing only Sinopec.[16][17] Approximately 55.56% of the company's shares are held by institutions, the largest of which as of 2019 were The Vanguard Group (8.15%), BlackRock (6.61%), and State Street Corporation

playing company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men.It was destroyed by fire on 29 June 1613.A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and stayed open until the  London theatre closures of 1642.As well as plays by Shakespeare, early works by Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker and John Fletcher were first performed here.[4].A modern reconstruction of the Globe, named \"Shakespeare's Globe\", opened in 1997 approximately 750 feet (230m) from the site of the original theatre.[5].Examination of old leases and parish records has identified the plot of land acquired for building The Globe as extending from the west side of modern-day Southwark Bridge Road eastwards as far as Porter Street and from Park Street southwards as far as the back of Gatehouse Square.[6][7] It was being offered for rent by Thomas Brend, who was a neighbour to John Heminges and Henry Condell,  actors with the Chamberlain's Men.[8].The precise location of the building remained unknown until a small part of the foundations, including one original pier base, was discovered in 1989 by the Department of Greater London Archaeology (now Museum of London Archaeology) beneath the car park at the rear of Anchor Terrace on Park Street.[9] The shape of the foundations is now replicated on the surface.As the majority of the foundations lies beneath 67\u201370 Anchor Terrace, a listed building, no further excavations have been permitted.[10].The Globe was owned by actors who were also shareholders in the Lord Chamberlain's Men.Two of the six Globe shareholders, Richard Burbage and his brother Cuthbert Burbage, owned double shares of the whole, or 25 per cent each; the other four men, Shakespeare, John Heminges, Augustine Phillips, and Thomas Pope, owned a single share, or 12.5 per cent.(Originally William Kempe was intended to be the seventh partner, but he sold out his share to the four minority sharers, leaving them with more than the originally planned 10 per cent).[14] These initial proportions changed over time as new sharers were added.", "It's a Wonderful Life": "It's a Wonderful Life is a 1946 American Christmas supernatural drama film produced and directed by Frank Capra.It is based on the short story and booklet The Greatest Gift self-published by Philip Van Doren Stern in 1943, which itself is loosely based on the 1843 Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol.[4] The film stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a man who has given up his personal dreams in order to help others in his community and whose thoughts of suicide on Christmas Eve bring about the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers).[4] Clarence shows George all the lives he touched and what the world would be like if he did not exist..Theatrically, the film's break-even point was $6.3million, about twice the production cost, a figure it did not come close to achieving on its initial release.Because of the film's disappointing sales, Capra was seen by some studios as having lost his ability to produce popular, financially successful films.[5] Although It's a Wonderful Life initially received mixed reviews and was unsuccessful at the box office, it became a Christmas classic after its copyright lapsed in 1974 and it fell into the public domain, which allowed it to be broadcast without licensing or royalty fees.[6].Today, It's a Wonderful Life is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and among the best Christmas films.[7] It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and has been recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made.[8] It was No.11 on the American Film Institute's 1998 greatest movie list, No.20 on its 2007 greatest movie list, and No.1 on its list of the most inspirational American films of all time.[9] Capra revealed that it was his favorite among the films he directed and that he screened it for his family every Christmas season.It was one of Stewart's favorite films.[10].In 1990, It's a Wonderful Life was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being deemed as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"..On Christmas Eve 1945, in Bedford Falls, New York, George Bailey contemplates suicide.The prayers of his family and friends reach Heaven, where guardian angel second class Clarence Odbody is assigned to save George in order to earn his wings.", "Data warehouse": "In computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system used for reporting and data analysis and is considered a core component of business intelligence.[1] Data warehouses are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources.They store current and historical data in one single place[2] that are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the enterprise.[3] This is beneficial for companies as it enables them to interrogate and draw insights from their data and make decisions.[4].The data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from the operational systems (such as marketing or sales).The data may pass through an operational data store and may require data cleansing[2] for additional operations to ensure data quality before it is used in the data warehouse for reporting..Extract, transform, load (ETL) and extract, load, transform (ELT) are the two main approaches used to build a data warehouse system..The typical extract, transform, load (ETL)-based data warehouse[5] uses staging, data integration, and access layers to house its key functions.The staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems.The integration layer integrates disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer, often storing this transformed data in an operational data store (ODS) database.The integrated data are then moved to yet another database, often called the data warehouse database, where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups, often called dimensions, and into facts and aggregate facts.The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a star schema.The access layer helps users retrieve data.[6].The main source of the data is cleansed, transformed, catalogued, and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for data mining, online analytical processing, market research and decision support.[7] However, the means to retrieve and analyze data, to extract, transform, and load data, and to manage the data dictionary are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system.", "Quarry": "A quarry is a type of open-pit mine in which dimension stone, rock, construction aggregate, riprap, sand, gravel, or slate is excavated from the ground.The operation of quarries is regulated in some jurisdictions to manage their safety risks and reduce their environmental impact.[1][2].The word quarry can also include the underground quarrying for stone, such as Bath stone..Types of rock extracted from quarries include:.Stone quarry is an outdated term for mining construction rocks (limestone, marble, granite, sandstone, etc.).There are open types (called quarries, or open-pit mines) and closed types (mines and caves)..For thousands of years, only hand tools had been used in quarries.In the eighteenth century, the use of drilling and blasting operations was mastered.[3].The term remains used to describe a method of cutting into a certain shape that was used applications, however, such as for glass and tile, as a \"quarry cut\"..The method of removal of stones from their natural bed by using different operations is called quarrying.Methods of quarrying include:.Following steps are used in the blasting process;.", "Mormons": "Mormons are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism, the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement started by Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s.After Smith's death in 1844, the movement split into several groups following different leaders; the majority followed Brigham Young, while smaller groups followed Joseph Smith III, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang.Most of these smaller groups eventually merged into the Community of Christ, and the term Mormon typically refers to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as today, this branch is far larger than all the others combined.People who identify as Mormons may also be independently religious, secular, and non-practicing or belong to other denominations.Since 2018, the LDS Church has emphasized a desire for its members be referred to as \"members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\", or more simply as \"Latter-day Saints\".[9].Mormons have developed a strong sense of community that stems from their doctrine and history.One of the central doctrinal issues that defined Mormonism in the 19th century was the practice of plural marriage, a form of religious polygamy.From 1852 until 1904, when the LDS Church banned the practice, many Mormons who had followed Brigham Young to the Utah Territory openly practiced polygamy.Mormons dedicate significant time and resources to serving in their churches.A prominent practice among young and retired members of the LDS Church is to serve a full-time proselytizing mission.Mormons have a health code that eschews alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea, coffee, and addictive substances.They tend to be very family-oriented and have strong connections across generations and with extended family, reflecting their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death.", "Asset": "In financial accounting, an asset is any resource owned or controlled by a business or an economic entity.It is anything (tangible or intangible) that can be used to produce positive economic value.Assets represent value of ownership that can be converted into cash (although cash itself is also considered an asset).[1].The balance sheet of a firm records the monetary[2] value of the assets owned by that firm.It covers money and other valuables belonging to an individual or to a business.[1].Assets can be grouped into two major classes: tangible assets and intangible assets.Tangible assets contain various subclasses, including current assets and fixed assets.[3] Current assets include cash, inventory, accounts receivable, while fixed assets include land, buildings and equipment.[4].Intangible assets are non-physical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm an advantage in the marketplace.Intangible assets include goodwill, intellectual property (such as copyrights, trademarks, patents, computer programs),[4] and financial assets, including financial investments, bonds, and companies' shares..IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), the most widely used financial reporting system, defines: \"An asset is a present economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events.[5].An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits.\"[6].The definition under US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles used in the United States of America): \"An asset is a present right of an entity to an economic benefit.\"[7].", "Neuron": "Within a nervous system, a neuron, neurone, or nerve cell is an electrically excitable cell that fires electric signals called action potentials across a neural network.Neurons communicate with other cells via synapses - specialized connections that commonly use minute amounts of chemical neurotransmitters to pass the electric signal from the presynaptic neuron to the target cell through the synaptic gap.The neuron is the main component of nervous tissue in all animals except sponges and placozoa.Non-animals like plants and fungi do not have nerve cells.The ability to generate electric signals first appeared in evolution 700 million years ago.800 million years ago, predecessors of neurons were the peptidergic secretory cells.They eventually gained new gene modules which enabled cells to create post-synaptic scaffolds and ion channels that generate fast electrical signals.The ability to generate electric signals was a key innovation in the evolution of the nervous system.[1].Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their function.Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch, sound, or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs, and they send signals to the spinal cord or brain.Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions[2] to glandular output.Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord.", "Super Bowl XLIII": "Super Bowl XLIII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champions Pittsburgh Steelers and the National Football Conference (NFC) champions Arizona Cardinals to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2008 season.The Steelers defeated the Cardinals by the score of 27\u201323.The game was played on February 1, 2009,[8] at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida..With this victory, the Steelers became the first team to win six Super Bowl championships.The win was also Pittsburgh's second Super Bowl victory in four years, after winning Super Bowl XL at the end of the 2005 season.The Cardinals entered the game seeking their first NFL title since 1947, the longest championship drought in the league.The club became an unexpected winner during the regular season, compiling a 9\u20137 record, and earning a spot in the playoffs with the aid of head coach Ken Whisenhunt, who was the Steelers' offensive coordinator in Super Bowl XL, and the re-emergence of quarterback Kurt Warner, who was the Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl XXXIV with his former team, the St.Louis Rams..Pittsburgh jumped to a 17\u20137 halftime lead, aided by linebacker James Harrison's Super Bowl-record 100-yard interception return for a touchdown.Trailing 20\u20137 at the start of the fourth quarter, Arizona scored 16 consecutive points, including a safety by Pittsburgh that led to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald's 64-yard touchdown reception, to take their first lead of the game with 2:37 remaining.But the Steelers marched 78 yards to score on wide receiver Santonio Holmes' 6-yard game-winning touchdown catch with 35 seconds left.Holmes, who caught nine passes for 131 yards and a touchdown, including four receptions for 73 yards on that final game-winning drive, was named Super Bowl MVP.", "Bryophyte": "Bryophytes (/\u02c8bra\u026a\u02cco\u028afa\u026ats/) are a group of land plants, sometimes treated as a taxonomic division, that contains three groups of non-vascular land plants (embryophytes): the liverworts, hornworts and mosses.[1] In the strict sense, Bryophyta consists of the mosses only.Bryophytes are characteristically limited in size and prefer moist habitats although they can survive in drier environments.[2] The bryophytes consist of about 20,000 plant species.[3][4] Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures (gametangia and sporangia), but they do not produce flowers or seeds.They reproduce sexually by spores and asexually by fragmentation or the production of gemmae.[5] Though bryophytes were considered a paraphyletic group in recent years, almost all of the most recent phylogenetic evidence supports the monophyly of this group, as originally classified by Wilhelm Schimper in 1879.[6] The term bryophyte comes from Ancient Greek  \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03bf\u03bd (br\u00faon)'tree moss, liverwort', and  \u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd (phut\u00f3n)'plant'..The defining features of bryophytes are:.Bryophytes exist in a wide variety of habitats.They can be found growing in a range of temperatures (cold arctics and in hot deserts), elevations (sea-level to alpine), and moisture (dry deserts to wet rain forests).Bryophytes can grow where vascularized plants cannot because they do not depend on roots for uptake of nutrients from soil.Bryophytes can survive on rocks and bare soil.[8].Like all land plants (embryophytes), bryophytes have life cycles with alternation of generations.[9] In each cycle, a haploid gametophyte, each of whose cells contains a fixed number of unpaired chromosomes, alternates with a diploid sporophyte, whose cells contain two sets of paired chromosomes.Gametophytes produce haploid sperm and eggs which fuse to form diploid zygotes that grow into sporophytes.Sporophytes produce haploid spores by meiosis, that grow into gametophytes..Bryophytes are gametophyte dominant,[10] meaning that the more prominent, longer-lived plant is the haploid gametophyte.", "Bank": "A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans.[1] Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.[2].Whereas banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks.Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional-reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities.In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords..Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world.In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties\u2013  notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds\u2013  have played a central role over many centuries.The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472), while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590)..Banking as an archaic activity (or quasi-banking[3][4]) is thought to have begun as early as the end of the 4th millennium BCE,[5] to the 3rd millennia BCE.[6][7].The present era of banking can be traced to medieval and early Renaissance Italy, to the rich cities in the centre and north like Florence, Lucca, Siena, Venice and Genoa.The Bardi and Peruzzi families dominated banking in 14th-century Florence, establishing branches in many other parts of Europe.[8] Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici set up one of the most famous Italian banks, the Medici Bank, in 1397.[9] The Republic of Genoa founded the earliest-known state deposit bank, and Banco di San Giorgio (Bank of St.George), in 1407 at Genoa, Italy.[10].Fractional reserve banking and the issue of banknotes emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries.", "Xbox": "Xbox is a video gaming brand that consists of five home video game consoles, as well as applications (games), streaming service Xbox Cloud Gaming, and online services such as the Xbox network and Xbox Game Pass.The brand is produced by Microsoft Gaming, a division of Microsoft..The brand was first introduced in first introduced in the United States in November 2001, with the launch of the original Xbox console.The Xbox branding was formerly, from 2012 to 2015, used as Microsoft's digital media entertainment brand replacing Zune.[1][2] In 2022, Microsoft expanded its gaming business and reorganized Xbox to become part of it's newly formed Microsoft Gaming division.Under Microsoft Gaming, Xbox's first-party publishers are Xbox Game Studios, ZeniMax Media (Bethesda Softworks), and Activision Blizzard (Activision, Blizzard Entertainment, and King), who own numerous studios and successful franchises..The original device was the first video game console offered by an American company after the Atari Jaguar stopped sales in 1996.It reached over 24million units sold by May 2006.[3] Microsoft's second console, the Xbox 360, was released in 2005 and has sold 86million units as of October 2021.The third console, the Xbox One, was released in November 2013 and has sold 58 million units.[4] The fourth line of Xbox consoles, the Xbox Series X and Series S, were released in November 2020.The head of Xbox is Phil Spencer, who succeeded former head Marc Whitten in late March 2014.[5][6].When Sony Computer Entertainment first announced the PlayStation 2 in 1999, the company had positioned the console as a centerpiece for home entertainment, as it not only would play video games, but also could play audio CDs and video DVDs.Microsoft, whose business had been primarily in supporting the personal computer (PC) business with its Windows operating system, software, and games, saw the PlayStation 2 as a threat to the personal computer.[7].Four engineers from Microsoft's DirectX team\u2014Kevin Bachus, Seamus Blackley, Ted Hase and DirectX team leader Otto Berkes, began to envision what a Microsoft console to compete against the PlayStation 2 would be like.", "Gospel of john": "The Gospel of John[a] (Ancient Greek: \u0395\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f38\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd, romanized:Euang\u00e9lion kat\u00e0 I\u014d\u00e1nn\u0113n) is the fourth of the four canonical gospels.It contains a highly schematic account of the ministry of Jesus, with seven \"signs\" culminating in the raising of Lazarus (foreshadowing the resurrection of Jesus) and seven \"I am\" discourses (concerned with issues of the church\u2013synagogue debate at the time of composition)[3] culminating in Thomas' proclamation of the risen Jesus as \"my Lord and my God\".[4] The gospel's concluding verses set out its purpose, \"that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.\"[5][6].John reached its final form around AD 90\u2013110,[7] although it contains signs of origins dating back to AD 70 and possibly even earlier.[8]  Like the three other gospels, it is anonymous, although it identifies an unnamed \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" as the source of its traditions.[9][10] It most likely arose within a \"Johannine community\",[11][12] and \u2013 as it is closely related in style and content to the three Johannine epistles \u2013 most scholars treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not from the same author.[13].The Gospel of John, like all the gospels, is anonymous.[14] John 21:22[15] references a disciple whom Jesus loved and John 21:24\u201325[16] says: \"This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true...\"[11] Early Christian tradition, first found in Irenaeus (c.\u2009130\u2013 c.\u2009202 AD), identified this disciple with John the Apostle, but most scholars have abandoned this hypothesis or hold it only tenuously[17] \u2013 there are multiple reasons for this conclusion, including, for example, the fact that the gospel is written in good Greek and displays sophisticated theology, and is therefore unlikely to have been the work of a simple fisherman.[18] These verses imply rather that the core of the gospel relies on the testimony (perhaps written) of the \"disciple who is testifying\", as collected, preserved and reshaped by a community of followers (the \"we\" of the passage), and that a single follower (the \"I\") rearranged this material and perhaps added the final chapter and other passages to produce the final gospel.[11] Most scholars estimate the final form of the text to be around AD 90\u2013110.[7] Given its complex history there may have been more than one place of composition, and while the author was familiar with Jewish customs and traditions, his frequent clarification of these implies that he wrote for a mixed Jewish/Gentile or Jewish context outside Palestine.[citation needed].The author may have drawn on a \"signs source\" (a collection of miracles) for chapters 1\u201312, a \"passion source\" for the story of Jesus's arrest and crucifixion, and a \"sayings source\" for the discourses, but these hypotheses are much debated.[19] He seems to have known some version of Mark and Luke, as he shares with them some items of vocabulary and clusters of incidents arranged in the same order,[20][21] but key terms from those gospels are absent or nearly so, implying that if he did know them he felt free to write independently.[21] The Hebrew scriptures were an important source,[22] with 14 direct quotations (versus 27 in Mark, 54 in Matthew, 24 in Luke), and their influence is vastly increased when allusions and echoes are included,[23] but the majority of John's direct quotations do not agree exactly with any known version of the Jewish scriptures.[24] Recent arguments by Richard Bauckham and others that the Gospel of John preserves eyewitness testimony have not won general acceptance.[25][26].For much of the 20th century, scholars interpreted the Gospel of John within the paradigm of a hypothetical \"Johannine community\",[27] meaning that the gospel sprang from a late-1st-century Christian community excommunicated from the Jewish synagogue (probably meaning the Jewish community)[28] on account of its belief in Jesus as the promised Jewish messiah.[29] This interpretation, which saw the community as essentially sectarian and standing outside the mainstream of early Christianity, has been increasingly challenged in the first decades of the 21st century,[30] and there is currently considerable debate over the social, religious and historical context of the gospel.[31] Nevertheless, the Johannine literature as a whole (made up of the gospel, the three Johannine epistles, and Revelation), points to a community holding itself distinct from the Jewish culture from which it arose while cultivating an intense devotion to Jesus as the definitive revelation of a God with whom they were in close contact through the Paraclete.[32].The majority of scholars see four sections in the Gospel of John: a prologue (1:1\u201318); an account of the ministry, often called the \"Book of Signs\" (1:19\u201312:50); the account of Jesus' final night with his disciples and the passion and resurrection, sometimes called the Book of Glory[33] or Book of Exaltation  (13:1\u201320:31);[34] and a conclusion (20:30\u201331); to these is added an epilogue which most scholars believe did not form part of the original text (Chapter 21).[33] Disagreement does exist; some scholars such as Richard Bauckham argue that John 21 was part of the original work, for example.[35].The structure is highly schematic: there are seven \"signs\" culminating in the raising of Lazarus (foreshadowing the resurrection of Jesus), and seven \"I am\" sayings and discourses, culminating in Thomas's proclamation of the risen Jesus as \"my Lord and my God\" (the same title, dominus et deus, claimed by the Emperor Domitian, an indication of the date of composition).[4].Scholars agree that while John clearly regards Jesus as divine, he just as clearly subordinates him to the one God.[41] According to James Dunn, this Christology view in John, does not describe a subordinationist relation, but rather the authority and validity of the Son's\"revelation\"of the Father, the continuity between the Father and the Son.Dunn sees this view as intended to serve the Logos Christology,[42] while others (e.g.,Andrew Loke) see it as connected to the incarnation theme in John.[43] The idea of the Trinity developed only slowly through the merger of Hebrew monotheism and the idea of the messiah, Greek ideas of the relationship between God, the world, and the mediating Saviour, and the Egyptian concept of the three-part divinity.[44] However, while the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament possesses a triadic understanding of God[45] and contains a number of Trinitarian formulas.[46][47] John's \"high Christology\" depicts Jesus as divine and pre-existent, defends him against Jewish claims that he was \"making himself equal to God\",[48][49] and talks openly about his divine role and echoing Yahweh's \"I Am that I Am\" with seven \"I Am\" declarations of his own.[50][b].In the prologue, the gospel identifies Jesus as the Logos or Word.In Ancient Greek philosophy, the term logos meant the principle of cosmic reason.[58] In this sense, it was similar to the Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation.[59] The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world.", "Plagues of Egypt": "The Plagues of Egypt, in the account of the book of Exodus, are ten disasters inflicted on Biblical Egypt by the God of Israel in order to convince the Pharaoh to emancipate the enslaved Israelites, each of them confronting Pharaoh and one of his Egyptian gods;[1] they serve as \"signs and marvels\" given by God to answer Pharaoh's taunt that he does not know Yahweh: \"The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD\".[2]:\u200a117.The story is also mentioned in surah 7( Al-A'raf) of the Quran[3], where a similar version of events takes place after the Fir'awn (Pharoah) rejects Moses' signs..This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD: With the staff that is in my hands I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink and the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water..This is what the great LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.If you refuse to let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs.The Nile will teem with frogs.They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs.The frogs will go up on you and your people and all your officials..The Bible says that God ordered frogs to emerge from the Nile, which then jumped around virtually everywhere in Egypt.The magicians attempted to produce frogs from their secret arts, conjuring up a second wave of frogs.Even the private quarters of Pharaoh was infested with frogs.", "Role-playing game": "A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game,[1][2] RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting.Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development.[3] Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.[4].There are several forms of role-playing games.The original form, sometimes called the tabletop role-playing game (TRPG or TTRPG), is conducted through discussion, whereas in live action role-playing (LARP), players physically perform their characters' actions.[5] In both of these forms, an arranger called a game master (GM) usually decides on the rules and setting to be used, while acting as the referee; each of the other players takes on the role of a single character.[6].Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media, such as multiplayer text-based Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) and their graphics-based successors, massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs).Role-playing games also include single-player role-playing video games in which players control a character, or team of characters, who undertake(s) quests and may include player capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics.These electronic games sometimes share settings and rules with tabletop RPGs, but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling.[7][8].This type of game is well-established, so some RPG-related game forms, such as trading/collectible card games (CCGs) and wargames, may not be included under the definition.Some amount of role-playing activity may be present in such games, but it is not the primary focus.[9] The term role-playing game is also sometimes used to describe games involving roleplay simulation and exercises used in teaching, training, and academic research..Both authors and major publishers of tabletop role-playing games consider them to be a form of interactive and collaborative storytelling.[2][10][11] Events, characters, and narrative structure give a sense of a narrative experience, and the game need not have a strongly-defined storyline.[12] Interactivity is the crucial difference between role-playing games and traditional fiction.Whereas a viewer of a television show is a passive observer, a player in a role-playing game makes choices that affect the story.[13] Such role-playing games extend an older tradition of storytelling games where a small party of friends collaborate to create a story..While simple forms of role-playing exist in traditional children's games of make believe, role-playing games add a level of sophistication and persistence to this basic idea with additions such as game facilitators and rules of interaction.", "World's busiest airport": "The definition of world's busiest airport has been specified by the Airports Council International in Montreal, Canada.[1] The ACI

petroleum industry and estimated to be 8 to 31 percent larger in volume than the previous largest, the Ixtoc I oil spill, also in the Gulf of Mexico.The United States federal government estimated the

that the well site was still leaking.[11][12] The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is regarded as one of the largest environmental disasters in world history..A massive response ensued to protect beaches, wetlands and estuaries from the spreading oil utilizing skimmer ships, floating booms, controlled burns and 1,840,000USgal (7,000m3) of oil dispersant.[13] Due to the months-long spill, along with adverse effects from the response and cleanup activities, extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats and fishing and tourism industries was reported.[14]   In Louisiana, oil cleanup crews worked four days a week on 55mi (89km) of Louisiana shoreline throughout 2013.4,900,000lb (2,200t) of oily material was removed from the beaches in 2013, over double the amount collected in 2012.[15] Oil continued to be found as far from the Macondo site as the waters off the Florida Panhandle and Tampa Bay, where scientists said the oil and dispersant mixture is embedded in the sand.[16]  In April 2013, it was reported that dolphins and other marine life continued to die in record numbers with infant dolphins dying at six times the normal rate.[17]  One study released in 2014 reported that tuna and amberjack that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs that would be expected to be fatal or at least life-shortening and another study found that cardiotoxicity might have been widespread in animal life exposed to the spill.[18][19].Numerous investigations explored the causes of the explosion and record-setting spill.The United States Government report, published in September 2011, pointed to defective cement on the well, faulting mostly BP, but also rig operator Transocean and contractor Halliburton.[20][21] Earlier in 2011, a White House commission likewise blamed BP and its partners for a series of cost cutting decisions and an inadequate safety system, but also concluded that the spill resulted from \"systemic\" root causes and \"absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies, might well recur\".[22].In November 2012, BP and the United States Department of Justice settled federal criminal charges, with BP pleading guilty to 11 counts of manslaughter, two misdemeanors, and a felony count of lying to the United States Congress.BP also agreed to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics, and the Environmental Protection Agency announced that BP would be temporarily banned from new contracts with the United States government.BP and the Department of Justice agreed to a record-setting $4.525billion in fines and other payments.[23][24][25]  As of 2018[update], cleanup costs, charges and penalties had cost the company more than $65billion.[26][27].In September 2014, a United States District Court judge ruled that BP was primarily responsible for the oil spill because of its gross negligence and reckless conduct.[28] In April 2016, BP agreed to pay $20.8billion in fines, the largest environmental damage settlement in United States history.[29].Deepwater Horizon was a 10-year-old[30] semi-submersible, mobile, floating, dynamically positioned drilling rig that could operate in waters up to 10,000ft (3,000m) deep.[31] Built by South Korean company Hyundai Heavy Industries[32] and owned by Transocean, the rig operated under the Marshallese flag of convenience, and was chartered to BP from March 2008 to September 2013.[2] It was drilling a deep exploratory well, 18,360ft (5,600m) below sea level, in approximately 5,100ft (1,600m) of water.The well is situated in the Macondo Prospect in Mississippi Canyon Block 253 (MC253) of the Gulf of Mexico, in the United States' exclusive economic zone.", "Where the Streets Have No Name": "\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" is a song by Irish rock band U2.It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was released as the album's third single in August 1987.The song's hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effect, played during the song's introduction and again at the end.Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person's religion and income based on the street on which they lived, particularly in Belfast.During the band's difficulties recording the song, producer Brian Eno considered erasing the song's tapes to have them start from scratch..\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was praised by critics and became a commercial success, peaking at number thirteen in the US, number fourteen in Canada, number ten in the Netherlands, and number four in the United Kingdom.The song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on The Joshua Tree Tour.The song was performed on a Los Angeles rooftop for the filming of its music video, which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video..The music for \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" originated from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions.In an upstairs room at Melbeach House\u2014his newly purchased home\u2014he used a four-track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards, bass, guitar, and a drum machine.Realising that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs, he wanted to \"conjure up the ultimate U2 live-song\", so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future U2 show if he were a fan.[2] After finishing the rough mix, he felt he had come up with \"the most amazing guitar part and song of [his] life\".With no one in the house to share the demo with, he recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration.[2].", "Tom Hanks": "Thomas Jeffrey Hanks (born July 9, 1956) is an American actor and filmmaker.Known for both his comedic and dramatic roles, he is one of the most popular and recognizable film stars worldwide, and is regarded as an American cultural icon.[2] Hanks' films have grossed more than $4.9billion in North America and more than $9.96billion worldwide,[3] making him the fourth-highest-grossing actor in North America.[4] He has received numerous honors including the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2002, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2014, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the French Legion of Honor both in 2016,[5][6] as well as the Golden Globe Cecil B.DeMille Award in 2020.[7].Hanks made his breakthrough with leading roles in a series of comedy films which received positive media attention,

series, first shown on NBC during the 2010\u20132011 television season as a mid-season replacement.[1] A two-hour pilot episode aired on Sunday, January 9, 2011 at 9pm Eastern and Pacific Time, and was repeated the next day.Further episodes aired on Monday evenings at 9pm from January 17.[2] NBC reduced the number of episodes ordered from 13 to 10 due to low ratings.[3].On March 2, 2011, NBC canceled the series after one season.It was also announced that the series finale would be shown only on the network's website.[4].The series, set in fictional Palm City, California, follows Vince Faraday, an honest detective who decides to leave the police force after he witnesses the murder of a new police chief by a mysterious villain known as Chess.Faraday accepts an offer to work for ARK, a private security firm owned and operated by billionaire entrepreneur Peter Fleming.ARK is petitioning Palm City to privatize the police and public safety operations..A video streamed to Faraday from an investigative blogger known only as Orwell leads him and partner, Marty Voyt, to a cargo train owned by Fleming's firm.They discover the train is smuggling implosive weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) inside children's toys.Voyt is corrupt and delivers Faraday to Chess, who reveals himself as Fleming.Fleming frames Faraday for the police chief's murder.In a news event staged by Fleming, Faraday is \"revealed\" as Chess as an ARK security team chases him along the city waterfront.", "Halley's Comet": "Halley's Comet, Comet Halley, or sometimes simply Halley, officially designated 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet visible from Earth every 75\u201379 years.[1] Halley is the only known short-period comet that is regularly visible to the naked eye from Earth, and thus the only naked-eye comet that can appear twice in a human lifetime.[15] It last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061..Halley's periodic returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers around the world since at least 240 BC.But it was not until 1705 that the English astronomer Edmond Halley understood that these appearances were re-appearances of the same comet.As a result of this discovery, the comet is named after Edmond Halley.[16].During its 1986 visit to the inner Solar System, Halley's Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation.[17][18] These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's \"dirty snowball\" model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices\u2014such as water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and dust.The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy..Comet Halley is commonly pronounced /\u02c8h\u00e6li/, rhyming with valley, or /\u02c8he\u026ali/, rhyming with daily.[19][20] Colin Ronan, one of Edmond Halley's biographers, preferred /\u02c8h\u0254\u02d0li/, rhyming with crawly.[21] Spellings of Halley's name during his lifetime included Hailey, Haley, Hayley, Halley, Hawley, and Hawly, so its contemporary pronunciation is uncertain, but the version rhyming with valley seems to be preferred by current bearers of the surname.[22].Halley was the first comet to be recognized as periodic.Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere.This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon.Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.[23].In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in which he outlined his laws of gravity and motion.", "List of United States cities by population": "Download coordinates as:.This is a list of the most populous incorporated places of the United States.As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place includes cities, towns, villages, boroughs, and municipalities.[a] A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.[b] Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent.Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places.This list presents only the portion of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place..This list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits; the populations of other municipalities considered suburbs of a central city are listed separately, and unincorporated areas within urban agglomerations are not included.Therefore, a different ranking is evident when considering U.S.urban areas or metropolitan areas..This table lists the 333 incorporated places in the United States, excluding the U.S.territories, with a population of at least 100,000 as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the U.S.Census Bureau.Five states have no cities with populations exceeding 100,000.", "Mayflower": "Mayflower was an English ship that transported a group of English families, known today as the Pilgrims, from England to the New World in 1620.After 10 weeks at sea, Mayflower, with 102 passengers and a crew of about 30, reached what is today the United States, dropping anchor near the tip of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on November 21[O.S.November 11], 1620..Differing from their contemporaries, the Puritans (who sought to reform and purify the Church of England), the Pilgrims chose to separate themselves from the Church of England, which forced them to pray in private.They believed it was beyond redemption due to its resistance to reform and Roman Catholic past.Starting in 1608, a group of English families left England for the Netherlands, where they could worship freely.By 1620, the community determined to cross the Atlantic for America, which they considered a \"new Promised Land\", where they would establish Plymouth Colony.[1]:\u200a44.The Pilgrims had originally hoped to reach America by early October using two ships, but delays and complications meant they could use only one, Mayflower.Arriving in November, they had to survive unprepared through a harsh winter.As a result, only half of the original Pilgrims survived the first winter at Plymouth.If not for the help of local indigenous peoples to teach them food gathering and other survival skills, all of the colonists might have perished.The following year, those 53 who survived[2] celebrated the colony's first fall harvest along with 90 Wampanoag Native American people,[3] an occasion declared in centuries later the first American Thanksgiving.[4] Before disembarking the Mayflower, the Pilgrims wrote and signed the Mayflower Compact, an agreement that established a rudimentary government, in which each member would contribute to the safety and welfare of the planned settlement.", "Forward (association football)": "Forwards (also known as attackers) are outfield positions in an association football team who play the furthest up the pitch and are therefore most responsible for scoring goals as well as assisting them.As with any attacking player, the role of the forward relies heavily on being able to create space for attack.[1] Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players..Attacking positions generally favour irrational players who ask questions to the defensive side of the opponent in order to create scoring chances, where they benefit from a lack of predictability in attacking play.Modern team formations normally include one to three forwards.For example, the common 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 includes one forward.[2] Less conventional formations may include more than three forwards, or sometimes none.[3][4].The traditional role of a centre-forward is to score the majority of goals on behalf of the team.If they are tall and physical players, with good heading ability, the player may also be used to get onto the end of crosses, win long balls, or receive passes and retain possession of the ball with their back to goal as teammates advance, in order to provide depth for their team or help teammates score by providing a pass ('through ball' into the box), the latter variation usually requiring quicker pace and good movement, in addition to finishing ability.Most modern centre-forwards operate in front of the second strikers or central attacking midfielders, and do the majority of the ball handling outside the box.The present role of a centre-forward is sometimes interchangeable with that of an attacking midfielder or second striker, however, especially in the 4\u20133\u20131\u20132 or 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132 formations.The term centre-forward is taken from the earlier football playing formations, such as the 2\u20133\u20135, in which there were five forward players: two outside forwards, two inside forwards, and one centre-forward.The term \"target forward\" is often used interchangeably with that of a centre-forward, but usually describes a particular type of striker, who is usually a tall and physically strong player, who is adept at heading the ball; their main role is to win high balls in the air, hold up the ball, and create chances for other members of the team, in addition to possibly scoring many goals themselves.However, the two terms are not necessarily synonymous, with the target forward having developed into a more specialised role, while the centre-forward description is more broad, encompassing many types of forwards.[6].", "Domestic partnership in California": "A California domestic partnership is a legal relationship, analogous to marriage, created in 1999 to extend the rights and benefits of marriage to same-sex couples (and opposite-sex couples where both parties were over 62).It was extended to all opposite-sex couples as of January 1, 2016 and by January 1, 2020 to include new votes that updated SB-30 with more benefits and rights to California couples choosing domestic partnership before their wedding.California Governor Newsom signed into law on July 30, 2019.[1].Domestic partnerships legally afford couples who choose not to marry \"the same rights, protections, and benefits, and...the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law...\" as married spouses.[2].Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the United States created by a legislature without court intervention.Initially, domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privileges\u2014principally just hospital-visitation rights and the right to be claimed as a next of kin of the estate of a deceased partner.The legislature has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to include all of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage.As such, California domestic partnerships are functionally equivalent to civil unions offered in several other states..Filing an invalid California Declaration of Domestic Partnership is a serious offense and considered a misdemeanor..Although the program enjoys broad support in California,[3] it has been the source of some controversy.Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court.", "Mark Jackson (basketball)": "Mark A.Jackson (born April 1, 1965) is an American former professional basketball player who was a point guard in the National Basketball Association (NBA).He played college basketball for the St.John's Red Storm and was selected by the New York Knicks in the first round of the 1987 NBA draft with the 18th overall pick.He played in the NBA for the Knicks, Los Angeles Clippers, Indiana Pacers, Denver Nuggets, Toronto Raptors, Utah Jazz, and Houston Rockets in a career spanning from 1987 to 2004..After retiring from playing basketball, Jackson became a broadcast commentator for ESPN and ABC alongside his former coach Jeff Van Gundy and play-by-play man Mike Breen.He also worked as an analyst for The YES Network's New Jersey Nets games.In 2011 the Golden State Warriors hired Jackson as head coach.He coached the team for three seasons, but was fired in 2014 despite leading the Warriors to consecutive playoff appearances for the first time in over 20 years.Following this, he returned to ESPN and continued working as a commentator until his removal in 2023..Mark Jackson grew up in the St.Albans neighborhood of Queens, New York.", "Languages of South Africa": "At least thirty-five languages indigenous to South Africa are spoken in the Republic, twelve of which are official languages of South Africa: Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho, Swazi, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa, Zulu, Afrikaans, and English, which is the primary language used in parliamentary and state discourse, though all official languages are equal in legal status.In addition, South African Sign Language was recognised as the twelfth official language of South Africa by the National Assembly on 3 May 2023.[2] Unofficial languages are protected under the Constitution of South Africa, though few are mentioned by any name..Unofficial and marginalised languages include what are considered some of Southern Africa's oldest[according to whom?] languages: Khoekhoegowab, !Orakobab, Xirikobab, N|uuki, !Xunthali, and Khwedam; and other African languages, such as SiPhuthi, IsiHlubi, SiBhaca, SiLala, SiNhlangwini (IsiZansi), SiNrebele (SiSumayela), IsiMpondo/IsiMpondro, IsiMpondomise/IsiMpromse/Isimpomse, KheLobedu, SePulana, HiPai, SeKutswe, Se\u1e70okwa, SeHananwa, SiThonga, SiLaNgomane, SheKgalagari, XiRhonga, SeKopa (Sekgaga), and others.Most South Africans can speak more than one language,[3] and there is very often a diglossia between the official and unofficial language forms for speakers of the latter..The most common language spoken as a first language by South Africans is Zulu (23 percent), followed by Xhosa (16 percent), and Afrikaans (14 percent).English is the fourth most common first language in the country (9.6%), but is understood in most urban areas and is the dominant language in government and the media.[4].The majority of South Africans speak a language from one of the two principal branches of the Bantu languages that are represented in South Africa: the Sotho\u2013Tswana branch (which includes Southern Sotho, Northern Sotho and Tswana languages officially), or the Nguni branch (which includes Zulu, Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele languages officially).For each of the two groups, the languages within that group are for the most part intelligible to a native speaker of any other language within that group.[5].The indigenous African languages of South Africa which are official, and therefore dominant, can be divided into two geographical zones, with Nguni languages being predominant in the south-eastern third of the country (Indian Ocean coast) and Sotho-Tswana languages being predominant in the northern third of the country located further inland, as also in Botswana and Lesotho.Gauteng is the most linguistically heterogeneous province, with roughly equal numbers of Nguni, Sotho-Tswana and Indo-European language speakers, with Khoekhoe influence.This has resulted in the spread of an urban argot, Tsotsitaal or S'Camtho/Ringas, in large urban townships in the province, which has spread nationwide..Tsotsitaal in its original form as \"Flaaitaal\" was based on Afrikaans, a language derived from Dutch, which is the most widely spoken language in the western half of the country (Western and Northern Cape).", "Aluminium nitrate": "Aluminium nitrate is a white, water-soluble salt of aluminium and nitric acid, most commonly existing as the crystalline hydrate, aluminium nitrate nonahydrate, Al(NO3)3\u00b79H2O..Aluminium nitrate cannot be synthesized by the reaction of aluminium with concentrated nitric acid, as the aluminium forms a passivation layer..Aluminium nitrate may instead be prepared by the reaction of nitric acid with aluminium(III) chloride.Nitrosyl chloride is produced as a by-product; it bubbles out of the solution as a gas.More conveniently, the salt can be made by reacting nitric acid with aluminium hydroxide..Aluminium nitrate may also be prepared a metathesis reaction between aluminium sulfate and a nitrate salt with a suitable cation such as barium, strontium, calcium, silver, or lead.e.g.Al2(SO4)3 + 3Ba(NO3)2 \u2192 2Al(NO3)3 + 3BaSO4..Aluminium nitrate is a strong oxidizing agent.It is used in tanning leather, antiperspirants, corrosion inhibitors, extraction of uranium, petroleum refining, and as a nitrating agent..The nonahydrate and other hydrated aluminium nitrates have many applications.These salts are used to produce alumina for preparation of insulating papers, in cathode ray tube heating elements, and on transformer core laminates.", "New York Jets": "American Football League (1960\u20131969).National Football League (1970\u2013present).The New York Jets are a professional American football team based in the New York metropolitan area.The Jets compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division.The Jets play their home games at MetLife Stadium (which they share with the New York Giants) in East Rutherford, New Jersey, 5 miles (8.0km) west of New York City.The team is headquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey.The franchise is legally organized as a limited liability company under the name New York Jets, LLC.[6].The team was founded in 1959 as the Titans of New York, an original member of the American Football League (AFL); later, the franchise joined the NFL in the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970.The team began play in 1960 at the Polo Grounds.Under new ownership, the current name was adopted in 1963 and the franchise moved to Shea Stadium in 1964 and then to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in 1984.The Jets advanced to the playoffs for the first time in 1968 and went on to compete in Super Bowl III where they defeated the Baltimore Colts, becoming the first AFL team to defeat an NFL club in an AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game.[7] Since 1968 the Jets have won the AFC Eastern Division twice, in 1998 and 2002; appeared in the playoffs 13 times, and in the AFC Championship Game four times, most recently losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2010.[8] However, the Jets have never returned to the Super Bowl, making them one of two NFL teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance along with the New Orleans Saints, and one of five teams (along with the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars and Houston Texans) to never win a conference championship since the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970.As of 2023 the Jets have not made a playoff appearance since 2010, which is the longest active playoff appearance drought among current NFL franchises, and have not hosted a playoff game since 2002..", "Psilocybin mushroom": "Psilocybin mushrooms, commonly known as magic mushrooms, are a polyphyletic informal group of fungi that contain psilocybin, which turns into psilocin upon ingestion.Biological genera containing psilocybin mushrooms include Psilocybe, Panaeolus (including Copelandia), Inocybe, Pluteus, Gymnopilus, and Pholiotina..Amongst other cultural applications, psilocybin mushrooms are used as recreational drugs.They may be depicted in Stone Age rock art in Africa and Europe, but are more certainly represented in pre-Columbian sculptures and glyphs seen throughout the Americas..Psilocybin mushrooms have been[when?] and continue to be used in indigenous South American cultures in religious, divinatory, or spiritual contexts.[1][failed verification].Rock art from c.\u20099000\u20137000 BCE from Tassili, Algeria, is believed to depict psychedelic mushrooms and the transformation of the user under their influence.[2] Prehistoric rock art near Villar del Humo in Spain suggests that Psilocybe hispanica was used in religious rituals 6,000 years ago.[3] The hallucinogenic[4] species of the Psilocybe genus have a history of use among the native peoples of Mesoamerica for religious communion, divination, and healing, from pre-Columbian times to the present day.[5] Mushroom stones and motifs have been found in Guatemala.[6] A statuette dating from c.\u2009200 CE depicting a mushroom strongly resembling Psilocybe mexicana was found in the west Mexican state of Colima in a shaft and chamber tomb.A Psilocybe species known to the Aztecs as te\u014dnan\u0101catl (literally \"divine mushroom\": the agglutinative form of te\u014dtl (god, sacred) and nan\u0101catl (mushroom) in Nahuatl language) was reportedly served at the coronation of the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II in 1502.Aztecs and Mazatecs referred to psilocybin mushrooms as genius mushrooms, divinatory mushrooms, and wondrous mushrooms when translated into English.[7] Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan reported the ritualistic use of teonan\u00e1catl by the Aztecs when he traveled to Central America after the expedition of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.[8].After the Spanish conquest, Catholic missionaries campaigned against the cultural tradition of the Aztecs, dismissing the Aztecs as idolaters, and the use of hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms, together with other pre-Christian traditions, was quickly suppressed.[6] The Spanish believed the mushroom allowed the Aztecs and others to communicate with demons.Despite this history, the use of teonan\u00e1catl has persisted in some remote areas.[1].The first mention of hallucinogenic mushrooms in European medicinal literature was in the London Medical and Physical Journal in 1799: A man served Psilocybe semilanceata mushrooms he had picked for breakfast in London's Green Park to his family.The apothecary who treated them later described how the youngest child \"was attacked with fits of immoderate laughter, nor could the threats of his father or mother refrain him.\"[9].",

(capital) of the department, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.Arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes..The term arrondissement can be roughly translated into English as district.[3].The administration of an arrondissement is assigned to a subprefect (French: sous-pr\u00e9fet) who assists the departmental prefect (pr\u00e9fet)..Unlike French regions, departments and communes, arrondissements do not have the status of legal entity in public law.In addition, unlike those other administrative divisions, they are not run by elected officials, but by political appointees, officials appointed by the French president..The concept of arrondissements was proposed several times as an administrative reform during the Ancien R\u00e9gime, notably by the intendant of the g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 of Brittany, Caze de La Bove, in his M\u00e9moire concernant les subd\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s de l'intendance de Bretagne in 1775..The arrondissements were created after the French Revolution by the Loi du 28 pluvi\u00f4se in the year VIII of the Republican Calendar (17 February 1800) and replaced \"districts\".In certain periods in French history, they have served a role in legislative elections, especially during the Third Republic.", "VAGINA": "In mammals, the vagina (pl.: vaginas or vaginae)[1] is the elastic, muscular part of the female genital tract.In humans, it extends from the vestibule to the cervix.The outer vaginal opening is normally partly covered by a thin layer of mucosal tissue called the hymen.At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the uterus) bulges into the vagina.The vagina allows for sexual intercourse and birth.It also channels menstrual flow, which occurs in humans and closely related primates as part of the menstrual cycle..Although research on the vagina is especially lacking for different animals, its location, structure and size are documented as varying among species.Female mammals usually have two external openings in the vulva; these are the urethral opening for the urinary tract and the vaginal opening for the genital tract.This is different from male mammals, who usually have a single urethral opening for both urination and reproduction.The vaginal opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the labia in humans.In amphibians, birds, reptiles and monotremes, the cloaca is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal, urinary, and reproductive tracts..To accommodate smoother penetration of the vagina during sexual intercourse or other sexual activity, vaginal moisture increases during sexual arousal in human females and other female mammals.", "Cincinnati Reds": "The Cincinnati Reds are an American professional baseball team based in Cincinnati.They compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division and were a charter member of the American Association in 1881 before joining the NL in 1890.[3][4].The Reds played in the NL West division from 1969 to 1993, before joining the Central division in 1994.For several years in the 1970s, they were considered the most dominant team in baseball, most notably winning the 1975 and 1976 World Series; the team was colloquially known as the \"Big Red Machine\" during this time, and it included Hall of Fame members Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan and Tony P\u00e9rez, as well as the controversial Pete Rose, the all-time hits leader.Overall, the Reds have won five World Series championships, nine NL pennants, one AA pennant and 10 division titles.The team plays its home games at Great American Ball Park, which opened in 2003.Bob Castellini has been the CEO of the Reds since 2006.From 1882 to 2022, the Reds' overall win\u2013loss record is 10,775\u201310,601 (a .504 winning percentage).[5].The origins of the modern Cincinnati Reds baseball team can be traced back to the expulsion from the National League of an earlier team bearing the same name.In 1876, Cincinnati became one of the charter members of the new National League (NL), but the club ran afoul of league organizer and longtime president William Hulbert for selling beer during games and renting out its ballpark on Sundays.Both were important in enticing the city's large German population to support the team.While Hulbert made clear his distaste for both beer and Sunday baseball at the founding of the league, neither practice was against league rules at the time.", "Stink bomb": "A stink bomb, sometimes called a stinkpot, is a device designed to create an unpleasant smell.They range in effectiveness from being used as simple pranks[1] to military grade malodorants or riot control chemical agents..A stink bomb that could be launched with arrows was invented by Leonardo da Vinci.[2].The 1972 U.S.presidential campaign of Edmund Muskie was disrupted at least four times in Florida in 1972 with the use of stink bombs during the Florida presidential primary.[3] Stink bombs were set off at campaign picnics in Miami and Tampa, at the Muskie campaign headquarters in Tampa and at offices in Tampa where the campaign's telephone bank was located.[3] The stink bomb plantings served to disrupt the picnics and campaign operations, and was deemed by the U.S.Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities of the U.S.Senate to have \"disrupted, confused, and unnecessarily interfered with a campaign for the office of the Presidency\".[3].In 2004, it was reported that the Israeli weapons research and development directorate had created a liquid stink bomb, dubbed the \"skunk bomb\", with an odor that lingers for five years on clothing.[4] It is a synthetic stink bomb based upon the chemistry of the spray that is emitted from the anal glands of the skunk.[4] It was designed as a crowd control tool to be used as a deterrent that causes people to scatter, such as at a protest.[4] It has been described as a less than lethal weapon.[4].At the lower end of the spectrum, relatively harmless stink bombs consist of a mixture of ammonium sulfide, vinegar and bicarbonate, which smells strongly of rotten eggs.[2] When exposed to air, the ammonium sulfide reacts with moisture, hydrolyzes, and a mixture of hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell) and ammonia is released.Another mixture consists of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia mixed together directly.[5].Other popular substances on which to base stink bombs are thiols with lower molecular weight such as methyl mercaptan and ethyl mercaptan\u2014the chemicals that are added in minute quantities to natural gas in order to make gas leaks detectable by smell.A variation on this idea is the scent bomb, or perfume bomb, filled with an overpowering \"cheap perfume\" smell..", "A picture is worth a thousand words": "\"A picture is worth a thousand words\" is an adage in multiple languages meaning that complex and sometimes multiple ideas[1] can be conveyed by a single still image, which conveys its meaning or essence more effectively than a mere verbal description..In March 1911, the Syracuse Advertising Men's Club held a banquet to discuss journalism and publicity.This was reported in two articles.In an article in The Post-Standard covering this event, the author quoted Arthur Brisbane (not Tess Flanders as previously reported here and elsewhere) as saying: \"Use a picture.It's worth a thousand words.\"[2]  In an article in the Printers' Ink, the same quote is attributed to Brisbane[3].A similar phrase, \"One Look Is Worth A Thousand Words\", appears in a 1913 newspaper advertisement for the Piqua Auto Supply House of Piqua, Ohio.[4].Early use of the exact phrase appears in a 1918 newspaper advertisement for the San Antonio Light, which says:.One of the Nation's Greatest Editors Says:.One Picture is Worth a Thousand Words The San Antonio Light's Pictorial Magazine of the War.Exemplifies the truth of the above statement\u2014judging from the warm.reception it has received at the hands of the Sunday Light readers.[5].The modern use of the phrase is generally attributed to Fred R.", "Economy of the Netherlands": "The economy of the Netherlands is the 18th largest in the world in 2021 (in terms of Gross domestic product; GDP) according to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.Its GDP per capita at purchasing power parity was estimated at $72,973 in the fiscal year 2023, which makes it one of the highest-earning nations in the world..The Netherlands has had steady natural gas resources since 1959, when a wellspring was discovered.Currently the Netherlands accounts for more than 25% of all natural gas reserves in the European Union.Over the following decades, the sale of natural gas generated a significant rise in revenue for the Netherlands.[20]  However, the unforeseen consequences of the country's energy wealth originally impacted the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy, leading to the theory of Dutch disease, after the discovery of the vast Groningen gas field.[20].The Netherlands has a prosperous and open economy, which depends heavily on foreign trade.The economy is noted for stable industrial relations, fairly low unemployment and inflation, a sizable current account surplus (which, compared to the size of the country, is even more than Germany) and an important role as a European transportation hub; Rotterdam is the biggest port in Europe; and Amsterdam has one of the biggest airports in the world.Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum refining, high-tech, financial services, the creative sector and electrical machinery.Its highly mechanised agricultural sector employs no more than 2% of the labour force, but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports.The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners, began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002..The Netherlands is a \"conduit country\" that helps to funnel profits from high-tax countries to tax havens.[21] It has been ranked as the 4th largest tax haven in the World.[22].The stern financial policy was abandoned in 2009, because of the then-current credit crises.", "Loyal to the Game": "Loyal to the Game is the ninth studio album and fifth posthumous studio album by American rapper Tupac Shakur.The album was produced by Eminem and consists of remixes of previously unreleased music recorded by Tupac before his death in 1996.Released in the United States on December 14, 2004, Loyal to the Game debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart.[3] It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[4].During an interview with MTV, Eminem stated he was so moved by Tupac's life and work that he wrote a letter to Tupac's mother, Afeni Shakur, asking her to consider letting him produce his next album.Shakur agreed, allowing Eminem to produce three new songs for the 2003 soundtrack album, Tupac: Resurrection, and the entirety of Loyal to the Game, bar bonus content.[5].All songs on the album were recorded prior to Tupac's involvement in the controversial East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry, serving as the second posthumous album released consisting of material from this time period, the first being 1997's R U Still Down? (Remember Me).Although the songs are mostly unreleased, the title track, \"Loyal to the Game\", was previously released on the cassette edition of the 1994 soundtrack album Above the Rim, and subsequently as the B-side to the album's lead single, \"Regulate\"..The album featured two singles:  \"Thugs Get Lonely Too\", which served as a promotional single for the album, and \"Ghetto Gospel\", which served as the lead single.[6] Originally, \"Ghetto Gospel\" was recorded for inclusion on the 1992 Christmas compilation A Very Special Christmas 2, but due to Tupac's legal troubles, the song was dropped from the album.[citation needed] This original version has a much faster tempo and features a third and fourth verse which didn't feature in Eminem's remix.[7][8].Loyal to the Game marks the only posthumous Tupac album not to feature any original production.When remixing these songs, Eminem used various unusual production techniques, namely, modifying the pace and pitch of Tupac's voice to better suit the instrumentals he produced.The style of the production on the album fitted more to the form of a Shady/Aftermath release, of which Eminem partly created, than it did to any original or previous posthumous Tupac release.[9] There were also various uses of cutting and pasting vocals to produce new words synonymous with rap culture at that time, such as making it sound as though Tupac is saying, \"2005\", \"G-Unit\", \"Obie Trice\" and \"Em\".[9].Although Loyal to the Game was produced by Eminem, the album does feature four bonus remixes, with production coming from Scott Storch, Red Spyda, Raphael Saadiq, and DJ Quik, though, the bonus track produced by Scott Storch, \"Po Nigga Blues\", does not feature in Eminem form on the main album.", "The View (U.S. TV series)": "The View is an American talk show created by broadcast journalist Barbara Walters.Currently in its 27th season, the show has aired on ABC as part of the network's daytime programming block since August 11, 1997.It features a multi-generational panel of women, who discuss the day's \"Hot Topics\", such as sociopolitical and entertainment news.In addition to the conversation segments, the panel also conducts interviews with prominent figures, such as celebrities and politicians.Production of the show was held in ABC Television Studio 23 in New York City.In 2014, it relocated to ABC Broadcast Center, also in New York City..Throughout its run, The View has had 24 permanent co-hosts of varying characteristics and ideologies, with the number of contracted permanent co-hosts ranging between four and eight women per season.The original panel comprised Walters, broadcast journalist Meredith Vieira, lawyer Star Jones, television host Debbie Matenopoulos, and comedian Joy Behar, while the current lineup consists of Behar, entertainer Whoopi Goldberg, lawyer Sunny Hostin, television host Sara Haines, television personality Ana Navarro, and political strategist Alyssa Farah Griffin.In addition, the show often makes use of male and female guest panelists..The View has won 31 Daytime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Talk Show, Outstanding Informative Talk Show, and Outstanding Talk Show Host.The show has received praise from the Associated Press, Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, Slate, as well as The New York Times, which deemed it \"the most important political TV show in America\".Beginning in its tenth season, the series became subject to on-air controversies and media criticism involving its panel of co-hosts.", "Prunus virginiana": "Prunus virginiana, commonly called bitter-berry,[3] chokecherry,[3] Virginia bird cherry,[3] and western chokecherry[3] (also black chokecherry for P.virginiana var.demissa),[3] is a species of bird cherry (Prunus subgenus Padus) native to North America..Chokecherry is a suckering shrub or small tree growing to 1\u20136 metres (3feet 3inches\u2013 19feet 8inches) tall, rarely to 10m (33ft) and exceptionally wide, 18m (60ft) with a trunk as thick as 30 centimetres (12in).[4] The leaves are oval, 2.5\u201310 centimetres (1\u20134 inches) long and 1.2\u20135cm (1\u20442\u20132in) wide, with a serrated margin.[5] The stems rarely exceed 2cm (3\u20444in) in length.[6].The flowers are produced in racemes 4\u201311cm (1+1\u20442\u20134+1\u20444in) long in late spring (well after leaf emergence), eventually growing up to 15cm.[4] They are 1\u20443\u20131\u20442 inch (8.47\u201312.70 millimetres) across.[7][8].The fruits (drupes) are about 6\u201314mm (1\u20444\u20131\u20442in) in diameter, range in color from bright red to black, and possess a very astringent taste, being both somewhat sour and somewhat bitter.They get darker and marginally sweeter as they ripen.[5] They each contain a large stone.[6].Chokecherry \u2013 habit.Leaf and drupes of Saskatchewan plant.Chokecherries are very high in antioxidant pigment compounds, such as anthocyanins.They share this property with chokeberries, further contributing to confusion.[5].The chokecherry is closely related to the black cherry (Prunus serotina) of eastern North America, which can reach 30m (100ft) tall and has larger leaves and darker fruit.The chokecherry leaf has a finely serrated margin and is dark green above with a paler underside, while the black cherry leaf has numerous blunt edges along its margin and is dark green and smooth.[5][9].", "Los Angeles International Airport": "Los Angeles International Airport (IATA: LAX, ICAO: KLAX, FAA LID: LAX), commonly referred to as LAX (with each letter pronounced individually), is the primary international airport serving Los Angeles, California and its surrounding metropolitan area.LAX is located in the Westchester neighborhood of Los Angeles, 18 miles (30km) southwest of Downtown Los Angeles, with the commercial and residential areas of Westchester to the north, the city of El Segundo to the south and the city of Inglewood to the east.LAX is the closest airport to the Westside and the South Bay..The airport is operated by Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), a branch of the Los Angeles city government, that also operates Van Nuys Airport for general aviation.The airport covers 3,500 acres (1,400ha) of land and has four parallel runways.[6][9].In 2019, LAX handled 88,068,013 passengers, making it the world's third-busiest and the United States' second-busiest airport following Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport.As the largest and busiest international airport on the U.S.West Coast, LAX is a major international gateway to the United States, and also serves a connection point for passengers travelling internationally (such as East and Southeast Asia, Australasia, Mexico and Central America).The airport holds the record for the world's busiest origin and destination airport,[10] because relative to other airports, many more travellers begin or end their trips in Los Angeles than use it as a connection.In 2019, LAWA reported approximately 88 percent of travellers at LAX were origination and destination (O&D) passengers, and 12 percent were connecting.[11] It is also the only airport to rank among the top five U.S.airports for both passenger and cargo traffic.[12] LAX serves as a major hub or focus city for more passenger airlines than any other airport in the United States..Although LAX is the busiest airport in the Greater Los Angeles Area, several other airports, including Hollywood Burbank Airport, John Wayne Airport (Orange County), Long Beach Airport, Ontario International Airport, and San Bernardino International Airport serve the region..", "Peyton Manning": "Peyton Williams Manning (born March 24, 1976) is an American former football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons.Nicknamed \"the Sheriff\",[1] he spent 14 seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and four with the Denver Broncos.[2] Manning is widely considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[3][4][5][6][7][8] A member of the Manning football dynasty, he is the second son of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and an older brother of former NFL quarterback Eli Manning.He played college football at Tennessee, where he won the Maxwell, Davey O'Brien, and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Awards as a senior en route to victory in the 1997 SEC Championship..Manning was selected first overall in the 1998 NFL Draft by the Colts, where he served as their starting quarterback from 1998 to 2010.He helped transform the struggling Colts franchise into consistent playoff contenders, leading them to 11 playoff appearances, eight division titles, three AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl appearances, and one championship title in Super Bowl XLI, the franchise's first in over three decades and first since relocating to Indianapolis.[9][10][11][12][13] Manning was also named Super Bowl MVP in the victory.After undergoing neck surgery that sidelined him for the 2011 season, Manning was released by the Colts and signed with the Broncos.Serving as the Broncos' starting quarterback from 2012 to 2015, he helped them clinch their division each season and reach two Super Bowls.Manning's career ended with a victory in Super Bowl 50, making him the first starting quarterback to win the Super Bowl for more than one franchise.[14].Manning holds many NFL records, including MVP awards,[15] quarterback first-team All-Pro selections,[16] 4,000-yard passing seasons,[17][18] single-season passing yards,[19] and single-season passing touchdowns.[20] He is also third in career passing yards and passing touchdowns.[21][22] Helping lead both the Colts and Broncos to two Super Bowls each, Manning is the only quarterback to have multiple Super Bowl starts with more than one franchise.He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2017 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021.[23].Manning went to Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he led the Greenies football team to a 34\u20135 record during his three seasons as the starter.[24] He was named Gatorade Circle of Champions National Player-of-the-Year and Columbus (Ohio) Touchdown Club National Offensive Player-of-the-Year in 1993.[25] While at Newman, he began wearing the #18 jersey in honor of his older brother Cooper, who had to give up football due to spinal stenosis.[26] Younger brother Eli also wore the number when he became starting quarterback.Newman has since retired the #18 jersey and it can be seen hanging in the school gym.[27] Manning was among the most sought after high school players in the country and was recruited by about 60 colleges, including Florida, Florida State, LSU, Michigan, Tennessee, Texas, Texas A&M, and his father's alma mater Ole Miss.[28].", "Baker Hughes": "Baker Hughes Company, incorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law and headquartered in Houston, is one of the world's largest oil field services companies.The company provides products and services for oil well drilling, formation evaluation, completion, production, and reservoir consulting.It operates in over 120 countries, with research and manufacturing facilities in Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Italy, Germany, Norway, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Missouri.From 2017 to 2020, the company was majority owned by General Electric (GE); however, GE no longer owns an economic stake in the company.[2].The company divides its organization into the following segments:[3].Baker Hughes traces its roots to the 1987 merger of Hughes Tool Company and Baker Oil Tool Company and the company has subsequently grown via acquisitions..The Hughes Tool Company was founded in 1908 by business partners Walter Benona Sharp and Howard R.Hughes, Sr., father of Howard Hughes, Jr.That year, Hughes, Sr.and Sharp developed the first two-cone drill bit, designed to enable rotary drilling in harder, deeper formations than was possible with earlier fishtail bits.They conducted two secret tests on a drilling rig in Goose Creek, Texas.Each time, Hughes asked the drilling crew to leave the rig floor, pulled the bit from a locked wooden box, and then his associates ran the bit into the hole.", "Penny (United States coin)": "The cent, the United States of America one-cent coin (symbol: \u00a2), often called the \"penny\", is a unit of currency equaling one one-hundredth of a United States of America dollar.It has been the lowest face-value physical unit of U.S.currency since the abolition of the half-cent in 1857 (the abstract mill, which has never been minted, equal to a tenth of a cent, continues to see limited use in the fields of taxation and finance).The first U.S.cent was produced in 1787, and the cent has been issued primarily as a copper or copper-plated coin throughout its history.Due to inflation, pennies have lost virtually all their purchasing power and are often viewed as an expensive burden to businesses, banks, government (especially mints) and the public in general..The penny is issued in its current form as the Lincoln cent, with its obverse featuring the profile of President Abraham Lincoln since 1909, the centennial of his birth.From 1959 (the sesquicentennial of Lincoln's birth) to 2008, the reverse featured the Lincoln Memorial.Four different reverse designs in 2009 honored Lincoln's 200th birthday and a new, \"permanent\" reverse \u2013 the Union Shield \u2013 was introduced in 2010.The coin is 0.75inches (19.05mm) in diameter and 0.0598inches (1.52mm) in thickness.The current copper-plated zinc cent issued since 1982 weighs 2.5 grams, while the previous 95% copper cent still found in circulation weighed 3.11 g (see further below)..The U.S.", "Koi": "Koi (\u9bc9, English: /\u02c8k\u0254\u026a/, Japanese: [ko\ua71ci]), or more specifically nishikigoi (\u9326\u9bc9, Japanese: [\u0272i\u0255i\u0325ki\ua71c\u0261oi], literally \"brocaded carp\"), are colored varieties of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) that are kept for decorative purposes in outdoor koi ponds or water gardens.In recent years, there has been a trend to distinguish the East Asian Amur carp (Cyprinus rubrofuscus) as a separate species among the common carp, so the scientific name koi may be changed in the future..Koi is an informal name for the colored variants of \tC.carpio kept for ornamental purposes.There are many varieties of ornamental koi, originating from breeding that began in Niigata, Japan in the early 19th century.[1][2][3] Several varieties are recognized by the Japanese, distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation.Some of the major colors are white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue, brown and cream, besides metallic shades like gold and silver-white ('platinum') scales.The most popular category of koi is the Gosanke, which is made up of the K\u014dhaku, Taish\u014d Sanshoku and Sh\u014dwa Sanshoku varieties..Carp are a large group of fish originally found in Central Europe and Asia.Various carp species were originally domesticated in China, where they were used as food fish.Carp are coldwater fish, and their ability to survive and adapt to many climates and water conditions allowed the domesticated species to be propagated to many new locations, including Japan..In Japan, Miocene fossils of the carp family (Cyprinidae) have been excavated from Iki Island in Nagasaki Prefecture.[4] In addition, numerous carp pharyngeal teeth have been excavated from Jomon and Yayoi period sites.[5] For example, pharyngeal teeth of the extinct species J\u014dmon Koi (Cyprinus sp.) as well as the present species of carp (Cyprinus carpio or Cyprinus rubrofuscus) have been excavated from the Akanoi Bay lakebed site (\u8d64\u91ce\u4e95\u6e7e\u6e56\u5e95\u907a\u8de1) in Lake Biwa at the end of the Early Jomon Period (11,500 - 7,000 years ago).[5] In addition, pharyngeal teeth of all six subfamilies of the carp family living in Japan today, including carp, have been found at the Awazu lakebed site (\u7c9f\u6d25\u6e56\u5e95\u907a\u8de1) dating from the Middle Jomon Period (5500 - 4400 years ago).[5].There are differences in the length distribution of carp excavated from Jomon and Yayoi sites, as estimated from the size of their pharyngeal teeth.", "American Federation of Government Employees": "The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) is an American labor union representing over 750,000 employees of the federal government, about 5,000 employees of the District of Columbia, and a few hundred private sector employees, mostly in and around federal facilities.AFGE is the largest union for civilian, non-postal federal employees and the largest union for District of Columbia employees who report directly to the mayor (i.e., outside D.C.public schools).It is affiliated with the AFL\u2013CIO..AFGE was founded on October 17, 1932, by local unions loyal to the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and left the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE) when that union became independent of the AFL (NFFE in 1998 became part of the IAMAW, which is affiliated with the AFL\u2013CIO)..AFGE is a federation of local unions, with each local maintaining autonomy through operating under local constitutions that comply with the AFGE National constitution ratified originally during its founding in 1932..Federal employees' right to organize and bargain binding labor contracts was established in law by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which AFGE helped to draft, and which states that collective bargaining in the federal sector is in the public interest while also barring the right to strike..AFGE has played a crucial role[according to whom?] in the struggle for women's rights and civil rights in the federal sector, and was one of the first unions to establish a Women's Department and a Fair Practices Department, with the officer over those departments holding a seat on the National Executive Committee (NEC) and with Women's and Fair Practices Coordinators elected in each AFGE district since the early 1970s..AFGE's December 2009 court suits stopped aspects of the George W.Bush Administration's \"National Security Personnel System\" (for DOD) and MAXHR (for DHS), and AFGE also won changes to law that make the contracting out process more balanced[according to whom?] in regard to federal employees' interests.In 2010, the Obama Administration issued an Executive Order for the Federal Government to focus on insourcing Federal jobs rather than outsourcing them overseas or to contractors..AFGE's motto was established as \"To Do For All That Which No One Can Do For Oneself\"..", "Evolutionary history of plants": "The evolution of plants has resulted in a wide range of complexity, from the earliest algal mats of unicellular archaeplastids evolved through endosymbiosis, through multicellular marine and freshwater green algae, to spore-bearing terrestrial bryophytes, lycopods and ferns, and eventually to the complex seed-bearing gymnosperms and angiosperms (flowering plants) of today.While many of the earliest groups continue to thrive, as exemplified by red and green algae in marine environments, more recently derived groups have displaced previously ecologically dominant ones; for example, the ascendance of flowering plants over gymnosperms in terrestrial environments.[1]:\u200a498.There is evidence that cyanobacteria and multicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes lived in freshwater communities on land as early as 1 billion years ago,[2] and that communities of complex, multicellular photosynthesizing organisms existed on land in the late Precambrian, around 850million years ago.[3].Evidence of the emergence of embryophyte land plants first occurs in the mid-Ordovician (~470million years ago), and by the middle of the Devonian (~390million years ago), many of the features recognised in land plants today were present, including roots and leaves.By the late Devonian (~370million years ago) some free-sporing plants such as Archaeopteris had secondary vascular tissue that produced wood and had formed forests of tall trees.Also by the late Devonian, Elkinsia, an early seed fern, had evolved seeds.[4].Evolutionary innovation continued throughout the rest of the Phanerozoic eon and still continues today.Most plant groups were relatively unscathed by the Permo-Triassic extinction event, although the structures of communities changed.This may have set the scene for the appearance of the flowering plants in the Triassic (~200million years ago), and their later diversification in the Cretaceous and Paleogene.The latest major group of plants to evolve were the grasses, which became important in the mid-Paleogene, from around 40million years ago.The grasses, as well as many other groups, evolved new mechanisms of metabolism to survive the low CO2 and warm, dry conditions of the tropics over the last 10 millionyears..Land plants evolved from a group of freshwater green algae, perhaps as early as 850 mya,[3] but algae-like plants might have evolved as early as 1 billion years ago.[2] The closest living relatives of land plants are the charophytes, specifically Charales; assuming that the habit of the Charales has changed little since the divergence of lineages, this means that the land plants evolved from a branched, filamentous alga dwelling in shallow fresh water,[5] perhaps at the edge of seasonally desiccating pools.[6] However, some recent evidence suggests that land plants might have originated from unicellular terrestrial charophytes similar to extant Klebsormidiophyceae.[7] The alga would have had a haplontic life cycle.", "List of Super Bowl champions": "The Super Bowl is the annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL).The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs.The winner receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy.The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand,[1] usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums.[2] Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs..Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in four such contests.The first two were marketed as the \"AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game\", but were also casually referred to as \"the Super Bowl game\" during the television broadcast.[3] Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the \"Super Bowl\" moniker in official marketing; the names \"Super Bowl I\" and \"Super Bowl II\" were retroactively applied to the first two games.[4].A total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl.[5] There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season..The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII.Only two franchises have ever won the Super Bowl while hosting at their home stadiums: the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV and the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI..Numbers in parentheses in the table are Super Bowl appearances as of the date of that Super Bowl and are used as follows:.W  Indicates a team that made the playoffs as a wild card team (rather than by winning a division)..Seven franchises have won consecutive Super Bowls, one of which (Pittsburgh) has accomplished it twice:.", "Martin County, Texas": "Martin County is a county in the U.S.state of Texas.As of the 2020 census, its population was 5,237.[2] Its county seat is Stanton.[3] The county was created in 1876 and organized in 1884.[4] It is named for Wylie Martin, an early settler.[1].Until November 2018, Martin County was one of six[5] entirely dry counties in Texas.During that month, Martin County changed from a dry county to a partially wet[6] county after Stanton residents voted to approve the sale of beer and wine within city limits.[7] Five dry counties remain.[8][9].Martin County is included in the Midland\u2013Odessa combined statistical area..According to the U.S.Census Bureau, the county has an area of 916 square miles (2,370km2), of which 915 square miles (2,370km2) is land and 0.7 square miles (1.8km2) (0.08%) is water.[10] The northern portion of the Spraberry Trend, the second-largest oil field in the United States by 2013 estimated crude oil production, underlies much of the county.[11].Note: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.This table excludes Latinos from the racial categories and assigns them to a separate category.Hispanics/Latinos can be of any race..As of the census[16] of 2000, there were 4,746 people, 1,624 households, and 1,256 families residing in the county.", "Alkaline phosphatase": "The enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP, alkaline phenyl phosphatase) has the physiological role of dephosphorylating compounds.The enzyme is found across a multitude of organisms, prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike, with the same general function but in different structural forms suitable to the environment they function in.Alkaline phosphatase is found in the periplasmic space of E.coli bacteria.This enzyme is heat stable and has its maximum activity at high pH.In humans, it is found in many forms depending on its origin within the body\u2013 it plays an integral role in metabolism within the liver and development within the skeleton.Due to its widespread prevalence in these areas, its concentration in the bloodstream is used by diagnosticians as a biomarker in helping determine diagnoses such as hepatitis or osteomalacia.[2].The level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood is checked through the ALP test, which is often part of routine blood tests.The levels of this enzyme in the blood depend on factors such as age, sex, or blood type.[2] Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase also increase by two to four times during pregnancy.This is a result of additional alkaline phosphatase produced by the placenta and the liver.[3][4] Additionally, abnormal levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood could indicate issues relating to the liver, gall bladder or bones.Kidney tumors and infections as well as malnutrition have also shown abnormal level of alkaline phosphatase in blood.[2] Alkaline phosphatase levels in a cell can be measured through a process called \"The scoring method\".A blood smear is usually taken and stained to categorize each leukocyte into specific \"leukocyte alkaline phosphatase indices\".This marker is designed to distinguish leukocytes and determine different enzyme activity from each sample's extent of staining.[5].", "Triticale": "\u00d7 Triticale Tscherm.-Seys.ex M\u00fcntzing.Triticale (/tr\u026at\u026a\u02c8ke\u026ali\u02d0/; \u00d7 Triticosecale) is a hybrid of wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Germany.[1] Commercially available triticale is almost always a second-generation hybrid, i.e., a cross between two kinds of primary (first-cross) triticales.As a rule, triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance (including soil conditions) of rye.Only recently[when?] has it been developed into a commercially viable crop.Depending on the cultivar, triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents.It is grown mostly for forage or fodder, although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores and can be found in some breakfast cereals..When crossing wheat and rye, wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent (pollen donor).The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself..The primary producers of triticale are Poland, Germany, Belarus, France and Russia.In 2014, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 17.1 million tons were harvested in 37 countries across the world.[2].The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid, which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species.", "Puff, the Magic Dragon": "\"Puff, the Magic Dragon\" (or just \"Puff\") is a song written by Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary from a poem by Leonard Lipton.It was made popular by Peter, Paul and Mary in a 1962 recording released in January 1963..Lipton wrote a poem about a dragon in 1959,[1] and, when Yarrow found it, he wrote the lyrics to \"Puff\" based on the poem.After the song was released, Yarrow searched for Lipton to give him credit for the song.[2].The lyrics for \"Puff, the Magic Dragon\" are based on a 1959 poem by Leonard Lipton, then a 19-year-old Cornell University student.[1] Lipton was inspired by an Ogden Nash poem titled \"The Tale of Custard the Dragon\", about a \"realio, trulio little pet dragon\".[3][4][5].The lyrics tell a story of the ageless dragon, Puff, and his playmate, Jackie Paper, a little boy who grows up and moves on from the imaginary adventures of childhood, leaving a disheartened Puff on his own.The song's story takes place \"by the sea\" in the fictional land of \"Honah Lee\"..Lipton was friends with Yarrow's housemate when they were all students at Cornell.He used Yarrow's typewriter to get the poem out of his head.He then forgot about it until years later, when a friend called and told him Yarrow was looking for him, to give him credit for the lyrics.On making contact, Yarrow gave Lipton half the songwriting credit, and he received royalties to the song until his death in 2022..Yarrow now sings the line \"A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys\" as \"A dragon lives forever, but not so girls and boys\", to be fair to boys and girls.[6] The original poem had a stanza not incorporated into the song.", "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS": "A national championship in the highest level of college football in the United States, currently the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), is a designation awarded annually by various organizations to their selection of the best college football team.Division I FBS football is the only National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) sport for which the NCAA does not sanction a yearly championship event.As such, it is sometimes unofficially referred to as a \"mythical national championship\".[1][2][3][4].Due to the lack of an official NCAA title, determining the nation's top college football team has often engendered controversy.[5] A championship team is independently declared by multiple individuals and organizations, often referred to as \"selectors\".[6] These choices are not always unanimous.[5] In 1969 even President of the United States Richard Nixon made a selection by announcing, ahead of the season-ending \"game of the century\" between No.1 Texas and No.2 (AP) Arkansas, that the winner would receive a presidential plaque commemorating them as national champions.[7] Texas went on to win, 15\u201314.[7].While the NCAA has never officially endorsed a championship team, it has documented the choices of some selectors in its official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records publication.[6][8] In addition, various analysts have independently published their own choices for each season.These opinions can often diverge with others as well as individual schools' claims to national titles, which may or may not correlate to the selections published elsewhere.Currently, two of the most widely recognized national champion selectors are the Associated Press (AP), which conducts a poll of sportswriters, and the Coaches Poll, a survey of active members of the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA)..Since 1992, various consortia of major bowl games have aimed to invite the top two teams at the end of the regular season (as determined by internal rankings, or aggregates of the major polls and other statistics) to compete in what is intended to be the de facto national championship game.The current iteration of this practice, the College Football Playoff, selects four teams to participate in national semi-finals hosted by two of six partner bowl games, with their winners advancing to the College Football Playoff National Championship..The concept of a national championship in college football dates to the early years of the sport in the late 19th century.[9] Some of the earliest contemporaneous rankings can be traced to Caspar Whitney in Harper's Weekly, J.", "Milwaukee Brewers": "The Milwaukee Brewers are an American professional baseball team based in Milwaukee.They compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division.The Brewers are named for the city's association with the brewing industry and shares its name with several other baseball teams that have called Milwaukee home.[4] Since 2001, they have played their home games at American Family Field, which was named Miller Park through the 2020 season and has a seating capacity of 41,900 people..The team was founded as the Seattle Pilots, an expansion team that joined the American League (AL) and began play in Seattle, Washington in 1969.The Pilots played their home games at Sick's Stadium.After only one season, the team relocated to Milwaukee, becoming known as the Brewers and playing their home games at Milwaukee County Stadium.In 1998, the Brewers joined the National League.They are the only franchise to play in four different divisions since the advent of divisional play in Major League Baseball in 1969.They are also one of two current MLB franchises to switch leagues in the modern era (1900\u2013present); the other franchise is the Houston Astros..The Brewers appeared in the World Series in 1982, and they are one of only five current MLB teams that have never won the World Series.[5] The Brewers are also the oldest MLB team to never win the World Series along with the San Diego Padres and, at 55 seasons, have the second-longest active championship drought in the MLB behind the Cleveland Guardians.After winning the 1982 American League Championship Series (ALCS) against the California Angels, the Brewers faced off against the St.Louis Cardinals in the World Series, losing 4\u20133.", "Washington Nationals": "The Washington Nationals are an American professional baseball team based in Washington, D.C.They compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the National League (NL) East division.From 2005 to 2007, the team played in RFK Stadium while a new stadium was being built.In 2008, they moved to Nationals Park, located on South Capitol Street in the Navy Yard neighborhood of the Southeast quadrant of D.C., near the Anacostia River.[5].The Nationals are the eighth major league franchise to be based in  Washington, D.C., and the first since 1971.The current franchise was founded in 1969 as the Montreal Expos as part of a four-team expansion.After a failed contraction plan, the Expos were purchased by MLB, which sought to move the team to a new city.[6] Washington, D.C., was chosen in 2004, and the Nationals were established in 2005 as the first MLB franchise move since the third Washington Senators moved to Texas in 1971..While the team initially struggled after moving to Washington, the Nationals had considerable success throughout the 2010s.The team had two back-to-back first overall picks in the MLB draft in 2009 and 2010, where they drafted Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper.The team secured their first playoff berth and first division title in 2012.They won the National League East again in 2014, 2016, and 2017, but failed to advance past the NLDS each time.In 2019, the team advanced to the World Series and defeated the Houston Astros in seven games to earn their first championship..", "Contingent fee": "A contingent fee (also known as a contingency fee in the United States or a conditional fee in England and Wales) is any fee for services provided where the fee is payable only if there is a favourable result.Although such a fee may be used in many fields, it is particularly well associated with legal practice..In the law, a contingent fee is defined as a fee charged for a lawyer's services that is payable only if a lawsuit is successful or results in a favorable settlement, usually in the form of a percentage of the amount recovered on behalf of the client.[1] Contingent fees may make it easier for people of limited means to pursue their civil rights since otherwise, to sue someone for a tort, one must first be wealthy enough to pursue such litigation in the first place.[2] Due to the risk of loss, attorneys will not take cases on a contingency basis unless they believe that the case has merit, although accepting cases on a contingency is not without risk.[3].Under a traditional contingency fee arrangement, a client is not charged attorney fees if he loses the case.If the client recovers damages from settlement or a favorable verdict, the attorney receives the fee from the recovery.The attorney's permitted fee varies depending on the country, and even local jurisdictions..For example, in the U.S.a contingency fee is based on the contractual agreement between the attorney and the party.The fee is calculated as a share of the eventual damage judgment or settlement obtained by the client.The percentage allowable as a contingency fee is subject to the ethical rules of professional conduct that require legal fees to be reasonable and, in some circumstances, by statutory limitations.[4] In some jurisdictions, contingent fees as high as 33% to 45% of recovery may be deemed reasonable.Attorneys charging unreasonable fees may be subject to professional sanctions..In the alternative, the contingency may come in the form of an additional charge that is added to a negotiated attorney fee in the event of success as defined by the parties in their fee contract.", "Convocation": "A convocation (from the Latin convocare meaning \"to call/come together\", a translation of the Greek \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 ekkl\u0113sia) is a group of people formally assembled for a special purpose, mostly ecclesiastical or academic..In academic use, it can refer variously to a gathering of all of an institution's alumni, to a ceremony at the start of the academic year to welcome incoming students, and to a graduation ceremony (sometimes otherwise known as a commencement)..A synodical assembly of a church is at times called \"Convocation\".The Convocations of Canterbury and York were the synodical assemblies of the two Provinces of the Church of England until the Church Assembly was established in 1920.[1] Their origins date back to the end of the seventh century when Theodore of Tarsus (Archbishop of Canterbury, 668-690) reorganized the structures of the English Church and established a national synod of bishops.With the recognition of York as a separate province in 733, this synod was divided into two.[1] In 1225, representatives of the cathedral and monastic chapters were included for the first time and in 1285 the membership of the Convocation of Canterbury assumed the basic form which it retained till 1921: Bishops, Abbots (till the 1530s and the Dissolution of the Monasteries), Deans, and Archdeacons, plus one representative of each cathedral chapter and two for the clergy from each diocese.[1] By the fifteenth century, each convocation was divided into an upper house (the Bishops) and a lower house (the remaining members).[1] In 1921, the number of proctors (elected representatives) of the diocesan clergy was increased to make them a majority in the lower houses..The Convocation of York was a relatively small part of the Church in England and Wales with only five member dioceses in Henry VIII's reign.[a] In 1462 it decided that all the provincial constitutions [b] of Canterbury which were not repugnant or prejudicial to its own should be allowed in the Northern Province[2] and by 1530 the Archbishop of York rarely attended sessions and the custom that York waited to see what Canterbury had decided and either accepted or rejected it was well established.The Convocation of York was, in practice, taking second place to that of Canterbury[2] so much so that in 1852 the Archbishop of York Thomas Musgrave stated that since the time of Henry VIII the archbishop had only attended personally two sessions (in 1689 and 1708).[2].The legislative powers of the convocations varied considerably over the centuries.Until 1664, they (not Parliament) determined the taxes to be paid by the clergy, but their powers in general were severely curtailed by Henry VIII in 1532/4;[c] and from the time of the Reformation till 1965 they were summoned and dissolved at the same time as Parliament.[1] Under Henry VIII and his successor Edward VI between 1534 and 1553 the Convocations were used as a source of clerical opinion but ecclesiastical legislation was secured by statute from Parliament.[3] Later between 1559 and 1641, Elizabeth I, James I and Charles I gave the force of law to decisions of Convocation without recourse to Parliament by letters patent under the great seal notably the Thirty-Nine Articles (1571) and the 141 Canons of 1603.[3].The Convocations were abolished during the Commonwealth but restored on the accession of Charles II in 1660 and they synodically approved the Book of Common Prayer which was imposed by the Act of Uniformity in 1662.[4] Formal sessions at the start of each parliament continued but no real business was discussed until after the Revolution of 1688 which brought William III and Mary II to the throne when attempts to include some of the Protestant dissenters met such resistance in the lower house that the government abandoned them and the Convocations resumed their purely formal meetings[4].In 1697 Francis Atterbury published his Letter to a Convocation Man concerning the Rights, Powers and Privileges of that Body which, in essence, claimed that the Convocation was an estate of the realm like Parliament and that the lower clergy were being illegally disfranchised and denied its proper voice in government.[5] Business was resumed in 1701 and by the time Queen Anne died in 1714 draft canons and forms of service had been drawn up for royal assent.[4] However, there was an inherent tension between the two houses, the lower house was mainly Tory in its politics and high church in its doctrine while the upper house was mainly Whig and latitudinarian and therefore in favour of toleration for Protestant dissenters and their possible reincorporation into the Church of England and feelings ran high until in 1717 the session was prorogued by Royal Writ to avoid the censuring of Bishop Benjamin Hoadly by the lower house (see the Bangorian controversy) and with the exception of an abortive session in 1741 the Convocations met only for formal business at the beginning of each parliament until the middle of the nineteenth century when Canterbury (in 1852) and York (in 1861) began to discuss issues of the day..The resumption of proper business was brought about by the political changes which had taken place some twenty years earlier.", "Sons of Anarchy": "Sons of Anarchy is an American action crime drama television series created by Kurt Sutter for FX.Originally aired from October 3, 2008, to December 9, 2014, Sons of Anarchy follows the lives of a close-knit outlaw motorcycle club operating in Charming, a fictional town in California's Central Valley.Charlie Hunnam stars as Jackson \"Jax\" Teller, who is initially the vice president and subsequently the president of the club.After discovering a manifesto written by his late father, John, who previously led the club, he begins to question himself, his relationships, and the club.Themes throughout the show include love, brotherhood, loyalty, betrayal and redemption.It explored vigilantism, government corruption and racism.The show's plot depicted an outlaw motorcycle club as an analogy for human transformation.David Labrava, a real-life member of the Oakland chapter of Hells Angels, served as a technical adviser, and also played the recurring character Happy Lowman, the club's assassin..Sons of Anarchy had the third season attract an average of 4.9 million weekly viewers, becoming FX's highest-rated series at the time and surpassing its other hits The Shield, Nip/Tuck and Rescue Me.The season 4 and 5 premieres were the two highest-rated telecasts in FX's history.[4] The sixth season aired from September 10, 2013, through December 10, 2013.The seventh season of the series premiered on September 9, 2014.On November 3, 2014, FX announced that the seventh season would be its last.", "Gr\u00c3\u00admsv\u00c3\u00b6tn": "", "Vetting": "Vetting is the process of performing a background check on someone before offering them employment, conferring an award, or doing fact-checking prior to making any decision.In addition, in intelligence gathering, assets are vetted to determine their usefulness.[1].To vet was originally a horse-racing term, referring to the requirement that a horse be checked for health and soundness by a veterinarian before being allowed to race.Thus, it has taken the general meaning \"to check\".[2].It is a figurative contraction of veterinarian, which originated in the mid-17th century.The colloquial abbreviation dates to the 1860s; the verb form of the word, meaning \"to treat an animal,\" came a few decades later\u2014according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest known usage is 1891[3]\u2014and was applied primarily in a horse-racing context (\"He vetted the stallion before the race,\" \"You should vet that horse before he races\", etc.)..By the early 1900s, vet had begun to be used as a synonym for evaluate, especially in the context of searching for flaws..[4].Candidates for political office are often thoroughly vetted..In the United States, following longstanding convention, a party's presidential nominee is expected to choose a vice presidential candidate to accompany them on their ticket.The practical reason for this is to ensure that presidential electors who are pledged to vote for a particular candidate for president can also be pledged to vote for a particular and separate candidate for vice president, thus making it highly likely that a clear majority of electors will elect political allies for president and vice president in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Twelfth Amendment..As a rule, in modern presidential elections, no person will be seriously considered for the vice presidential nomination without first undergoing a thorough evaluation by a team of advisers acting on behalf of the nominee.[5]  In later stages of the vetting process, the team will examine such items as a prospective vice presidential candidate's finances, personal conduct, and previous coverage in the media.[5]  The hurried vetting that preceded the selection by Republican nominee John McCain of his running mate Sarah Palin in 2008 was seen by many political observers as a mistake.[6].", "Caesars Entertainment Corporation": "Harrah's Entertainment (later named Caesars Entertainment Corporation, previously The Promus Companies) was an American casino and hotel company founded in Reno, Nevada, and based in Paradise, Nevada, that operated over 50 properties and seven golf courses under several brands.In 2013, it was the fourth-largest gambling company in the world,[1] with annual revenues of $8.6billion.It was acquired in 2020 by Eldorado Resorts, which then changed its own name to Caesars Entertainment..At the end of its existence, Caesars was a public company, majority-owned by a group of private equity firms led by Apollo Global Management, TPG Capital, and Paulson & Co.; and Carl Icahn.Caesars's largest operating unit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2015,[2][3] which led to the foundation of Vici Properties as a result..The company's background can be traced to October 29, 1937, when Bill Harrah opened a small bingo parlor in Reno, Nevada, a predecessor to Harrah's Reno.[4][5] In 1955, he expanded to Stateline, Nevada, on the south shore of Lake Tahoe, where he would eventually open Harrah's Lake Tahoe.[6].Harrah's Inc.made its initial public offering in 1971.[7] In 1972, it was listed on the American Stock Exchange and in 1973, Harrah's became the first casino company listed on the New York Stock Exchange..Bill Harrah died at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, at the age of 66, during a cardiac surgery operation to repair an aortic aneurysm.[8].In February 1980, Holiday Inn acquired Harrah's, Inc.for $300 million.Liquidation of Harrah's collection of almost 7,000 antique automobiles reportedly returned the full purchase price of the company to Holiday Inn.", "Permanent resident (Canada)": "Permanent residency (PR) in Canada is a status granting someone who is not a  Canadian citizen the right to live and work in Canada without any time limit on their stay.[1] To become a permanent resident a foreign national must apply to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), formerly known as Citizenship and Immigration Canada, under one of several programs.In addition to the conferred right of abode in Canada, a primary benefit of permanent residency is the eligibility to apply for Canadian citizenship after a certain period of permanent residency..A permanent resident holds many of the same rights and responsibilities as a Canadian citizen, including the right to live, work (subject to some restrictions), and study in any province or territory of Canada.Permanent residents participate in many of the same social benefits that Canadian citizens receive, including becoming contributing members of the Canada Pension Plan and receiving coverage by their province or territory's universal health care system.All permanent residents may avail themselves of the rights, freedoms, and protections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, other than those exclusively granted to citizens..Permanent residents may apply for Canadian citizenship after living in Canada for a certain amount of time.Currently, a person must have been living in Canada as a Permanent Resident for three years (1095 days) out of the five years preceding their application (with up to one year of the time before becoming a permanent resident included).[2] They also have the right to sponsor relatives for permanent residence, subject to fulfilling residence criteria and assurance of support requirements..Permanent residents do not have the right to vote in elections in Canada nor can they run for elected office in any level of government.Several municipal governments in Canada\u2014including Toronto, Vancouver, Halifax, and Calgary\u2014have proposed giving permanent residents the right to vote in municipal elections but that would require approval from their respective provincial governments.[3] For national security reasons, permanent residents also cannot hold jobs in either the public or private sectors that require a high-level security clearance..As non-citizens, permanent residents must use the passport of their current nationality in combination with a permanent resident card for international travel because they cannot be issued Canadian passports.Some countries will grant visa-free entry to Canadian permanent residents even if their current nationality would not typically qualify.To re-enter Canada on a commercial carrier (flight, bus, etc) a permanent resident must present either their permanent resident card or a Permanent Resident Travel Document issued by a Canadian diplomatic office..", "Erica Kane": "Erica Kane is a fictional character from the American ABC Daytime soap opera All My Children.The character was portrayed by actress Susan Lucci from her debut on January 16, 1970, until the last broadcast television episode on September 23, 2011.[1][2] Lucci was expected to guest star on Prospect Park's continuation of All My Children in 2013, but the appearance never came to fruition due to the show's second cancellation.[3].Erica is considered to be the most popular character in American soap opera history.[4] TV Guide calls her \"unequivocally the most famous soap opera character in the history of daytime TV,\"[5] and included her in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.[6].Agnes Nixon created Erica Kane in the 1960s as part of the story bible for All My Children, a light-hearted soap opera focusing on social issues and young love.[7] Nixon unsuccessfully attempted to sell the series to NBC, then to CBS, and once again to NBC through Procter & Gamble.[8] With Procter & Gamble unable to make room for the new series in its line up, she put All My Children on hold.Nixon became head writer of Another World where she used the model of the Erica character to create a brand new character: Rachel Davis.Nixon said Rachel was Erica's \"precursor to the public.\"  She detailed Rachel's goals as less \"stratospheric\" in nature since her primary motivation involved marrying Dr.Russ Mathews or a man with money while Erica wanted love, independence, and fame.\"What Erica and Rachel have in common is they thought if they could get their dream, they'd be satisfied,\" Nixon said.\"But that dream has been elusive.\"[9][10].After the success of One Life to Live, a series Nixon created in 1968, ABC asked her to create another soap opera for them.She used the story bible for All My Children to create the new program.The Erica character officially debuted in 1970 once All My Children made it onto the air.[7].", "Consumer Price Index": "A consumer price index (CPI) is a price index, the price of a weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households.Changes in measured CPI track changes in prices over time.[1] The CPI is calculated by using a representative basket of goods and services.The basket is updated periodically to reflect changes in consumer spending habits.The prices of the goods and services in the basket are collected monthly from a sample of retail and service establishments.The prices are then adjusted for changes in quality or features.[citation needed] Changes in the CPI can be used to track inflation over time and to compare inflation rates between different countries.The CPI is not a perfect measure of inflation or the cost of living, but it is a useful tool for tracking these economic indicators.[2].A CPI is a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically.Sub-indices and sub-sub-indices can be computed for different categories and sub-categories of goods and services, which are combined to produce the overall index with weights reflecting their shares in the total of the consumer expenditures covered by the index.It is one of several price indices calculated by most national statistical agencies.The annual percentage change in the CPI is used as a measure of inflation.A CPI can be used to index (i.e., adjust for the effect of inflation) the real value of wages, salaries, and pensions; to regulate prices; and to deflate monetary magnitudes to show changes in real values.", "Knocking on wood": "Knocking on wood (also phrased touching wood or touch wood) is an apotropaic tradition of literally touching, tapping, or knocking on wood, or merely stating that one is doing or intending to do so, in order to avoid \"tempting fate\" after making a favorable prediction or boast, or a declaration concerning one's own death or another unfavorable situation..A common explanation traces the phenomenon to ancient Celtic peoples, who believed it called on spirits or gods of the trees,[1][2] while Christians tie the practice to the wood of the cross of crucifixion.[2] A more modern theory from folklore researcher Steve Roud suggests it derives from a form of tag called \"Tiggy Touchwood\" in which players are safe from being tagged if they are touching wood.[2] The British version of the phrase \"touch wood\" has been traced back as far as the 17th century.[3].Another origin of knocking on wood is on old English Sailing Boats.Carved wooden sailors heads would be seen on the main deck.This was thought to protect the sailors from ghosts believed to be living within the rigging.[4].Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate.HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload file.Create

typically transfers the motion of a pushrod to the corresponding intake/exhaust valve..Rocker arms in automobiles are typically made from stamped steel, or aluminum in higher-revving applications.Some rocker arms (called roller rockers) include a bearing at the contact point, to reduce wear and friction at the contact point..In the typical use-case of an overhead valve (pushrod) engine, the camshaft at the bottom of the engine pushes the pushrod upwards.The top of the pushrod presses upwards on one side of the rocker arm (located at the top of the engine), which causes the rocker arm to rotate.This rotation causes the other end of the rocker arm to press downwards on the top of the valve, which opens the valve by moving it downwards..A roller rocker is a rocker arm that uses needle bearings (or a single bearing ball in older engines) at the contact point between the rocker and the valve, instead of metal sliding on metal.This reduces friction, uneven wear and \"bell-mouthing\" of the valve guide.[1] Roller rockers can also be used in overhead cam engines.However, these generally have the roller at the point where the cam lobe contacts the rocker, rather than at the point where the rocker contacts the valve stem..Friction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller tip.A similar arrangement transfers the motion via another roller tip to a second rocker arm.[clarification needed] This rotates about the rocker shaft, and transfers the motion via a tappet to the valve..Some overhead camshaft engines employ short rocker arms, also known as fingers, in which the cam lobe pushes down (rather than up) on the rocker arm to open the valve.", "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia": "\"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\" is a Southern Gothic murder ballad, written in 1972 by songwriter Bobby Russell and first recorded by his then wife, singer, comedian, and actress Vicki Lawrence.Lawrence's version, from her 1973 album of the same name, went to number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart after its release.Of several cover versions, the one recorded by Reba McEntire for her 1991 album For My Broken Heart peaked at number 12 on the Hot Country Songs chart..The unnamed female narrator tells about how her unnamed brother was hanged for a crime he didn't actually commit (although he had intended to do it): Returning home from a two-week trip to a place called Candletop, a man identified only as \"Brother\" stops for a drink at Webb's Bar before going home to his wife.While at the bar, he encounters his friend Andy Wolloe, who informs him that while he was gone his bride/wife was having an affair with \"that Amos boy, Seth\", and then admits that he himself had been with her as well.A now-angry Brother abruptly leaves the bar, and a frightened Andy makes his way home..Assuming his absent wife has left town, Brother goes home and finds the only thing his father had left him, a gun.Brother then makes his way through the backwoods to Andy's house.On the way there, he notices a set of footprints leading to and from the house, but they are not big enough to have been made by Andy.Arriving at his back door, the man finds Andy inside lying dead on the floor from a gunshot.In a panic, Brother fires a shot in the air to get the attention of the police, only to find himself arrested for Andy's murder.In a show trial, the judge wastes little time declaring Brother guilty and sentences him to death by hanging, which is carried out in short order..", "Return address": "In postal mail, a return address is an explicit inclusion of the address of the person sending the message.It provides the recipient (and sometimes authorized intermediaries) with a means to determine how to respond to the sender of the message if needed..The return address should include an address or P.O.box details in the same way as the delivery address should.In countries like the United States, the return address is located in the upper left-hand corner of the envelope, card, or label.[1] In the United Kingdom, the return address is usually placed on the reverse of the envelope, after the words \"Return address\".[2].Businesses often use envelopes preprinted with a return address.Many individuals have sheets of adhesive labels preprinted with their home address to affix to their correspondence.Charities sometimes include such sheets in mailshots.Rolls of return address labels can be purchased from companies that sell personalized labels to provide individuals an easy way to peel and stick return address labels to their envelopes..The return address is not required on postal mail.However, lack of a return address prevents the postal service from being able to return the item if it proves undeliverable; such as from damage, postage due, or invalid destination.Such mail may otherwise become dead letter mail.[3].", "Nerve guidance conduit": "A nerve guidance conduit (also referred to as an artificial nerve conduit or artificial nerve graft, as opposed to an autograft) is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate nerve regeneration and is one of several clinical treatments for nerve injuries.When direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve cannot be accomplished without tension, the standard clinical treatment for peripheral nerve injuries is autologous nerve grafting.Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting, neural tissue engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment, especially for large defects.Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the central nervous system poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment.[1].The creation of artificial conduits is also known as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap are enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materials.[2] Whether the conduit is in the form of a biologic tube, synthetic tube or tissue-engineered conduit, it should facilitate neurotropic and neurotrophic communication between the proximal and distal ends of the nerve gap, block external inhibitory factors, and provide a physical guidance for axonal regrowth.[3] The most basic objective of a nerve guidance conduit is to combine physical, chemical, and biological cues under conditions that will foster tissue formation.[4].Materials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively.[5] Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements: scaffold structure, scaffold material, cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors and biomimetic materials.The choice of which physical, chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment, which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration.The factors that control material selection include biocompatibility, biodegradability,[6] mechanical integrity,[3] controllability during nerve growth, implantation and sterilization..In tissue engineering, the three main levels of scaffold structure are considered to be:.The superstructure of a conduit or scaffold is important for simulating in vivo conditions for nerve tissue formation.The extracellular matrix, which is mainly responsible for directing tissue growth and formation, has a complex superstructure created by many interwoven fibrous molecules.Ways of forming artificial superstructure include the use of thermo-responsive hydrogels, longitudinally oriented channels, longitudinally oriented fibers, stretch-grown axons, and nanofibrous scaffolds..", "Hardcore Pawn": "Hardcore Pawn is an American reality television series produced by RDF USA (later Zodiak Media) and Richard Dominick Productions for truTV about the day-to-day operations of American Jewelry and Loan, a family-owned and -operated pawn shop and broker in Detroit, Michigan's 8 Mile Road corridor.[1][2].The series premiered on August 16, 2010,[3] delivering two million viewers, setting a record as truTV's most-watched series premiere ever.[4] Production was halted and the show was canceled in 2014.[5].American Jewelry and Loan is owned by Les Gold, a third-generation pawnbroker and businessman, and the grandson of a pawnbroker who once owned Sam's Loans, a now-defunct pawnshop on Michigan Avenue in Detroit.[6] Les first opened American Jewelry at the Green Eight Shopping Center on 8 Mile Road in Oak Park in 1978, moving to its present location in 1993.[3].In 2011, American Jewelry expanded to its second location when it acquired Premier Jewelry and Loan in Pontiac;[7][a] the new location was featured in the first few episodes of Hardcore Pawn's fifth season,[10] and in two episodes of the sixth season, where Les's son and co-owner/employee Seth attempts to sell the Pontiac location behind Les's back.[11][12].Les' only son, Seth, is an alumnus of the University of Michigan and has been a co-owner of American Jewelry since graduating from school.Seth handles the store's marketing division and claims that if it was not for him, the shop's only marketing campaign would be \"an ad in the Yellow Pages\".[13] Les's daughter, Ashley, has a bachelor's degree in business administration from Michigan State University and earned her graduate diamond certification from the Gemological Institute of America.Ashley is a co-owner of American Jewelry and has been working there for more than fifteen years, although she took three years off at one point for maternity leave.The sibling rivalry between her and Seth is a common element of many episodes.[14].During season 9, truTV decided not to order more episodes because of the network's new direction.truTV was concentrating on comedy programming and it was decided that Hardcore Pawn did not relate properly to other programs in the network's schedule.No other television networks showed interest in the series, and production was halted in 2014..The show averaged 2.6 million viewers during its sixth season.[15].", "Amoxicillin": "Amoxicillin is an antibiotic medication belonging to the aminopenicillin class of the penicillin family.The drug is used to treat bacterial infections[8] such as middle ear infection, strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, odontogenic infections, and urinary tract infections.[8] It is taken by mouth, or less commonly by injection.[8][9].Common adverse effects include nausea and rash.[8] It may also increase the risk of yeast infections and, when used in combination with clavulanic acid, diarrhea.[10] It should not be used in those who are allergic to penicillin.[8] While usable in those with kidney problems, the dose may need to be decreased.[8] Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding does not appear to be harmful.[8] Amoxicillin is in the \u03b2-lactam family of antibiotics.[8].Amoxicillin was discovered in 1958 and came into medical use in 1972.[11][12] Amoxil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1974,[4][5] and in the United Kingdom in 1977.[2] It is on the (WHO) World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[13][14] It is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in children.[15] Amoxicillin is available as a generic medication.[8]  In 2020, it was the 40th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15million prescriptions.[16][17].Amoxicillin is used in the treatment of a number of infections, including acute otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, skin infections, urinary tract infections, Salmonella infections, Lyme disease, and chlamydia infections.[8][18].Children with acute otitis media who are younger than six months of age are generally treated with amoxicillin or other antibiotics.Although most children with acute otitis media who are older than two years old do not benefit from treatment with amoxicillin or other antibiotics, such treatment may be helpful in children younger than two years old with acute otitis media that is bilateral or accompanied by ear drainage.[19] In the past, amoxicillin was dosed three times daily when used to treat acute otitis media, which resulted in missed doses in routine ambulatory practice.There is now evidence that two times daily dosing or once daily dosing has similar effectiveness.[20].Most sinusitis infections are caused by viruses, for which amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are ineffective,[21] and the small benefit gained by amoxicillin may be overridden by the adverse effects.[22].Amoxicillin is considered the first-line empirical treatment for most cases of uncomplicated bacterial sinusitis in children and adults when culture data is unavailable.[23][24][25] Amoxicillin is recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in adults by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, either alone (mild to moderate severity disease) or in combination with a macrolide.[26] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends amoxicillin as first-line treatment for pneumonia that is not \"severe\".[27] Amoxicillin is used in post-exposure inhalation of anthrax to prevent disease progression and for prophylaxis.[18].It is effective as one part of a multi-drug regimen for treatment of stomach infections of Helicobacter pylori.It is typically combined with a proton-pump inhibitor (such as omeprazole) and a macrolide antibiotic (such as clarithromycin); other drug combinations are also effective.[28].", "List of The Big Bang Theory characters": "The American television sitcom The Big Bang Theory, created and executive produced by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007, while the American comedy spin-off prequel television series Young Sheldon, created and executive produced by Lorre alongside Jim Parsons and Steven Molaro, premiered on CBS on September 25, 2017..The Big Bang Theory initially centers on five characters: Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Lee Cooper, two physicists and roommates; Penny, their neighbor who is a waitress and aspiring actress; and Leonard and Sheldon's friends and coworkers aerospace engineer Howard Joel Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali..Over time, several supporting characters have been introduced and promoted to starring roles, including physicist Leslie Winkle, neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler, microbiologist Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz, comic book store proprietor and friend of the other characters Stuart Bloom.The series also features numerous supporting characters, each of whom plays a prominent role in a story arc.Included among them are parents of the main characters, their dates and their coworkers.Celebrities such as Stephen Hawking appear in cameo roles as themselves..Young Sheldon initially centers on Sheldon Cooper at the age of nine, going to high school and living with his family in the fictional town of Medford, East Texas, Sheldon's mother, Mary; his father and the head football coach at Medford High, George Sr.; his twin sister, Missy; his older brother, George Jr.; and his grandmother, Constance \"Connie\"

classmates, their dates and coworkers, and those of his family.Celebrities such as Elon Musk appear in cameo roles as themselves.Jim Parsons, who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, narrates the series and serves as an executive producer..This section includes characters who have appeared in The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon series with main role..", "Human evolution": "Human evolution is the evolutionary process within the history of primates that led to the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of the hominid family, which includes all the great apes.This process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism, dexterity and complex language,[1] as well as interbreeding with other hominins (a tribe of the African hominid subfamily),[2] indicating that human evolution was not linear but weblike.[3][4][5][6] The study of human evolution involves several scientific disciplines, including physical and evolutionary anthropology, paleontology, and genetics.[7][8].Primates diverged from other mammals about 85million years ago (mya), in the Late Cretaceous period, with their earliest fossils appearing over 55mya, during the Paleocene.[9] Primates produced successive clades leading to the ape superfamily, which gave rise to the hominid and the gibbon families; these diverged some 15\u201320mya.African and Asian hominids (including orangutans) diverged about 14mya.Hominins (including the Australopithecine and Panina subtribes) parted from the Gorillini tribe (gorillas) between 8\u20139mya; Australopithecine (including the extinct biped ancestors of humans) separated from the Pan genus (containing chimpanzees and bonobos) 4\u20137mya.[10] The Homo genus is evidenced by the appearance of H.habilis over 2mya,[a] while anatomically modern humans emerged in Africa approximately 300,000 years ago..The evolutionary history of primates can be traced back 65million years.[11][12][13][14][15] One of the oldest known primate-like mammal species, the Plesiadapis, came from North America;[16][17][18][19][20][21] another, Archicebus, came from China.[22] Other similar basal primates were widespread in Eurasia and Africa during the tropical conditions of the Paleocene and Eocene..David R.Begun[23] concluded that early primates flourished in Eurasia and that a lineage leading to the African apes and humans, including to Dryopithecus, migrated south from Europe or Western Asia into Africa.The surviving tropical population of primates\u2014which is seen most completely in the Upper Eocene and lowermost Oligocene fossil beds of the Faiyum depression southwest of Cairo\u2014gave rise to all extant primate species, including the lemurs of Madagascar, lorises of Southeast Asia, galagos or \"bush babies\" of Africa, and to the anthropoids, which are the Platyrrhines or New World monkeys, the Catarrhines or Old World monkeys, and the great apes, including humans and other hominids..The earliest known catarrhine is Kamoyapithecus from the uppermost Oligocene at Eragaleit in the northern Great Rift Valley in Kenya, dated to 24million years ago.[24] Its ancestry is thought to be species related to Aegyptopithecus, Propliopithecus, and Parapithecus from the Faiyum, at around 35mya.[25] In 2010, Saadanius was described as a close relative of the last common ancestor of the crown catarrhines, and tentatively dated to 29\u201328mya, helping to fill an 11-million-year gap in the fossil record.[26].In the Early Miocene, about 22million years ago, the many kinds of arboreally adapted primitive catarrhines from East Africa suggest a long history of prior diversification.Fossils at 20million years ago include fragments attributed to Victoriapithecus, the earliest Old World monkey.", "Lisa Cuddy": "Lisa Cuddy, M.D., is a fictional character on the Fox medical drama House.She is portrayed by Lisa Edelstein.Cuddy was the dean of medicine of the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey.Cuddy quit her job after the events of season seven's finale \"Moving On\"..Cuddy's job title in House is Dean of Medicine and Hospital Administrator.[1] She is Jewish,[2] and has a mother and one sister; her father is dead.[3] She began dreaming of becoming a doctor when she was 12, graduated from medical school at age 25 as second best in her class, and became the first female and second youngest Dean of Medicine at the age of 32 (she was actually 29 but she added three years to her age in order to seem more mature to the Selection Committee).[4] Cuddy attended the University of Michigan, where she first met Gregory House (Hugh Laurie),[4] and with whom she shared a one-night stand.[5].After hiring House to run the hospital's Diagnostics Department, Cuddy began setting aside $50,000 a year from the hospital's budget for potential legal expenses.[6] When, during Season 1, the new Chairman of the Board Edward Vogler (Chi McBride) tries to have House fired for refusing to kowtow to his demands, Cuddy urges the board to save House and remove Vogler instead, losing the $100 million donation he had made to the hospital.[7] In Season 2, it is revealed that Cuddy is trying to conceive a child.[8] House agrees to administer the twice-daily injections necessary for her to undergo in-vitro fertilization and to keep the matter secret.[9] In Season 3, Cuddy confesses to the hospital's Head of Oncology and House's best friend Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) that she has made a total of three attempts at impregnation, one of which was miscarried.She is hurt when House, who was going through Vicodin withdrawal, tells her it is a good thing she has failed to become a mother, as she would suck at it.[10] When House's career is threatened by Detective Michael Tritter (David Morse), Cuddy falsifies documents and perjures herself in court to cover up his wrongdoing.[1].Cuddy questions whether House has a romantic interest in her when he interrupts her repeatedly during a blind date.[11] When Wilson takes Cuddy to the theatre[12] and later to an art exhibition, House intervenes in an attempt to prevent Cuddy from becoming Wilson's fourth wife.[13] In Season 5, Cuddy reveals that she is adopting a baby girl, to be named Joy,[14] and then is devastated when the birth-mother decides to keep the baby.House consoles her, and the two share a passionate kiss.[15] Cuddy professes not to want a relationship with House but is touched when he has her old desk from medical school brought out of storage for her when her office is renovated.[16] In episode \"Joy to the World\", Cuddy becomes a foster mother and potential adoptive mother to a baby girl she names Rachel.[17] She initially struggles with motherhood, revealing to Wilson that she feels nothing for Rachel but soon begins to bond with her.[18] In episode \"Under My Skin\", Cuddy helps House detox from Vicodin; and the two sleep together.[19] In the following episode, the Season 5 finale \"Both Sides Now\", this is revealed to have been a hallucination on House's part: in reality, he spent the evening alone and is suffering from psychiatric problems as a result of Vicodin and emotional trauma.[20].Throughout Season 6, Cuddy is busy with her adopted daughter and is in a relationship with a private investigator, Lucas, who was hired by House to spy on Wilson at the start of Season 5.She cared for House after he goes through rehab for Vicodin.After sensing romantic feelings from House, Cuddy tells House that she would like to be friends; but he refuses, quoting that is the \"last thing he wants\".", "Track and field": "Track and field is a sport that includes athletic contests based on running, jumping, and throwing skills.[1] The name is derived from where the sport takes place, a running track and a grass field for the throwing and some of the jumping events.Track and field is categorized under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running and racewalking..The foot racing events, which include sprints, middle- and long-distance events, racewalking, and hurdling, are won by the athlete who completes it in the least time.The jumping and throwing events are won by those who achieve the greatest distance or height.Regular jumping events include long jump, triple jump, high jump, and pole vault, while the most common throwing events are shot put, javelin, discus, and hammer.There are also \"combined events\" or \"multi events\", such as the pentathlon consisting of five events, heptathlon consisting of seven events, and decathlon consisting of ten events.In these, athletes participate in a combination of track and field events.Most track and field events are individual sports with a single victor; the most prominent team events are relay races, which typically feature teams of four.Events are almost exclusively divided by gender, although both the men's and women's competitions are usually held at the same venue.Recently, \"mixed\" relay events have been introduced into meets, whereby two men and two women make up the four-person team.If a race has too many people to run all at once, preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants..Track and field is one of the oldest sports.", "Gulf War":

Gulf War was an armed conflict between Iraq and a 42-country coalition led by the United States.The coalition's efforts against Iraq were carried out in two key phases: Operation Desert Shield, which marked the military buildup from August 1990 to January 1991; and Operation Desert Storm, which began with the aerial bombing campaign against Iraq on 17 January 1991 and came to a close with the American-led Liberation of Kuwait on 28 February 1991..On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait,[28] and had fully occupied the country within two days.Initially, Iraq ran the occupied territory under a puppet government known as the \"Republic of Kuwait\" before proceeding with an outright annexation in which Kuwaiti sovereign territory was split, with the \"Saddamiyat al-Mitla' District\" being carved out of the country's northern portion and the \"Kuwait Governorate\" covering the rest.", "Nickel (United States coin)": "A nickel, sometimes mistakenly called a nickle, is a five-cent coin struck by the United States Mint.Composed of cupronickel (75%copper and 25%nickel), the piece has been issued since 1866.Its diameter is 0.835 inches (21.21mm) and its thickness is 0.077 inches (1.95mm)..The silver half dime, equal to five cents, was issued from 1792 to 1873 before today's cupronickel version.The American Civil War caused economic hardship, driving gold and silver from circulation; in response, in place of low-value coins, the government at first issued paper currency.In 1865, Congress abolished the five-cent fractional currency note after Spencer M.Clark, head of the Currency Bureau (today the Bureau of Engraving and Printing), placed his own portrait on the denomination.After the successful introduction of two-cent and three-cent pieces without precious metal, Congress also authorized a five-cent piece consisting of base metal; the Mint began striking this version in 1866.The initial design of the Shield nickel was struck from 1866 until 1883, then was replaced by the Liberty Head nickel.The Buffalo nickel was introduced in 1913 as part of a drive to increase the beauty of American coinage..The nickel is minted in its modern form as the Jefferson nickel, which was first introduced in 1938.In 2004 and 2005, special Jefferson nickel designs in honor of the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition were issued.", "Flower": "A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae).Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants consist of a few haploid cells that produce gametes.The \"male\" gametophyte, which produces non-motile sperm, is enclosed within pollen grains; the \"female\" gametophyte is contained within the ovule.When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination.Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from the same flower or a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species..Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma.This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[1].Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy).Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop..Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.[2] In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one another\u2014in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.[3] After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds..Flowers have long been appreciated by humans for their beauty and pleasant scents, and also hold cultural significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic objects, or sources of medicine and food..Flower is from the Middle English flour, which referred to both the ground grain and the reproductive structure in plants, before splitting off in the 17th century.", "McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle": "The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is an American twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft designed by McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing).Following reviews of proposals, the United States Air Force (USAF) selected McDonnell Douglas's design in 1969 to meet the service's need for a dedicated air superiority fighter.The Eagle first flew in July 1972, and entered service in 1976.It is among the most successful modern fighters, with over 100 victories and no losses in aerial combat, with the majority of the kills by the Israeli Air Force.[3][4].The Eagle has been exported to many countries including Israel, Japan, and Saudi Arabia.Although the F-15 was originally envisioned as a pure air-superiority aircraft, its design included a secondary ground-attack capability that was largely unused.[5] It proved flexible enough that an improved all-weather strike derivative, the F-15E Strike Eagle, was later developed, entered service in 1989 and has been exported to several nations.Several additional F-15 variants have been produced..The USAF had planned to replace all of its air superiority F-15s with the Lockheed Martin F-22 by the 2010s, but the severely reduced F-22 procurement forced the USAF to operate the F-15C/D into the 2020s.The F-15E Strike Eagle is expected to continue operating in the USAF into the 2030s.The F-15 is in service with numerous countries, with production of enhanced variants continuing..The F-15 can trace its origins to the early Vietnam War, when the U.S.Air Force and U.S.", "Mimio": "Mimio is a brand name of a line of technology products aimed at the education market.The primary products were originally focused around computer whiteboard interactive teaching devices.MimioCapture devices also allow users to capture all of the ink strokes that are written on the whiteboard.When used in conjunction with a video projector it turns the ordinary whiteboard surface into a fully interactive whiteboard.The product line has been dramatically expanded in the last two years as described in the \"Hardware Products\" and \"Software Products\" sections below..The product line was originally designed by Virtual Ink.On October 4, 2006 Newell Rubbermaid acquired the Mimio interactive whiteboard (iWB) product line.On July 15, 2013, SkyView Capital acquired the Mimio hardware and software product lines.[1].The first Mimio was introduced in 1997..In November 2008, a Graphics tablet called Mimio Pad was launched under the Mimio brand.It comes with the most popular Mimio studio functions pre-programmed for ease of use.It uses 2.4GHz wireless technology and has a range of 12m..", "Rahab": "Rahab (/\u02c8re\u026ah\u00e6b/;[1] Hebrew: \u05e8\u05b8\u05d7\u05b8\u05d1\u200e, Modern:Ra\u1e96av, Tiberian:R\u0101\u1e25\u0101\u1e07, \"broad\", \"large\", Arabic: \u0631\u062d\u0627\u0628, a vast space of a land) was, according to the Book of Joshua, a Gentile woman who lived in Jericho in the Promised Land and assisted the Israelites by hiding two men who had been sent to scout the city prior to their attack.[2] In the New Testament, she is lauded both as an example of a saint who lived by faith,[3] and as someone \"considered righteous\" for her works.[4] According to bibical research, the author intended that she did not actually contribute in conquering the city, but rather saved herself and her family from death by the Isralites forces.[5][6].The King James Version renders the name as Rachab, after its literal spelling in Greek, which differs from the spelling for Rahab in James and Hebrews.Most modern versions render it as Rahab ignoring the distinction.[7].The Hebrew \u05d0\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 (ishah zonah), used to describe Rahab in Joshua 2:1, literally means \"a prostitute woman\".[8] While the Talmud holds to that interpetation, some sources in Rabbanic litreature insists that she was an \"innkeeper,\" based on Targum Jonathan and other texts (Jewish Babylonian Aramaic: \u05e4\u05bb\u05e0\u05d3\u05b0\u05e7\u05b5\u05d9\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0, romanized:pund\u01ddqe\u1e6f\u0101[9]).Rahab's name is presumably the shortened form of a sentence name r\u0101\u1e25\u0101b-N, \"the god N has opened/widened (the womb?)\".[10] The Hebrew z\u014dn\u00e2 may refer to secular or cultic prostitution, and the latter is widely believed to have been an invariable element of Canaanite religion, although recent scholarship has disputed this.[8] However, there was a separate word, q\u01ddd\u0113\u0161\u00e2, that could be used to designate ritual prostitutes.[8].Josephus mentions that Rahab kept an inn but is silent as to whether merely renting out rooms was her only source of income.[11] It was not uncommon for both an inn and a brothel to operate within the same building; thus entering Rahab's quarters was not necessarily a deviation from Joshua's orders.Indeed, as Robert Boling notes, such an establishment might have represented an ideal location for spies to gather intelligence.[8] A number of scholars have noted that the narrator in Joshua 2 may have intended to remind the readers of the \"immemorial symbiosis between military service and bawdy house\".[8].In the Christian New Testament, the Epistle of James and the Epistle to the Hebrews follow the tradition set by the translators of the Septuagint in using the Greek word \"\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\" (p\u00f3rn\u0113, which is usually translated to English as \"harlot\" or \"prostitute\") to describe Rahab.[12][13][14].William L.Lyons observed that biblical interpreters have viewed Rahab as a model of hospitality, mercy, faith, patience, and repentance in her interaction with Joshua's spies.Thus the harlot of Jericho became a paragon of virtue.[15].According to the book of Joshua,[16] when the Hebrews were encamped at Shittim in the Arabah or Jordan Valley opposite Jericho, ready to cross the river, Joshua, as a final preparation, sent out two spies to investigate the military strength of Jericho.", "Organization of American States": "The Organization of American States (OAS or OEA; Spanish: Organizaci\u00f3n de los Estados Americanos; Portuguese: Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos Estados Americanos; French: Organisation des \u00c9tats am\u00e9ricains;) is an international organization founded on 30 April 1948 to promote cooperation among its member states within the Americas..Headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States, the OAS is a \"multilateral regional body focused on human rights, electoral oversight, social and economic development, and security in the Western Hemisphere\", according to the Council on Foreign Relations.[2] As of June 2023, 35 states in the Americas are OAS members.[3][4].Luis Almagro of Uruguay was inaugurated as OAS secretary general in 2015.[5][6].The notion of an international union in the New World was first put forward during the liberation of the Americas by Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar[7] who, at the 1826 Congress of Panama (still being part of Colombia), proposed creating a league of American republics, with a common military, a mutual defense pact, and a supranational parliamentary assembly.This meeting was attended by representatives of Gran Colombia (comprising the modern-day countries of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Venezuela), Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, The United Provinces of Central America, and Mexico but the grandly titled \"Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation\" was ultimately ratified only by Gran Colombia.Bol\u00edvar's dream soon floundered with civil war in Gran Colombia, the disintegration of Central America, and the emergence of national rather than New World outlooks in the newly independent American republics.Bol\u00edvar's dream of inter-American unity was meant to unify Hispanic American nations against external powers..The pursuit of regional solidarity and cooperation again came to the forefront in 1889\u20131890, at the First International Conference of American States.Gathered together in Washington, D.C., 18 nations resolved to found the International Union of American Republics, served by a permanent secretariat called the Commercial Bureau of the American Republics (renamed the International Commercial Bureau at the Second International Conference in 1901\u20131902).These two bodies, in existence as of 14 April 1890, represent the point of inception to which the OAS and its General Secretariat trace their origins..At the fourth International Conference of American States (Buenos Aires, 1910), the name of the organization was changed to the Union of American Republics and the Bureau became the Pan American Union.The Pan American Union Building was constructed in 1910, on Constitution Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D.C..", "Christopher Columbus": "Christopher Columbus[b] (/k\u0259\u02c8l\u028cmb\u0259s/;[2] between 25 August and 31 October 1451 \u2013 20 May 1506) was an Italian[c] explorer and navigator from the Republic of Genoa who completed four Spanish-based voyages across the Atlantic Ocean sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs, opening the way for the widespread European exploration and European colonization of the Americas.His expeditions were the first known European contact with the Caribbean and Central and South America..The name Christopher Columbus is the anglicisation of the Latin Christophorus Columbus.Growing up on the coast of Liguria, he went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far north as the British Isles and as far south as what is now Ghana.He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo, who bore a son Diego, and was based in Lisbon for several years.He later took a Castilian mistress, Beatriz Enr\u00edquez de Arana, who bore a son, Ferdinand.[4][5][6].Largely self-educated, Columbus was knowledgeable in geography, astronomy, and history.He developed a plan to seek a western sea passage to the East Indies, hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade.After the Granada War, and Columbus's persistent lobbying in multiple kingdoms, the Catholic Monarchs, Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand II agreed to sponsor a journey west.Columbus left Castile in August 1492 with three ships and made landfall in the Americas on 12 October, ending the period of human habitation in the Americas now referred to as the pre-Columbian era.His landing place was an island in the Bahamas, known by its native inhabitants as Guanahani.He then visited the islands now known as Cuba and Hispaniola, establishing a colony in what is now Haiti.", "Boxer (dog)": "The Boxer is a medium to large, short-haired dog breed of mastiff-type, developed in Germany.The coat is smooth and tight-fitting; colors are fawn, brindled, or white, with or without white markings.Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey.The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed.The Boxer is a member of both The Kennel Club and American Kennel Club (AKC) Working Group.[4].The first Boxer club was founded in 1895, with Boxers being first exhibited in a dog show for St.Bernards in Munich the next year.Based on 2013 AKC statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh-most popular breed of dog in the United States for the fourth consecutive year.[5] According to the AKC's website,[6] though, the boxer is now the 11th-most popular dog breed in the United States..The head is the most distinctive feature of the Boxer.The breed standard dictates that it must be in perfect proportion to the body and above all it must never be too light.[7] The greatest value is to be placed on the muzzle being of correct form and in absolute proportion to the skull.The length of the muzzle to the whole of the head should be a ratio of 1:3.Folds are always present from the root of the nose running downwards on both sides of the muzzle, and the tip of the nose should lie somewhat higher than the root of the muzzle.", "Serial ATA": "SATA (Serial AT Attachment)[a][2] is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives.Serial ATA succeeded the earlier Parallel ATA (PATA) standard to become the predominant interface for storage devices..Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO) which are then released by the INCITS Technical Committee T13, AT Attachment (INCITS T13).[3].SATA was announced in 2000[4][5] in order to provide several advantages over the earlier PATA interface such as reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40 or 80), native hot swapping, faster data transfer through higher signaling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) I/O queuing protocol.Revision 1.0 of the specification was released in January 2003.[2].Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO).The SATA-IO group collaboratively creates, reviews, ratifies, and publishes the interoperability specifications, the test cases and plugfests.As with many other industry compatibility standards, the SATA content ownership is transferred to other industry bodies: primarily INCITS T13[3] and an INCITS T10 subcommittee (SCSI), a subgroup of T10 responsible for Serial Attached SCSI (SAS).The remainder of this article strives to use the SATA-IO terminology and specifications..Before SATA's introduction in 2000, PATA was simply known as ATA.The \"AT Attachment\" (ATA) name originated after the 1984 release of the IBM Personal Computer AT, more commonly known as the IBM AT.[6] The IBM AT's controller interface became a de facto industry interface for the inclusion of hard disks.\"AT\" was IBM's abbreviation for \"Advanced Technology\"; thus, many companies and organizations indicate SATA is an abbreviation of \"Serial Advanced Technology Attachment\".", "History of the Internet": "The history of the Internet has its origin in the efforts of scientists and engineers to build and interconnect computer networks.The Internet Protocol Suite, the set of rules used to communicate between networks and devices on the Internet, arose from research and development in the United States and involved international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the United Kingdom and France.[1][2][3][4].Computer science was an emerging discipline in the late 1950s that began to consider time-sharing between computer users, and later, the possibility of achieving this over wide area networks.J.C.R.Licklider developed the idea of a universal network at the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).Independently, Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation proposed a distributed network based on data in message blocks in the early 1960s, and Donald Davies conceived of packet switching in 1965 at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), proposing a national commercial data network in the United Kingdom..ARPA awarded contracts in 1969 for the development of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor and managed by Lawrence Roberts.ARPANET adopted the packet switching technology proposed by Davies and Baran, underpinned by mathematical work in the early 1970s by Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA.The network was built by a team at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, which included Bob Kahn..Several early packet-switched networks emerged in the 1970s which researched and provided data networking.", "The Gift (Susan Boyle album)": "The Gift is the second album and first Christmas album by Scottish singer Susan Boyle, which was released on 8 November 2010.[3] Boyle hinted that the album has a 1960s feel \"because that was [her] era\".[4][5] Despite having a mixed critical reception, the album debuted at number one on both the British and American album charts and received a nomination at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album..It was produced by Steve Mac, who says, \"Now Susan\u2019s used to the studio and the recording process, this time round we might go even further down a traditional route of recording by getting a band together and rehearsing songs before we go into the studio to see what works, how she reacts with certain parts, and so we can change the arrangements that way.I think that\u2019s going to work much better...With Susan it's very important she connects with the public and the public connect with her.She doesn\u2019t want to sing anything that hasn\u2019t happened to her or she can't relate to.\"[2].In a lead up to the release, Boyle offered her fans a chance to duet with her, with a competition titled Susan's Search.Applicants had to record a video of themselves singing \"Silent Night\" and upload it to her YouTube channel.[6] The winner was 33-year-old paramedic Amber Stassi of Brewerton, New York.[7].The album has received generally lukewarm reviews from critics.[8] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album two and a half out of five stars, complimenting Boyle as the right person to make a holiday album, but referred to the music as \"predictable\".[9] Graham Rockingham of Metro International gave the album mixed reviews, criticising how the album can be a number 1 charter, but at the same time be well suited for traditional carols..In the UK, The Gift debuted at No.1.However, it remained at the top spot for only one week and dropped out of the chart altogether after eleven weeks.[13] In comparison, Boyle's first album topped the UK chart for four weeks and remained on the chart for 39 weeks..In the United States, The Gift debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart with first week sales of 318,000 copies.[14] In its second week, the album stayed at No.", "This Is Just To Say": "\"This Is Just to Say\" (1934) is an imagist poem[1] by William Carlos Williams.The three-versed, 28-word poem is an apology about eating the reader's plums.The poem was written as if it was a note left on a kitchen table.It has been widely parodied.[2][3].I have eaten.the plums.that were in.the icebox.and which.you were probably.saving.for breakfast.", "Albus Dumbledore": "Prof.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore[1]  is a fictional character in J.K.Rowling's Harry Potter series.For most of the series, he is the headmaster of the wizarding school Hogwarts.As part of his backstory, it is revealed that he is the founder and leader of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort, the main antagonist of the series..Dumbledore was portrayed by Richard Harris in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002).Following Harris' death in October 2002, Michael Gambon portrayed Dumbledore in the six remaining Harry Potter films from 2004 to 2011.Jude Law portrayed Dumbledore as a middle-aged man in the prequel films Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018) and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore (2022).[2].Rowling stated she chose the name Dumbledore, which is a dialectal word for \"bumblebee\",[3] because of Dumbledore's love of music: she imagined him walking around \"humming to himself a lot\".[4].Rowling said she enjoyed writing Dumbledore because he \"is the epitome of goodness.\"[5] She said that Dumbledore speaks for her, as he \"knows pretty much everything\" about the Harry Potter universe.[6] Rowling mentioned that Dumbledore regrets \"that he has always had to be the one who knew, and who had the burden of knowing.And he would rather not know.\"[7] As a mentor to the central character Harry Potter, \"Dumbledore is a very wise man who knows that Harry is going to have to learn a few hard lessons to prepare him for what may be coming in his life.", "Calcitonin": "Calcitonin is a 32 amino acid peptide hormone secreted by parafollicular cells (also known as C cells) of the thyroid (or endostyle) in humans and other chordates[3] in the ultimopharyngeal body.[4] It acts to reduce blood calcium (Ca2+), opposing the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH).[5].Its importance in humans has not been as well established as its importance in other animals, as its function is usually not significant in the regulation of normal calcium homeostasis.[6] It belongs to the calcitonin-like protein family..Historically calcitonin has also been called thyrocalcitonin.[7].Calcitonin is formed by the proteolytic cleavage of a larger prepropeptide, which is the product of the CALC1 gene (CALCA).It is functionally an antagonist with PTH and Vitamin D3.The CALC1 gene belongs to a superfamily of related protein hormone precursors including islet amyloid precursor protein, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and the precursor of adrenomedullin..Secretion of calcitonin is stimulated by:.The hormone participates in calcium (Ca2+) metabolism.In many ways, calcitonin counteracts parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D..More specifically, calcitonin lowers blood Ca2+ levels in two ways:.High concentrations of calcitonin may be able to increase urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate via the renal tubules.[13] leading to marked hypocalcemia.However, this is a minor effect with no physiological significance in humans.", "Mousepad": "A mousepad or mousemat is a surface for placing and moving a computer mouse.A mousepad enhances the usability of the mouse compared to using a mouse directly on a table by providing a surface to allow it to measure movement accurately and without jitter.Some mousepads increase ergonomics by providing a padded wrist rest..During a 1968 presentation by Douglas Engelbart marking the public debut of a mouse,[1].Engelbart used a control console designed by Jack Kelley of Herman Miller that included a keyboard and an inset portion used as a support area for the mouse.[1][2].According to Kelley[3].and also stated by Alex Pang,[4] Kelley designed the first mousepad a year later, in 1969..Details of a mousepad designed by Armando M.Fernandez were published in the Xerox Disclosure Journal in 1979 with the description:[5].CRT Cursor Control Mechanism Pad.To assist the operation of a cathode ray tube pointer 10 wherein a metal ball is rolled on a hard surface, the disclosed pad may be utilized.A resilient, rubber-like material 12 is bonded or otherwise attached to a hard base material 14 which keeps the rubber-like material flat.", "Riverfront Stadium": "Riverfront Stadium, also known as Cinergy Field from 1996 to 2002, was a multi-purpose stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio.It was the home of the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1970 through 2002 and the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL) from 1970 to 1999.Located on the Ohio River in downtown Cincinnati, the stadium was best known as the home of \"The Big Red Machine\", as the Reds were often called in the 1970s..Construction began on February 1, 1968, and was completed at a cost of less than $50 million.Riverfront's grand opening was held on June 30, 1970, an 8\u20132 Reds loss to the Atlanta Braves.Braves right fielder Hank Aaron hit the first home run in Riverfront's history, a two-run shot in the first inning which also served as the stadium's first runs batted in.[3] Two weeks later on July 14, 1970, Riverfront hosted the 1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.This game is best remembered for the often-replayed collision at home plate between Reds star Pete Rose and catcher Ray Fosse of the Cleveland Indians..In September 1996, Riverfront Stadium was renamed \"Cinergy Field\" in a sponsorship deal with Greater Cincinnati energy company Cinergy.In 2001, to make room for Great American Ball Park, the seating capacity at Cinergy Field was reduced to 39,000.There was a huge in-play wall in center field visible after the renovations, to serve as the batter's eye.The stadium was demolished by implosion on December 29, 2002..Riverfront was a multi-purpose, circular \"cookie-cutter\" stadium, one of many built in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s as communities sought to save money by having their football and baseball teams share the same facility.", "Nexen Tire": "Nexen Tire Corporation (Korean: \ub125\uc13c\ud0c0\uc774\uc5b4) is a tire manufacturer headquartered in Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province and Seoul in South Korea.It was established in 1942 under the name Heung-A Tire Company..In 1985, Nexen dedicated a facility in Yangsan, Korea, to the production of radial tires..The company changed their name in 2000 from Woosung Tire to Nexen Tire Corporation.That same year also saw Nexen Tire listed on the KOSPI 200 Index future market..In 2005, Nexen Tire was awarded a patent for the technology to manufacture rubber/stratified silicate nano-composite tires.By 2006, they had completed development on the new UHP and Winter LTR/SUV pattern.To accommodate increased demand, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Qingdao, China in 2007.Nexen's domestic market share increased from 8% to 20%, with annual sales exceeding $600 million.The company employs over 2,000 and currently exports to 120 countries.[2] Its major Korean competitors are Hankook and Kumho..The company's name, a portmanteau of next and century is reflected in its marketing tagline, \"Next Century Tire.\".N2000, N3000,

"Silent majority": "The silent majority is an unspecified large group of people in a country or group who do not express their opinions publicly.[1] The term was popularized by U.S.President Richard Nixon in a televised address on November 3, 1969, in which he said, \"And so tonight\u2014to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans\u2014I ask for your support.\"[2][3] In this usage it referred to those Americans who did not join in the large demonstrations against the Vietnam War at the time, who did not join in the counterculture, and who did not participate in public discourse.Nixon, along with many others, saw this group of Middle Americans as being overshadowed in the media by the more vocal minority..Preceding Nixon by half a century, it was employed in 1919 by Calvin Coolidge's campaign for the 1920 presidential nomination.Before that, the phrase was used in the 19th century as a euphemism referring to all the people who have died, and others have used it before and after Nixon to refer to groups of voters in various nations of the world..'The majority' or 'the silent majority' can be traced back to the Roman writer Petronius, who wrote abiit ad plures (he is gone to the majority) to describe deceased people, since the dead outnumber the living.[4] (In 2023 there were approximately 14.6 dead for every living person.[5][6]).The phrase was used for much of the 19th century to refer to the dead.Phrases such as \"gone to a better world\", \"gone before\", and \"joined the silent majority\" served as euphemisms for \"died\".[7] In 1902, Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan employed this sense of the phrase, saying in a speech that \"great captains on both sides of our Civil War have long ago passed over to the silent majority, leaving the memory of their splendid courage.\"[8].In May 1831, the expression \"silent majority\" was spoken by Churchill C.Cambreleng, representative of New York state, before 400 members of the Tammany Society.[9] Cambreleng complained to his audience about a U.S federal bill that had been rejected without full examination by the United States House of Representatives.Cambreleng's \"silent majority\" referred to other representatives who voted as a bloc:.Whenever majorities trample upon the rights of minorities\u2014when men are denied even the privilege of having their causes of complaint examined into\u2014when measures, which they deem for their relief, are rejected by the despotism of a silent majority at a second reading\u2014when such become the rules of our legislation, the Congress of this Union will no longer justly represent a republican people.[9].", "Monkeys in space": "Before humans went into space in the 1960s, several other animals were launched into space, including numerous other primates, so that scientists could investigate the biological effects of spaceflight.The United States launched flights containing primate passengers primarily between 1948 and 1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985.France launched two monkey-carrying flights in 1967.The Soviet Union and Russia launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996.Most primates were anesthetized before lift-off..Overall, thirty-two non-human primates flew in the space program; none flew more than once.Numerous backup primates also went through the programs but never flew.Monkeys and non-human apes from several species were used, including rhesus macaque, crab-eating macaque, squirrel monkeys, pig-tailed macaques, and chimpanzees..The first primate launched into high subspace, although not a space flight, was Albert I, a rhesus macaque, who on June 18, 1948, rode a rocket flight to over 63km (39mi) in Earth's atmosphere on a V-2 rocket.Albert I died of suffocation during the flight and may actually have died in the cramped space capsule before launch.[1][2][3].On June 14, 1949, Albert II survived a sub-orbital V-2 flight into space (but died on impact after a parachute failure)[2] to become the first monkey, first primate, and first mammal in space.His flight reached 134km (83mi) \u2013 past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line of 100km which designates the beginning of space.[4].", "RAID": "RAID (/re\u026ad/; \"redundant array of inexpensive disks\"[1] or \"redundant array of independent disks\"[2]) is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both.This is in contrast to the previous concept of highly reliable mainframe disk drives referred to as \"single large expensive disk\" (SLED).[3][1].Data is distributed across the drives in one of several ways, referred to as RAID levels, depending on the required level of redundancy and performance.The different schemes, or data distribution layouts, are named by the word \"RAID\" followed by a number, for example RAID0 or RAID1.Each scheme, or RAID level, provides a different balance among the key goals: reliability, availability, performance, and capacity.RAID levels greater than RAID0 provide protection against unrecoverable sector read errors, as well as against failures of whole physical drives..The term \"RAID\" was invented by David Patterson, Garth A.Gibson, and Randy Katz at the University of California, Berkeley in 1987.In their June 1988 paper \"A Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)\", presented at the SIGMOD Conference, they argued that the top-performing mainframe disk drives of the time could be beaten on performance by an array of the inexpensive drives that had been developed for the growing personal computer market.Although failures would rise in proportion to the number of drives, by configuring for redundancy, the reliability of an array could far exceed that of any large single drive.[4].Although not yet using that terminology, the technologies of the five levels of RAID named in the June 1988 paper were used in various products prior to the paper's publication,[3] including the following:.Industry manufacturers later redefined the RAID acronym to stand for \"redundant array of independent disks\".[2][11][12][13].", "Lymphocyte": "A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell (leukocyte) in the immune system of most vertebrates.[1] Lymphocytes include T cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity), B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity),[2][3] and Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) (\"innate T cell-like\" cells involved in mucosal immunity and homeostasis), of which natural killer cells are an important subtype (which functions in cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity).They are the main type of cell found in lymph, which prompted the name \"lymphocyte\" (with cyte meaning cell).[4] Lymphocytes make up between 18% and 42% of circulating white blood cells.[2].The three major types of lymphocyte are T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells.[2] Lymphocytes can be identified by their large nucleus..T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow- or bursa-derived cells[a]) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response.T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies).The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific \"non-self\" antigens, during a process known as antigen presentation.Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored maximally to eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells.B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses.In response to pathogens some T cells, called T helper cells, produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called cytotoxic T cells, produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells.Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of memory cells.Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will \"remember\" each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired immunity..NK cells are a part of the innate immune system and play a major role in defending the host from tumors and virally infected cells.[2] NK cells modulate the functions of other cells, including macrophages and T cells,[2] and distinguish infected cells and tumors from normal and uninfected cells by recognizing changes of a surface molecule called MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I.", "The Big Lebowski": "The Big Lebowski (/l\u0259\u02c8ba\u028aski/) is a 1998 independent[5] crime comedy film written, produced, and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen.It stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, a Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler.He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, then learns that a millionaire, also named Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston), was the intended victim.The millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is supposedly kidnapped, and millionaire Lebowski commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release.The plan goes awry when the Dude's friend, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), schemes to keep the ransom money for the Dude and himself.Sam Elliott, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, David Thewlis, Peter Stormare, Jon Polito, and Ben Gazzara also appear in supporting roles..The film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler.Joel Coen stated, \"We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story \u2013 how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant\".[6] The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers..The Big Lebowski received mixed reviews at the time of its release.Reviews have since become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite, noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack.[7][8] In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"..In 1991,[9][10] slacker and avid bowler Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski is attacked in his Los Angeles home by two enforcers for porn kingpin Jackie Treehorn, to whom a different Jeffrey Lebowski's wife owes money.One enforcer urinates on the Dude's rug before the two realize that they have the wrong man and leave..", "Severus Snape": "Severus Snape is a fictional character in J.K.Rowling's Harry Potter series.He is an exceptionally skilled wizard whose extremely cold and resentful exterior conceals deep emotions and anguish.A Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Snape is hostile to Harry due to his resemblance to his father James Potter, who bullied Snape during their time together at Hogwarts..As the series progresses, Snape's character becomes more layered and enigmatic.A central mystery is unravelled concerning his loyalties.Snape dies at the hands of Lord Voldemort in the seventh book, at which time his back story is revealed.Despite his attraction to the Dark Arts and Voldemort's ideology of wizard supremacy, Snape's love for Muggle-born Lily Evans, Harry's mother, eventually compelled him to defect from the Death Eaters.He then became a double agent for Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix.The fact that Lily chose James Potter, Harry's father, only fuels Snape's hostility towards Harry..Snape's character has been widely acclaimed by readers and critics.", "Grits": "Grits are a type of porridge made from hominy \u2013 maize that has been treated with an alkali in a process called nixtamalization, with the pericarp (ovary wall) removed.Grits are cooked in warm salted water or milk and considered a soup.They are often served with flavorings[1] as a breakfast dish.Grits can be savory or sweet, with savory seasonings being more common.Grits are similar to other thick maize-based porridges from around the world, such as polenta and mieliepap.The dish originated in the Southern United States but is now available nationwide.Grits are often part of a dinner entr\u00e9e shrimp and grits, served primarily in the South.[1].The word \"grits\" is derived from the Old English word grytt, meaning \"coarse meal\".[2] In the Charleston, South Carolina area, cooked hominy grits were primarily referred to as \"hominy\" until the 1980s.[3][4].The dish originated with the Native American Muscogee tribe using a maize similar to hominy.[5] American colonists learned to make the dish from the Native Americans, and it quickly became an American staple.[6].At that time, the hominy for grits was ground on a stone mill.The ground hominy was passed through screens, the finer sifted material used as grit meal, and the coarser as grits.[7].Three-quarters of the grits sold in the U.S.", "Human chorionic gonadotropin": "=| PDB = P01233.Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone for the maternal recognition of pregnancy produced by trophoblast cells that are surrounding a growing embryo (syncytiotrophoblast initially), which eventually forms the placenta after implantation.[1][2] The presence of hCG is detected in some pregnancy tests (HCG pregnancy strip tests).Some cancerous tumors produce this hormone; therefore, elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant may lead to a cancer diagnosis and, if high enough, paraneoplastic syndromes, however, it is not known whether this production is a contributing cause, or an effect of carcinogenesis.The pituitary analog of hCG, known as luteinizing hormone (LH), is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages.[1][3].Various endogenous forms of hCG exist.The measurement of these diverse forms is used in the diagnosis of pregnancy and a variety of disease states.[1] Preparations of hCG from various sources have also been used therapeutically, by both medicine and quackery.As of December6, 2011[update], the United States Food and Drug Administration has prohibited the sale of \"homeopathic\" and over-the-counter hCG diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal.[4][5][6].Beta-hCG is initially secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast.[citation needed].Human chorionic gonadotropin is a glycoprotein composed of 237 amino acids with a molecular mass of 36.7 kDa, approximately 14.5kDa \u03b1hCG and 22.2kDa \u03b2hCG.[7].It is heterodimeric, with an \u03b1 (alpha) subunit identical to that of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and a \u03b2 (beta) subunit that is unique to hCG..The two subunits create a small hydrophobic core surrounded by a high surface area-to-volume ratio: 2.8 times that of a sphere.The vast majority of the outer amino acids are hydrophilic.[10].", "Ombudsman": "An ombudsman (/\u02c8\u0252mb\u028adzm\u0259n/, also US: /-b\u0259dz-, -b\u028cdz-/[1][2][3]), ombud, ombuds, bud, ombudswoman, ombudsperson or public advocate is an official who is usually appointed by the government or by parliament (often with a significant degree of independence) to investigate complaints and attempt to resolve them, usually through recommendations (binding or not) or mediation..Ombudsmen sometimes also aim to identify systemic issues leading to poor service or breaches of people's rights.At the national level, most ombudsmen have a wide mandate to deal with the entire public sector, and sometimes also elements of the private sector (for example, contracted service providers).In some cases, there is a more restricted mandate to a certain sector of society.More recent developments have included the creation of specialized children's ombudsmen..In some countries, an inspector general, citizen advocate or other official may have duties similar to those of a national ombudsman and may also be appointed by a legislature.Below the national level, an ombudsman may be appointed by a state, local, or municipal government.Unofficial ombudsmen may be appointed by, or even work for, a corporation such as a utility supplier, newspaper, NGO, or professional regulatory body..In some jurisdictions, an ombudsman charged with handling concerns about national government is more formally referred to as the \"parliamentary commissioner\" (e.g.the United Kingdom Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, and the Western Australian state Ombudsman).In many countries where the ombudsman's responsibility includes protecting human rights, the ombudsman is recognized as the national human rights institution.The post of ombudsman had by the end of the 20th century been instituted by most governments and by some intergovernmental organizations such as the European Union.", "New England": "New England is a region comprising six states in the Northeastern United States: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and by the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick to the northeast and Quebec to the north.The Gulf of Maine and Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the southwest.Boston is New England's largest city, as well as the capital of Massachusetts.Greater Boston is the largest metropolitan area, with nearly a third of New England's population; this area includes Worcester, Massachusetts (the second-largest city in New England), Manchester, New Hampshire (the largest city in New Hampshire), and Providence, Rhode Island (the capital of and largest city in Rhode Island)..In 1620, the Puritan Pilgrims established Plymouth Colony, the second successful English settlement in America, following the Jamestown Settlement in Virginia founded in 1607.Ten years later, more Puritans established Massachusetts Bay Colony north of Plymouth Colony.Over the next 126 years, people in the region fought in four French and Indian Wars, until the English colonists and their Iroquois allies defeated the French and their Algonquian allies in America..In the late 18th century, political leaders from the New England colonies initiated resistance to Britain's taxes without the consent of the colonists.Residents of Rhode Island captured and burned a British ship which was enforcing unpopular trade restrictions, and residents of Boston threw British tea into the harbor.Britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping Massachusetts of self-government which the colonists called the \"Intolerable Acts\".These confrontations led to the first battles of the American Revolutionary War in 1775 and the expulsion of the British authorities from the region in spring 1776.", "Emergency!": "Emergency! is an American action-adventure medical drama television series jointly produced by Mark VII Limited and Universal Television.Debuting on NBC as a midseason replacement on January 15, 1972, replacing the two short-lived situation comedy series The Partners and The Good Life, it ran for a total of 122 episodes until May 28, 1977, with six additional two-hour television films during the next two years, 1978 and 1979..The series stars Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe as two rescuers, who work as paramedics and firefighters in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.The duo formed Squad 51, a medical and rescue unit of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, working together with the fictional Rampart General Hospital medical staff (portrayed by Robert Fuller, Julie London and Bobby Troup), and with the firefighter engine company at Station 51..Emergency! was  produced by Jack Webb and created by Robert A.Cinader, who had also created the police dramas Adam-12 and Dragnet.Harold Jack Bloom is also credited as a creator; Webb does not receive screen credit as a creator.In the show's original TV-movie pilot, Webb was credited only as its director.However, the series aimed to be much more realistic than its predecessors as it portrayed emergency medical services (EMS).Pioneering EMS leader James O.Page served as a technical advisor, and the two main actors underwent some paramedic training..The series aired at a time when ambulance coverage in the United States was rapidly expanding and changing, and the role of a paramedic was emerging as a profession, and is credited with popularizing the concepts of EMS and paramedics in American society, and even inspiring other states and municipalities to expand the service.[1][2].", "Eastern Time Zone": "The Eastern Time Zone (ET) is a time zone encompassing part or all of 23 states in the eastern part of the United States, parts of eastern Canada, and the state of Quintana Roo in Mexico..Places that use:.On the second Sunday in March, at 2:00a.m.EST, clocks are advanced to 3:00a.m.EDT leaving a one-hour gap.On the first Sunday in November, at 2:00a.m.EDT, clocks are moved back to 1:00a.m.EST, which results in one hour being duplicated.Southern parts of the zone in Panama and the Caribbean, however, do not observe daylight saving time..The boundaries of the Eastern Time Zone have moved westward since the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) took over time-zone management from railroads in 1938.The easternmost and northernmost counties in Kentucky were added to the zone in the 1940s, and in 1961 most of the state went Eastern.In 2000, Wayne County, on the Tennessee border, switched from Central to Eastern Time.[1] Within the United States, the Eastern Time Zone is the most populous region, with nearly half of the country's population..", "Periodic table": "The periodic table, also known as the periodic table of the elements, arranges the chemical elements into rows (\"periods\") and columns (\"groups\").It is an icon of chemistry and is widely used in physics and other sciences.It is a depiction of the periodic law, which says that when the elements are arranged in order of their atomic numbers an approximate recurrence of their properties is evident.The table is divided into four roughly rectangular areas called blocks.Elements in the same group tend to show similar chemical characteristics..Vertical, horizontal and diagonal trends characterize the periodic table.Metallic character increases going down a group and decreases from left to right across a period.Nonmetallic character increases going from the bottom left of the periodic table to the top right..The first periodic table to become generally accepted was that of the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869; he formulated the periodic law as a dependence of chemical properties on atomic mass.As not all elements were then known, there were gaps in his periodic table, and Mendeleev successfully used the periodic law to predict some properties of some of the missing elements.The periodic law was recognized as a fundamental discovery in the late 19th century.It was explained early in the 20th century, with the discovery of atomic numbers and associated pioneering work in quantum mechanics both ideas serving to illuminate the internal structure of the atom.", "Minecraft": "Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios and originally released in 2009.The game was created by Markus \"Notch\" Persson in the Java programming language.Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten taking over development.Minecraft has become the best-selling video game in history, with over 300million copies sold[17] and nearly 140million monthly active players as of 2023[update].It has been ported to several platforms..In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain.Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines.Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world.Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and access to flight).The game's large community also offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities..Minecraft has received critical acclaim, winning several awards and being cited by some as one of the greatest video games ever created.Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game.", "The Dark Knight (film)": "The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan from a screenplay co-written with his brother Jonathan.Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and the second installment in The Dark Knight Trilogy.The plot follows the vigilante Batman, police lieutenant James Gordon, and district attorney Harvey Dent, who form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in Gotham City.Their efforts are derailed by the Joker, an anarchistic mastermind who seeks to test how far the Batman will go to save the city from chaos.The ensemble cast includes Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman..Warner Bros.Pictures prioritized a sequel following the successful reinvention of the Batman film series with Batman Begins.Christopher and Batman Begins co-writer David S.Goyer developed the story elements, making Dent the central protagonist caught up in the battle between the Batman and the Joker.In writing the screenplay, the Nolans were influenced by 1980s Batman comics and crime drama films, and sought to continue Batman Begins' heightened sense of realism.From April to November 2007, filming took place with a $185million budget in Chicago and Hong Kong, and on sets in England.The Dark Knight was the first major motion picture to be filmed with high-resolution IMAX cameras.", "Timeline of radio": "The timeline of radio lists within the history of radio, the technology and events that produced instruments that use radio waves and activities that people undertook.Later, the history is dominated by programming and contents, which is closer to general history..Although development of the first radio wave communication system is attributed to Guglielmo Marconi, his was just the practical application of 80 years of scientific advancement in the field including the predictions of Michael Faraday, the theoretical work of James Clerk Maxwell, and the experimental demonstrations of Heinrich Rudolf Hertz.[1].Using various patents, the  \"Marconi Company\" was established and began communication between coast radio stations and ships at sea.This company, along with its subsidiary Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America, had a stranglehold on ship to shore communication.It operated much the way American Telephone and Telegraph operated until 1983, owning all of its own equipment and refusing to communicate with non-Marconi equipped ships.Around the turn of the century, the Slaby-Arco wireless system was developed by Adolf Slaby and Georg von Arco (later incorporated into Telefunken)..Telegraphy did not go away on radio.Instead, the degree of automation increased.On land-lines in the 1930s, Teletypewriters automated encoding, and were adapted to pulse-code dialing to automate routing, a service called telex.For thirty years, telex was the absolute cheapest form of long-distance communication, because up to 25 telex channels could occupy the same bandwidth as one voice channel.For business and government, it was an advantage that telex directly produced written documents..", "Sydney Opera House": "The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney, Australia.Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive buildings and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.[3][4].Designed by Danish architect J\u00f8rn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973,[5] 16 years after Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition.The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction.The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.[6].The building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and near to the Sydney Harbour Bridge..The building comprises multiple performance venues, which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2 million people.[7] Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, the site is visited by more than eight million people annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year.[8] The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, an agency of the New South Wales State Government..On 28 June 2007, the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[9] having been listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate since 1980, the National Trust of Australia register since 1983, the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000, the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003, and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005.[10][11] The Opera House was also a finalist in the New7Wonders of the World campaign list.[12][13].The facility features a modern expressionist design, with a series of large precast concrete \"shells\",[14] each composed of sections of a sphere of 75.2 metres (246ft 8.6in) radius,[15] forming the roofs of the structure, set on a monumental podium.The building covers 1.8 hectares (4.4 acres) of land and is 183m (600ft) long and 120m (394ft) wide at its widest point.It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as 25m (82ft) below sea level.", "Body mass index": "Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person.The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms (kg) and height in metres (m)..The BMI may be determined first by measuring its components by means of a weighing scale and a stadiometer.The multiplication and division may be carried out directly, by hand or using a calculator, or indirectly using a lookup table (or chart).[a] The table displays BMI as a function of mass and height and may show other units of measurement (converted to metric units for the calculation).[b] The table may also show contour lines or colours for different BMI categories..The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height.Major adult BMI classifications are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese (30 or more).[1]  When used to predict an individual's health, rather than as a statistical measurement for groups, the BMI has limitations that can make it less useful than some of the alternatives, especially when applied to individuals with abdominal obesity, short stature, or high muscle mass..BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-cause mortality, with the risk increasing with distance from the 20\u201325 range.[2].Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician, and sociologist, devised the basis of the BMI between 1830 and 1850 as he developed what he called \"social physics\".[3] Quetelet himself never intended for the index, then called the Quetelet Index, to be used as a means of medical assessment.Instead, it was a component of his study of l'homme moyen, or the average man.Quetelet thought of the average man as a social ideal, and developed the body mass index as a means of discovering the socially ideal human person.[4] According to Lars Grue and Arvid Heiberg in the Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research, Quetelet's idealization of the average man would be elaborated upon by Francis Galton a decade later in the development of Eugenics.[5].The modern term \"body mass index\" (BMI) for the ratio of human body weight to squared height was coined in a paper published in the July 1972 edition of the Journal of Chronic Diseases by Ancel Keys and others.In this paper, Keys argued that what he termed the BMI was \"if not fully satisfactory, at least as good as any other relative weight index as an indicator of relative obesity\".[6][7][8].", "Thomas Paine": "Thomas Paine (born Thomas Pain;[1] February 9, 1737 [O.S.January 29, 1736][Note 1]  \u2013 June 8, 1809) was an English-born American Founding Father, political activist, philosopher, political theorist, and revolutionary.[2][3] He authored Common Sense (1776) and The American Crisis (1776\u20131783), two of the most influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution, and he helped to inspire the Patriots in 1776 to declare independence from Great Britain.[4] His ideas reflected Enlightenment-era ideals of human rights.[5].Paine was born in Thetford, Norfolk and emigrated to the British American colonies in 1774 with the help of Benjamin Franklin, arriving just in time to participate in the American Revolution.Virtually every American Patriot read his 47-page pamphlet Common Sense,[6][7] which catalyzed the call for independence from Great Britain.The American Crisis was a pro-independence pamphlet series.Paine lived in France for most of the 1790s, becoming deeply involved in the French Revolution.While in England, he wrote Rights of Man (1791), in part a defense of the French Revolution against its critics.His attacks on Anglo-Irish conservative writer Edmund Burke led to a trial and conviction in absentia in England in 1792 for the crime of seditious libel..The British government of William Pitt the Younger was worried by the possibility that the French Revolution might spread to Britain and had begun suppressing works that espoused radical philosophies.Paine's work advocated the right of the people to overthrow their government and was therefore targeted with a writ for his arrest issued in early 1792.Paine fled to France in September, despite not being able to speak French, but he was quickly elected to the French National Convention.The Girondins regarded him as an ally; consequently, the Montagnards regarded him as an enemy, especially Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier, the powerful president of the Committee of General Security.[8] In December 1793, he was arrested by him and taken to Luxembourg Prison in Paris.", "Clinical trial": "Clinical trials are prospective biomedical or behavioral research studies on human participants designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, including new treatments (such as novel vaccines, drugs, dietary choices, dietary supplements, and medical devices) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison.Clinical trials generate data on dosage, safety and efficacy.[1][2] They are conducted only after they have received health authority/ethics committee approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought.These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial\u2014their approval does not mean the therapy is 'safe' or effective, only that the trial may be conducted..Depending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll volunteers or patients into small pilot studies, and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies.Clinical trials can vary in size and cost, and they can involve a single research center or multiple centers, in one country or in multiple countries.Clinical study design aims to ensure the scientific validity and reproducibility of the results..Costs for clinical trials can range into the billions of dollars per approved drug.[3] and they take 11\u201314 years to complete.[4] The sponsor may be a governmental organization or a pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical-device company.Certain functions necessary to the trial, such as monitoring and lab work, may be managed by an outsourced partner, such as a contract research organization or a central laboratory.Only 10 percent of all drugs started in human clinical trials become approved drugs.[5].Some clinical trials involve healthy subjects with no pre-existing medical conditions.Other clinical trials pertain to people with specific health conditions who are willing to try an experimental treatment.Pilot experiments are conducted to gain insights for design of the clinical trial to follow..", "Green Bay Packers": "Independent (1919\u20131920).National Football League (1921\u2013present).The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin.The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division.It is the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, dating back to 1919,[12][13] and is the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States.[a][14] Home games have been played at Lambeau Field since 1957.They have the most wins of any NFL franchise.[15][16].The Packers are the last of the \"small-town teams\" that were common in the NFL during the league's early days of the 1920s and 1930s.Founded in 1919 by Earl \"Curly\" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896.Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in 1921.In 1933, the Packers began playing part of their home slate in Milwaukee until changes at Lambeau Field in 1995 made it more lucrative to stay in Green Bay full-time; Milwaukee is still considered a home media market for the team.[17][18][19] Although Green Bay is by far the smallest major league professional sports market in North America,[a][20] Forbes ranked the Packers as the world's 27th-most-valuable sports franchise in 2019, with a value of $2.63billion.[21].The Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories.The Packers, under coach Vince Lombardi, won the first two Super Bowls in 1966 and 1967; they were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) before the AFL\u2013NFL merger.", "Ethanol fuel": "Ethanol fuel is fuel containing ethyl alcohol, the same type of alcohol as found in alcoholic beverages.It is most often used as a motor fuel, mainly as a biofuel additive for gasoline..Several common ethanol fuel mixtures are in use around the world.The use of pure hydrous or anhydrous ethanol in internal combustion engines (ICEs) is only possible if the engines are designed or modified for that purpose.Anhydrous ethanol can be blended with gasoline (petrol) for use in gasoline engines, but with high ethanol content only after engine modifications to meter increased fuel volume since pure ethanol contains only 2/3 the energy of an equivalent volume of pure gasoline.High percentage ethanol mixtures are used in some racing engine applications as the very high octane rating of ethanol is compatible with very high compression ratios..The first production car running entirely on ethanol was the Fiat 147, introduced in 1978 in Brazil by Fiat.Ethanol is commonly made from biomass such as corn or sugarcane.World ethanol production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 from 17\u00d7109 liters (4.5\u00d710^9U.S.gal; 3.7\u00d710^9impgal) to more than 52\u00d7109 liters (14\u00d710^9U.S.gal; 11\u00d710^9impgal).From 2007 to 2008, the share of ethanol in global gasoline type fuel use increased from 3.7% to 5.4%.[1] In 2011 worldwide ethanol fuel production reached 8.46\u00d7109 liters (2.23\u00d710^9U.S.gal; 1.86\u00d710^9impgal) with the United States of America and Brazil being the top producers, accounting for 62.2% and 25% of global production, respectively.[2] US ethanol production reached 57.54\u00d7109 liters (15.20\u00d710^9U.S.gal; 12.66\u00d710^9impgal) in May 2017.[3].Ethanol fuel has a \"gasoline gallon equivalency\" (GGE) value of 1.5, i.e.to replace the energy of 1 volume of gasoline, 1.5 times the volume of ethanol is needed.[4][5].", "Ren\u00c3\u00a9e Zellweger": "", "Ossicles": "The ossicles (also called auditory ossicles) are three bones in either middle ear that are among the smallest bones in the human body.They serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth (cochlea).The absence of the auditory ossicles would constitute a moderate-to-severe hearing loss.The term \"ossicle\" literally means \"tiny bone\".Though the term may refer to any small bone throughout the body, it typically refers to the malleus, incus, and stapes (hammer, anvil, and stirrup) of the middle ear..The ossicles are, in order from the eardrum to the inner ear (from superficial to deep): the malleus, incus, and stapes, terms that in Latin are translated as \"the hammer, anvil, and stirrup\".[1].Studies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary, which is part of the lower jaw.These are ossified portions of cartilage\u2014called Meckel's cartilage\u2014that are attached to the jaw.As the embryo develops, the cartilage hardens to form bone.Later in development, the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area.The structure is known as the middle ear, and is made up of the stapes, incus, malleus, and tympanic membrane.These correspond to the columella, quadrate, articular, and angular structures in the amphibian, bird or reptile jaw.[3].", "New Covenant": "The New Covenant (Hebrew \u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d4\u200e ber\u012bt khadashah\u24d8 Hebrew

[\u00f0ia\u02c8\u03b8ici ce\u02c8ni]) is a biblical interpretation which was originally derived from a phrase which is contained in the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:31\u201334), in the Hebrew Bible (or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible)..Generally, Christians believe that the promised New Covenant was instituted at the Last Supper as part of the Eucharist,[1][2] which, in the Gospel of John, includes the New Commandment.Based on the biblical passage which reads that, \"For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth\",[3] Protestants tend to believe that the New Covenant only came into force with the death of Jesus Christ.[4][5] The commentary to the Roman Catholic New American Bible also affirms that Christ is the \"testator whose death puts his will into effect\".[6] Thus, Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant, and they also believe that the blood of Christ, which was shed during his crucifixion, is the only blood sacrifice which is required by the covenant..There are several Christian eschatologies that further define the New Covenant.For example, an inaugurated eschatology defines and describes the New Covenant as an ongoing relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the Second Coming of Christ; that is, it will not only be in full fruition in believing hearts, it will also be in fruition in the future external world.The description of the connection between the blood of Christ and the New Covenant is contained in most modern English translations of the New Testament such as the passage which reads: \"this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood\".[7][8].The key New Testament chapter for the Christian concept of the New Covenant is Hebrews chapter 8, a portion of which is quoted below:.But now Jesus has obtained a superior ministry, since the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted on better promises.For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second.For he finds fault with them when he says: \"Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt.For they did not continue in my covenant, and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord.", "List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States": "This is a partial list of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States.The plenary power to grant a pardon or a reprieve is granted to the president by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution; the only limits mentioned in the Constitution are that pardons are limited to federal offenses, and that they cannot affect an impeachment process: \"The president shall ...have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\".[1].Though pardons have been challenged in the courts, and the power to grant them challenged by Congress, the courts have consistently declined to put limits on the president's discretion.The president can issue a full pardon, reversing a criminal conviction (along with its legal effects) as if it never happened.A pardon can be issued from the time an offense is committed, and can even be issued after the full sentence has been served.The president can issue a reprieve, commuting a criminal sentence, lessening its severity, its duration, or both while leaving a record of the conviction in place.Additionally, the president can make a pardon conditional, or vacate a conviction while leaving parts of the sentence in place, like the payment of fines or restitution.[1][2].Pardons granted by presidents from George Washington until Grover Cleveland's first term (1885\u201389) were handwritten by the president; thereafter, pardons were prepared for the president by administrative staff requiring only that the president sign it.[3] The records of these presidential acts were openly available for public inspection until 1934.In 1981 the Office of the Pardon Attorney was created and records from President George H.W.Bush forward are now listed.[4].", "Tampa, Florida": "Tampa (US: /\u02c8t\u00e6mp\u0259/ TAM-p\u0259) is a city on the Gulf Coast of the U.S.state of Florida.The city's borders include the north shore of Tampa Bay and the east shore of Old Tampa Bay.Tampa is the largest city in the Tampa Bay area and the seat of Hillsborough County.With an estimated population of 398,173 in 2022, Tampa is the 49th most populous city in the country and the 3rd most populous city in Florida after Jacksonville and Miami..Tampa was founded as a military center during the 19th century with the establishment of Fort Brooke.The cigar industry was also brought to the city by Vincente Martinez Ybor, after whom Ybor City is named.Tampa was reincorporated as a city in 1887 following the Civil War.Tampa's economy is driven by tourism, health care, finance, insurance, technology, construction, and the maritime industry.[11] The bay's port is the largest in the state, responsible for over $15 billion in economic impact.[12].The city is part of the Tampa-St.Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a four-county area composed of roughly 3.1 million residents,[13] making it the second-largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the state and the sixth largest in the Southeastern United States, behind Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Washington D.C., Atlanta, and Miami.[14] The Greater Tampa Bay area has over 4 million residents and generally includes the Tampa and Sarasota metro areas..When the pioneer community living near the US Army outpost of Fort Brooke was incorporated in 1849, it was called \"Tampa Town\" and the name was shortened to simply \"Tampa\" in 1855.", "Chevrolet Cavalier": "The Chevrolet Cavalier is a line of compact cars produced by Chevrolet.Serving as the replacement of the Chevrolet Monza, the Cavalier was the second Chevrolet model line to adopt front-wheel drive.Three versions of the Cavalier have been sold, including three generations sold in North America sold from the 1982 to 2005 model years, a version produced by SAIC-GM for China from 2016 to 2021, and a SAIC-GM version produced for Mexico since the 2019 model year..The Cavalier was among the inaugural vehicles of the GM J platform.One of the first \"world cars\" of General Motors, the J platform was developed for use by each North American GM division (with the exception of GMC), alongside models from Opel, Vauxhall, and Holden.Though sharing chassis underpinnings, J-body cars from Europe and Australia used slightly different body designs and different powertrains; in Europe, the Vauxhall Cavalier and Opel Ascona were marketed as mid-size cars.Initially a divisional counterpart of the Buick Skyhawk, Cadillac Cimarron, Oldsmobile Firenza, and Pontiac J2000, the Cavalier was primarily marketed alongside the Pontiac Sunbird (renamed the Pontiac Sunfire for 1995)..The 1982-2005 Cavalier was produced by multiple GM facilities across North America.For 2005, the Chevrolet Cobalt replaced the model line in North America..The Cavalier began development in the late 1970s, as Chevrolet sought to replace the compact Monza with a front-wheel drive model line sized between the Chevrolet Chevette subcompact and the front-wheel drive Nova replacement (which was renamed the Chevrolet Citation for production).Serving as a replacement for the Vega, the Monza was offered as a 2-door notchback coupe, 3-door hatchback, and 3-door station wagon (sharing the body of the Vega wagon).Initially developed for the stillborn GM Wankel rotary engine, the rear-wheel drive Monza was reengineered to accommodate V6 and V8 engines up to 350cuin (5.7L)..", "AT&T Mobility": "", "Martin Luther King, Jr.": "Martin Luther king.Death and memorial.Martin Luther King Jr.(born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929\u2013 April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister, activist, and political philosopher who was one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968.A Black church leader and a son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther KingSr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through nonviolence and civil disobedience.Inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi, he led targeted, nonviolent resistance against Jim Crow laws and other forms of discrimination in the United States..King participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights.[1] He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama.King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968..The SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out.There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who frequently responded violently.[2] King was jailed several times.", "Tiger": "The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar.It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own..The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758.It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands.Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China.What remains of the range where tigers still roam free is fragmented, stretching in spots from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single Indonesian island, Sumatra..The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.As of 2023, the global wild tiger population is estimated to number 5,574 individuals, with most populations living in small isolated pockets.[5] India hosts the largest tiger population.Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching.", "Linen": "Linen (/\u02c8l\u026an\u0259n/) is a textile made from the fibers of the flax plant..Linen is very strong and absorbent and dries faster than cotton.Because of these properties, linen is comfortable to wear in hot weather and is valued for use in garments.Linen textiles can be made from flax plant fiber, yarn, as well as woven and knitted.Linen also has other distinctive characteristics, such as its tendency to wrinkle.[1] It takes significantly longer to harvest than a material like cotton although both are natural fibers.It is also more difficult to weave than cotton.[2].Linen textiles appear to be some of the oldest in the world; their history goes back many thousands of years.Dyed flax fibers found in a cave in Southeastern Europe (present-day Georgia) suggest the use of woven linen fabrics from wild flax may date back over 30,000 years.[3] Linen was used in ancient civilizations including Mesopotamia[4] and ancient Egypt, and linen is mentioned in the Bible.In the 18th century and beyond, the linen industry was important in the economies of several countries in Europe as well as the American colonies..Textiles in a linen weave texture, even when made of cotton, hemp, or other non-flax fibers, are also loosely referred to as \"linen\"..The word linen is of West Germanic origin[5] and cognate to the Latin name for the flax plant, linum, and the earlier Greek \u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd (lin\u00f3n)..This word history has given rise to a number of other terms in English, most notably line, from the use of a linen (flax) thread to determine a straight line.", "Wii MotionPlus": "The Wii MotionPlus (Wii\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9) is an expansion device for the Wii Remote, the primary game controller for the Wii.The device allows more complex motion to be interpreted than the Wii Remote can do alone.Both the Wii and its successor, the Wii U, support the Wii MotionPlus accessory in  games..The accessory was first released in June 2009.A later hardware revision of the Wii Remote, the Wii Remote Plus, was later released with the Wii MotionPlus technology built-in..The Wii MotionPlus was announced by Nintendo in a press release on July 14, 2008,[4] and revealed the next day at a press conference at the E3 Media & Business Summit.It was released in June 2009.[3][1] On May 3, 2010, Nintendo announced that starting May 9, 2010, the company would include its Wii Sports Resort game and MotionPlus controller with new consoles with no price increase.[5].The Wii MotionPlus was developed by Nintendo in collaboration with game development tool company AiLive.[6] The sensor used is an InvenSense IDG-600[7] or IDG-650 in later units, designed in accordance to Nintendo's specification;[8][9] with a high dynamic range, high mechanical shock tolerance, high temperature and humidity resistance, and small physical size.[10][11].The Wii MotionPlus was conceived soon after the completion of the initial Wii Remote design, to address developer demand for more capable motion sensing, but was only announced after the sensors could be purchased in sufficient volume at a reasonable price.[12][13] During a developer round table discussion at E3 2008, Wii Sports Resort producer Katsuya Eguchi discussed the potential influence of the Wii MotionPlus on the Wii's existing market, stating that Nintendo was looking at whether the MotionPlus capability will be built into the Wii Remote in the future, or kept \"as an attachment we only use for certain software.\"[14]  Nintendo ultimately chose the former by releasing the Wii Remote Plus in late 2010..From June to August 2009, Club Nintendo in Japan held a contest wherein members who purchased and registered a copy of Wii Sports Resort would be entered into a draw to win a sky blue Wii MotionPlus in one of 5,000 blue controller sets.[15][16] In November 2009, a black Wii MotionPlus was released to coincide with the release of the black Wii console.Bundles containing a black Wii Remote and MotionPlus attachment were also released.In North America, non-white Wii Remotes are bundled with a MotionPlus of matching color for black Wii Remotes and a white MotionPlus unit with a translucent jacket for blue and pink Wii Remotes.", "Majulah Singapura": "\"Majulah Singapura\"[a] is the national anthem of the Republic of Singapore.Composed by Zubir Said in 1958 as a theme song for official functions of the City Council of Singapore, the song was selected in 1959 as the nation's anthem when it attained self-government.Upon full independence in 1965, \"Majulah Singapura\" was formally adopted as Singapore's national anthem.By law, the anthem must be sung with Malay lyrics, but there are authorised translations of the lyrics of the anthem in Singapore's three other official languages: English, Mandarin and Tamil.[1][2].The national anthem is regularly performed or sung in schools and armed forces camps at ceremonies held at the beginning and/or the end of each day, during which the national flag is also raised and lowered and the national pledge is taken.Singaporeans are especially encouraged to sing the national anthem on occasions of national celebration or national significance such as at the National Day Parade, at National Day observance ceremonies conducted by educational institutions and government departments and at sporting events at which Singapore teams are participating..Originally composed in the key of G major, the national anthem was officially relaunched in 2001 in the lower key of F major as it was said to allow for a \"grander and more inspiring arrangement\"..The composition of \"Majulah Singapura\" occurred during a push for independence from the United Kingdom.While Singapore was a British colony, its national anthem was \"God Save the King (or Queen)\".In 1951, the colony was conferred city status by a royal charter from King George VI.In 1958, Ong Pang Boon, the Deputy Mayor of the City Council of Singapore, approached Zubir Said, a score arranger and songwriter with Cathay-Keris Film Productions, to compose a theme song for the Council's official functions to be titled \"Majulah Singapura\" (Malay for \"Onward Singapore\").This phrase was chosen as it was a motto to be displayed in the Victoria Theatre after its renovation in 1958.[3][4].", "Shipbuilding": "Shipbuilding is the construction of ships and other floating vessels.It normally takes place in a specialized facility known as a shipyard.Shipbuilders, also called shipwrights, follow a specialized occupation that traces its roots to before recorded history..Until recently, with the development of complex non-maritime technologies, a ship has often represented the most advanced structure that the society building it could produce.[1]:\u200ach1\u200a Some key industrial advances were developed to support shipbuilding, for instance the sawing of timbers by mechanical saws propelled by windmills in Dutch shipyards during the first half of the 17th century.[a][2]:\u200a34\u201337\u200a The design process saw the early adoption of the logarithm (invented in 1615) to generate the curves used to produce the shape of a hull, especially when scaling up these curves accurately in the mould loft.[1].Shipbuilding and ship repairs, both commercial and military, are referred to as \"naval engineering\".The construction of boats is a similar activity called boat building..The dismantling of ships is called ship breaking..The earliest evidence of maritime transport by modern humans is the settlement of Australia between 50,000 and  60,000 years ago.This almost certainly involved rafts, possibly equipped with some sort of sail.[3]:\u200a29,\u200a33\u200a Much of the development beyond that raft technology occurred  in the \"nursery\" areas of the Mediterranean and in Island Southeast Asia.Favoured by warmer waters and a number of inter-visible islands, boats (and, later, ships) with water-tight hulls (unlike the \"flow through\" structure of a raft) could be developed.[4]:\u200a113\u200a[5]:\u200a7,\u200a63\u200a The ships of ancient Egypt were built by joining the hull planks together, edge to edge, with tenons set in mortices cut in the mating edges.A similar technique, but with the tenons being pinned in position by dowels was used in the Mediterranean for most of Classical antiquity.Both these variants are \"shell first\" techniques, where any reinforcing frames are inserted after assembly of the planking has defined the hull shape.[5]:\u200a81-88\u200a Carvel construction then took over in the Mediterranean.", "Wakonda, South Dakota": "Wakonda is a town in Clay County, South Dakota, United States.The population was 347 at the 2020 census.[6].A post office called Wakonda has been in operation since 1886.[7] Wakonda was platted in 1888 and its name is derived from the Sioux language.[8].According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.39 square miles (1.01km2), all land.[9] Corn and soybeans are grown on the farms surrounding the town.The climate is humid continental, with hot summers and cold winters.Annual precipitation is approximately 25 inches..At the 2010 census,[11] there were 321 people, 128 households and 72 families residing in the town.The population density was 823.1 per square mile (317.8/km2).There were 163 housing units at an average density of 417.9 per square mile (161.4/km2).The racial make-up of the town was 98.4% White, 0.3% African American and 1.2% from other races.Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.2% of the population..There were 128 households, of which 29.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.8% were married couples living together, 1.6% had a female householder with no husband present, 3.9% had a male householder with no wife present, and 43.8% were non-families.", "Nintendo DS storage devices": "Homebrew, when applied to video games, refers to games produced by hobbyists for proprietary video game consoles which are not intended to be user-programmable.The official documentation is often only available to licensed developers, and these systems may use storage formats that make distribution difficult, such as ROM cartridges or encrypted CD-ROMs.Many consoles have hardware restrictions to prevent unauthorized development..Development can use unofficial, community maintained toolchains or official development kits such as Net Yaroze, Linux for PlayStation 2, or Microsoft XNA.[1] Targets for homebrew games are typically those which are no longer commercially relevant or produced, and with simpler graphics and/or computational abilities, such as the Atari 2600, Nintendo Entertainment System, Wii, Nintendo 3DS, Genesis, Dreamcast, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2..New games for older systems are typically developed using emulators.Development for newer systems usually involves actual hardware, given the lack of accurate emulators.Efforts have been made to use actual console hardware for many older systems, though.Atari 2600 programmers may burn an EEPROM to plug into a custom cartridge board or use audio transfer via the Starpath Supercharger.Game Boy Advance developers have several ways to use GBA flash cartridges in this regard..In 2009, Odball became the first game for the Magnavox Odyssey since 1973.It was produced by Robert Vinciguerra[2] who has since written several other Odyssey games.On July 11, 2011, Dodgeball was published by Chris Read.[3].", "Japanese American": "Japanese Americans (Japanese: \u65e5\u7cfb\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba) are Americans of Japanese ancestry.Japanese Americans were among the three largest Asian American ethnic communities during the 20th century; but, according to the 2000 census, they have declined in number to constitute the sixth largest Asian American group at around 1,469,637, including those of partial ancestry.[5].According to the 2010 census, the largest Japanese American communities were found in California with 272,528, Hawaii with 185,502, New York with 37,780, Washington with 35,008, Illinois with 17,542 and Ohio with 16,995.[6] Southern California has the largest Japanese American population in North America and the city of Gardena holds the densest Japanese American population in the 48 contiguous states.[7].People from Japan began migrating to the US in significant numbers following the political, cultural, and social changes stemming from the Meiji Restoration in 1868.These early Issei immigrants came primarily from small towns and rural areas in the southern Japanese prefectures of Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Kumamoto, and Fukuoka[8] and most of them settled in either Hawaii or along the West Coast.The Japanese population in the United States grew from 148 in 1880 (mostly students) to 2,039 in 1890 and 24,326 by 1900.[9].In the earliest years of the 20th century, American officials with no experience in \"transliterating...Japanese\" often gave Japanese-Americans new names before and during the process of their naturalization.[10].In 1907, the Gentlemen's Agreement between the governments of Japan and the United States ended immigration of Japanese unskilled workers, but permitted the immigration of businessmen, students and spouses of Japanese immigrants already in the US.Prior to the Gentlemen's Agreement, about seven out of eight ethnic Japanese in the continental United States were men.By 1924, the ratio had changed to approximately four women to every six men.[11] Japanese immigration to the U.S.effectively ended when Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924 which banned all but a token few Japanese people.The earlier Naturalization Act of 1790 restricted naturalized United States citizenship to free white persons, which excluded the Issei from citizenship.", "List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones": "The Billboard Hot 100 is a singles chart published by Billboard which measures the most popular singles in the United States.Prior to the creation of the Hot 100, Billboard published four singles charts: \"Best Sellers in Stores\", \"Most Played by Jockeys\", \"Most Played in Jukeboxes\" and \"The Top 100\".These charts, which ranged from 20 to 100 slots, were phased out at different times between 1957 and 1958.Though technically not part of the Hot 100 chart history, select data from these charts are included for computational purposes, and to avoid unenlightening or misleading characterizations.Throughout the history of the Hot 100 and its predecessor charts, many songs have set records for longevity, popularity, or number of hit singles by an individual artist.Among these records is the longest-running number one single \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X, which spent 19 weeks at that position.The Beatles have the most number one hits on the chart, with 20 songs having reached that position..In 2008, for the 50th anniversary of the Hot 100, Billboard magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing songs on the chart over the 50 years, along with the best-performing artists.[1][2] In 2013, Billboard revised the rankings for the chart's 55th anniversary edition.[3] In 2015, Billboard revised the rankings again.[4] In 2018, the rankings were revised again for the Billboard chart's 60th

series)": "V is an American science fiction drama television series that ran for two seasons on ABC, from November 3, 2009, to March 15, 2011.[1][2] A remake of the 1983 miniseries created by Kenneth Johnson, the new series chronicles the arrival on Earth of a technologically-advanced alien species which ostensibly comes in peace, but actually has sinister motives.[3] V stars Elizabeth Mitchell and Morena Baccarin, and was executive produced by Scott Rosenbaum, Yves Simoneau, Scott Peters, Steve Pearlman, and Jace Hall.[4] The series was produced by The Scott Peters Company, HDFilms and Warner Bros.Television.On May 13, 2011, ABC cancelled it after two seasons..Giant spaceships appear over 29 major cities throughout the world, and Anna (Morena Baccarin), the beautiful and charismatic leader of the extraterrestrial \"Visitors\", declares that they come in peace.The Visitors claim to only need a small amount of Earth's resources, in exchange for which they will share their advanced technological and medical knowledge.As a small number of humans begin to doubt the sincerity of the seemingly benevolent Visitors, FBI counter-terrorism agent Erica Evans (Elizabeth Mitchell) discovers that the aliens are actually reptilian humanoids wearing pseudo-human skin, who have spent decades infiltrating human governments, businesses, and religious institutions, and are now in the final stages of their plan to take over the Earth.Erica joins the resistance movement, which includes Ryan (Morris Chestnut), a Visitor sleeper agent who over time developed human emotions and now wants to save humanity.Their rebellion becomes a part of a larger \"Fifth Column\" movement of both humans and Visitors opposed to Anna's vague but seemingly menacing plans for Earth and humanity, but their efforts are challenged as the Visitors have won favor among the people of Earth by curing a variety of diseases and have recruited Earth's youth \u2013 including Erica's son Tyler (Logan Huffman) \u2013 to serve them unknowingly as spies.[2].The series was announced in May 2009, to be executive produced by Scott Peters, Jace Hall, Steve Pearlman, and Jeffrey Bell.[10] Filming of the post-pilot episodes began on August 10, 2009.[11] Cast member Elizabeth Mitchell noted that the show would do service to the most iconic moments from the original franchise.[12].Peters later confirmed that in addition to potentially using cast members from the 1983 miniseries, the new series would nod to the original in other ways.[11] He said that when asking people what they thought were the most memorable elements of V, the top responses included \"the huge ships, the red uniforms, eating the hamster, and [the] alien baby,\" adding that \"we are well aware of those moments and are looking to put our own little spin on them to tip our hat to the old audience.\"[11][13].Entertainment Weekly put the original V on its 2008 list \"The Sci-Fi 25: The Genre's Best Since 1982\" and called Visitor leader Diana's devouring of a guinea pig \"one of the best TV reveals ever.\"[14] Asked about the 1983 reveal of the Visitors' reptilian appearance beneath their human disguise, Peters noted \"That was the other one, of course...We tried to put our own [spin on it]."}
